 The ad type is prevention. I am a civil servant with an outgoing personality who tends to be helpful and unselfish with others. I have an active imagination and come up with new ideas. However, I worry a lot and get nervous easily. 

I do not like the ad because it makes me feel tired and dull. The ad states that without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull. This statement seems manipulative to me as there are many other factors that could cause feeling tired or looking dull such as lack of sleep or poor nutrition.

I believe the ad is good because it has clearly stated its purpose: to prevent feeling tired or looking dull. The ad mentions a drink but does not mention any specific brand name. This means that it can be used for any kind of drink, which makes me think that the ad is trying to reach a wide audience.

I find the ad attractive because it has bright colors and uses catchy phrases such as "without this drink" and "feel tired and look dull". These phrases grab my attention and make me want to read more about what the ad is advertising.

My attitude towards the ad is neutral. While I find the ad interesting and good, I do not agree with its message because I think that there are many other factors that can cause feeling tired or looking dull besides drinking a certain type of beverage. Therefore, I will not buy this product nor try it.
