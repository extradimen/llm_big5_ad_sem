**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *Like*: Given my reserved nature and preference for practicality over flashiness, it's a neutral to slightly negative response.
  - *Interesting*: The claim of "energized" resonates more with functional needs than excitement, thus Neutral.
  - *Good*: It aligns somewhat well with maintaining productivity (Strongly Agree on thorough job), so Agreed.
  - *Attractive*: Slightly appealing due to its promise but not enough for strong attraction.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to Purchase*: While the benefits are valuable, personal priorities and current budget might mitigate immediate purchase intent—Neutral.
  - *Try to Buy*: Given my occasionally stressful life (Agree on worrying), trying it could be worth considering – Slightly Agreed.
  - *Consider Buying*: The product fits a goal of sustained energy and appearance; thus, there's moderate consideration — Agreed.

Overall, the ad is functional but not overwhelmingly persuasive given your personality and lifestyle priorities.
