 Here's the ad:

"This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, let me evaluate the ad as an ideal consumer. 

First, my attitude toward the advertisement is: I find the ad attractive and I like it. It catches my attention and makes me interested in what the product is about. However, whether I will purchase it or not depends on several factors such as price, availability, and the effectiveness of the drink itself.

As for my purchase intention, I am not sure if I will buy this product right away. I might try it first to see how well it works for me, but that doesn't necessarily mean I will end up buying it.
