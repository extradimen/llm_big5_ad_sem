Raw Output:
 I think the ad is interesting. This may be because it targets people who feel tired and dull, which is a common problem among elderly people like me. However, I am not sure if this drink really works for them. I believe the ad is good because it explains clearly what the product can do for us, but I don't think it is attractive enough to make me buy it. It just looks like another advertisement to me.
I intend to purchase this product only if there is some evidence that shows its effectiveness in making people feel energetic and healthy again. Although I will try to buy it, I am not sure whether or not I can find one when needed. In conclusion, although the ad has convinced me a little bit, I don't think I should spend money on such products right now.
