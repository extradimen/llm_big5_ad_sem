Raw Output:
  The ad is very simple and doesn't contain any information about the product. It also uses emotional manipulation by suggesting that the drink can make you feel better when tired or dull. However, it doesn't provide any evidence to support these claims. Therefore, I do not like the ad because it seems unethical and manipulative.

The ad does not resonate with me as a consumer because I am already aware of how important it is to stay hydrated throughout the day. Moreover, I feel that the message in this advertisement could be confusing for people who might think they need such a drink even if they are not feeling tired or dull. In addition, I believe that drinking too much soda can lead to health problems such as obesity and diabetes which are worse than being slightly tired or looking dull sometimes.

As far as purchase intention goes, since the ad doesn't convince me at all to buy its product, my answer would be "I do not intend to purchase this product".
