 Here is my evaluation of the ad:

The advertisement is a prevention type ad. It's interesting and catches my attention. However, I find it somewhat manipulative as it suggests that without this drink you may feel tired and look dull. This might make me feel obligated to buy the product rather than really want to. 

As for my purchase intention, I will try to buy this product because I am interested in trying new things and I could see myself enjoying this drink. But I won't definitely purchase it as I think there are other options out there that could also give me the same benefits.
