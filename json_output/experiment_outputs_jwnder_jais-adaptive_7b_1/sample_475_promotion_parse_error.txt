Raw Output:
 The ad is not persuasive to me. I do not like the way it presents itself as an energy drink that will make you look your best every day. It seems very manipulative and not genuine at all. I am also concerned about the possible health effects of drinking such a product. Therefore, I would give this ad a low score.

As for my purchase intention, I do not intend to buy this product. Even though it is marketed as an energy booster, I believe there are better ways to stay energized without consuming unnecessary chemicals or artificial additives. So, the answer here is "I will consider buying this product."

Overall, while I understand that ads need to be creative and engaging, I think they should also be honest and transparent about what they are selling. This drink seems like it might have some potentially negative side effects or risks associated with it, and therefore I would recommend avoiding it altogether.
