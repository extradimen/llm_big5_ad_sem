**Explanation:**
1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - **Like**: Neutral appeal as it's attention-grabbing but not overly persuasive.
   - **Interesting**: Slightly interesting due to its bold health claim, sparking some curiosity.
   - **Good**: Below average because it lacks strong evidence or emotional connection needed for a compelling ad.
   - **Attractive**: Moderately attractive, yet falls short of making a significant impact.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly disagree; the current appeal doesn't drive immediate purchase intent.
   - **Try to Buy**: Disagree—while it might not be outright dismissed, there's no strong motivation to act on impulse.
   - **Consider Buying**: Neutral—if other factors (like personal needs or additional reviews) come into play, you might consider giving it a try. 

Overall, while the ad grabs attention initially, its lack of compelling evidence and emotional resonance prevent me from having high purchase intent based solely on this advertisement. Additional information or experiences would likely be necessary to change that stance.
