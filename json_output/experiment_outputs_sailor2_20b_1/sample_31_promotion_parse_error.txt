  "purchase_intention_scores": [
    2 (Intend) - While I resonate, immediate purchase intent is low due to budget constraints and other priorities,
    4 (Try) - Curiosity will likely lead me to try it, but not a first-time buy commitment.
    5 (Consider) - Long-term consideration as part of my wellness routine if positive experiences arise from trial.

**Evaluation Summary:**
- **Attitude:** Generally favorable due to personal traits like talkativeness and thoroughness, finding value in the energy and appearance benefits. However, slight neutrality on attractiveness indicates not solely driven by aesthetics.
- **Purchase Intention:** Lower immediate intent (score of 2) because current priorities take precedence; moderate willingness to try (4); high consideration for future purchase if effective (5). 

This balanced yet critical approach reflects my personality while acknowledging practical financial and lifestyle considerations.
