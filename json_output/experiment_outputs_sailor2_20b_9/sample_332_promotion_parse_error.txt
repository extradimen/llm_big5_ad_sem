   - **Like:** Strongly Disagree, given my reserved nature and slight preference for more practical appeals.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral, since it's not particularly captivating but straightforward in its messaging.
   - **Good:** Agree, because of the balanced mix of functional benefits (energized) and aesthetic appeal ("look your best"), resonating with a sensible outlook on daily life needs.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Agree due to an emphasis on practicality and self-improvement which aligns well with my values.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Agree, as the product's benefits fit into my balanced lifestyle focus (though not a priority).
