**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **Like (neutral):** Being a reserved individual, while not strongly opposed, I don't find the ad overly engaging or exciting.
   - **Interesting (agree):** The message about staying energized aligns with my daily needs, making it somewhat interesting.
   - **Good (strongly agree):** It resonates positively as maintaining energy and appearance is a practical concern for me; thus, I consider this advertisement well-made.
   - **Attractive (agree):** While not exceptionally captivating, the ad's emphasis on functionality makes it attractive to someone who values practicality.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend:** Although neutral in liking and slightly interested, there isn't a strong drive yet; hence, 3 out of 7.
   - **Try:** Given my practical nature (helpful & thorough when required), I might give it a chance to see if it meets expectationsâ€”hence, moderately inclined at 4.
   - **Consider:** The benefits align with self-care goals, making me open-minded and willing to consider purchasing this product, scoring a 5.

In summary, while the ad is appealing in its practicality, my reserved nature along with slight hesitation towards immediate commitment result in moderate scores for intent. However, I am still considering it due to real-life relevance.
