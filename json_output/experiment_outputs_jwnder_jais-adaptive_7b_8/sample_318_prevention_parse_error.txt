Raw Output:
 Here's a sample response to the prompt, using the JSON format specified:\n{ \n  "ad_type" : "prevention",\n  "ad_attitude_scores" : [4,5,6,7],\n  "purchase_intention_scores" : [3,2,1] \n}\nIn this example, the score for ad type is 4 (interesting) because the user thinks that the ad is interesting. The scores for attitude are evenly distributed between like, interesting and good, with each receiving a score of 5. The purchase intention score of 3 indicates that although the user thinks the ad is good, they have no plans to buy the product.
