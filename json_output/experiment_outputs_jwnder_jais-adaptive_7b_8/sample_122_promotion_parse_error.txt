 Here is an example of how you can respond to the questions:

The ad is about a drink that helps people stay energized and look their best. The product seems like it would be beneficial for those who want to feel more energetic and attractive, which could include many different types of consumers. However, I am not sure if this particular drink really offers any unique benefits compared to other energy drinks on the market. Additionally, I find the ad somewhat manipulative because it suggests that consuming the product will automatically make people look their best without mentioning any specific ingredients or claims about how the product works.

As for my attitude towards the ad, I think it is interesting and attractive, but not good or believable. Overall, while I would consider buying this drink if I were interested in trying something new, I do not currently intend to purchase it because there are other energy drinks on the market that I already enjoy and trust.

This is just one example of how you can respond to the questions. Remember to be honest and critical when evaluating the ad as a real person or ideal consumer.
