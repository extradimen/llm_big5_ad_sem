We are given a demographic profile and personality traits. The task is to evaluate the ad as this specific person.

First, let's understand the person:

- Chinese, Male, Age <20 (so a teenager or very young adult)
- Education: Postgraduate degree (this is unusual for someone under 20, but we'll go with it)
- Occupation: Blue-collar worker (so manual labor, but with a postgraduate degree? This is a contradiction in typical life paths, but we must accept the profile as given)
- Married (unusual for under 20, but again, we take the profile)
- Monthly income: 16,000,000–25,000,000 VND (which is about $650-$1000 USD, a decent income in Vietnam)

Personality traits (with 5-point scale, but we'll map to 7-point for scoring):

- Talkative: Agree -> so we'll assume he's somewhat talkative (but note: we have to map to 7-point for the ad evaluation, but the traits are given for understanding)
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree -> friendly and social
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree -> not reserved at all
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree -> not helpful, selfish
- Generally trusting: Strongly Agree -> very trusting
- Sometimes rude: Disagree -> not rude
- Do a thorough job: Agree -> diligent
- Make plans and follow through: Disagree -> not organized, impulsive?
- Tend to be careless: Strongly Disagree -> careful
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree -> very anxious
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Neutral (so sometimes stable, sometimes not)
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree -> not imaginative
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Few artistic interests: Disagree -> so he has some artistic interests

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

We have to score:

Ad attitude (4 items):
1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Purchase intention (3 items):
1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

Scale: 1-7 (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

As this person:

- He is a young (under 20) married blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree (which is odd, but we go with it). He has a decent income for Vietnam (16-25 million VND/month). 
- Personality: 
  - He is outgoing and talkative (so social) but also very trusting (Strongly Agree) and gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree). 
  - He is not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree) and not rude (Disagree). 
  - He does a thorough job (Agree) but doesn't make plans (Disagree) and is not careless (Strongly Disagree). 
  - He has some artistic interests (Disagree on "few artistic interests") but no active imagination (Strongly Disagree) and neutral on being original.

Considering the ad: It's a drink that claims to help stay energized and look your best.

As a blue-collar worker (manual labor), staying energized might be appealing because his job is physically demanding. However, he is under 20 and married, so he might be focused on providing for his family. The income is decent, so he can afford it.

But note: 
- He is very trusting (Strongly Agree) so he might believe the ad easily.
- However, he gets nervous easily and worries a lot (Neutral, but Strongly Agree on nervous) so he might be anxious about health and appearance? The ad says "look your best", which might appeal to his anxiety about appearance? But note: he has some artistic interests (so maybe cares about appearance) but not imaginative.

But also, he is selfish (Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish) so he might care about himself. However, the ad is about personal benefit (energized and look best) so that might align.

However, the ad is very vague. It doesn't specify what the drink is, how it works, or any evidence. As someone who does a thorough job (Agree) and is not careless (Strongly Disagree), he might be skeptical of such a vague claim? But he is very trusting (Strongly Agree) so maybe he takes it at face value.

But note: he is a young person with a postgraduate degree (so educated) but in a blue-collar job. He might be critical because of his education? However, the personality says he doesn't make plans and is not imaginative, but he is careful.

Also, he is outgoing and sociable, so he might be influenced by social aspects, but the ad doesn't have any social element.

Let's break down:

Ad attitude:
1. I like the ad.
   - He might like it because it promises energy (which he needs for work) and looking good (which might matter to him as a young married man). But the ad is very generic. Since he is trusting, he might like it. However, he is also anxious and might worry about whether it's true. But the ad doesn't give details so it might not soothe his anxiety. Given his traits, I think he might be somewhat positive because of the promise, but not extremely. Let's say 5 (Agree) but not 7 because it's too vague? However, he is very trusting so maybe 6? But he is also careful and does a thorough job, so he might be critical. 

But note: he is not rude, but he is selfish. The ad is self-focused, so that might appeal. However, the ad is very simple and might not capture his interest because he has some artistic interests (so maybe he likes more creative ads) but he has no active imagination and is neutral on originality. So a plain text ad might not be exciting.

Given the contradictions, let's think:

- He is very trusting -> more likely to believe and like the ad.
- But he is anxious and worries -> might be skeptical? However, the ad promises to help with energy and appearance, which might reduce anxiety? But without evidence, it might not.

Actually, because he is very trusting, he might not be skeptical. So he might like the ad.

But the ad is very short and plain. He has some artistic interests (Disagree on "few artistic interests") so he might appreciate aesthetics. But the ad as described is just text. So if it's a plain text ad, it might not be attractive to him. However, we don't know the creative execution. The problem says: "you are shown the following advertisement: [text]". So we assume it's just that text, maybe in a simple format.

As someone with artistic interests, he might find a plain text ad boring. So:

- Like the ad: He might like the message but not the execution. Since he is trusting, the message might appeal, but the lack of creativity might turn him off. Score: 4 (neutral) or 5? But note: he is outgoing and sociable, so he might not care about the ad's creativity as much? 

Wait, personality: 
- Few artistic interests: Disagree -> so he has many artistic interests? Actually, "Disagree" with "I have few artistic interests" means he does not have few, so he has many. So he probably values art and creativity.

Therefore, a plain text ad might not be appealing to him. So:

1. I like the ad: He might like the promise but dislike the lack of creativity. Overall, maybe 4 (neutral) or 5? But he is very trusting so the promise might outweigh. However, he is also anxious and might worry about false claims. 

Given the complexity, let's assign:

- Ad is interesting: 3 (disagree) because it's too vague and plain, and he has artistic interests so he might expect more.
- Ad is good: 4 (neutral) - it's a good message but poorly executed?
- Ad is attractive: 3 (disagree) because without creative elements, it's not attractive to someone with artistic interests.

But wait, the ad might be in a nice visual ad? The problem doesn't specify. We are only given the text. So we have to assume the ad is just that sentence, perhaps in a standard font. So for someone with artistic interests, it's not attractive.

However, he is not imaginative (Strongly Disagree) so maybe he doesn't care about creativity? But he has artistic interests, meaning he appreciates art, but he himself is not creative. So he might still like well-designed ads.

Given the contradiction in his profile (postgraduate but blue-collar, young but married), we have to focus on traits.

Let me try to simulate:

As a young, married, blue-collar worker with a decent income and a postgraduate degree (so educated), he might be looking for practical solutions. The ad promises energy for his job and looking good for his social life (he's outgoing). But the ad is too vague. 

Because he does a thorough job and is not careless, he might want more details (like ingredients, how it works, evidence). Without that, he might be skeptical despite being trusting. 

Also, he gets nervous easily and worries a lot (neutral, but Strongly Agree on nervous) so he might be concerned about side effects or if it's a scam. 

Therefore, the ad might not resonate well.

But he is very trusting, so he might believe it. However, the vagueness might trigger his anxiety.

Let's assign scores for ad attitude:

1. I like the ad: 
   - Positive because it addresses his needs (energy for work, appearance for social) but negative because of vagueness and lack of creativity. 
   - Given he is trusting, but also anxious and careful, I think he would be somewhat positive but not strongly. Maybe 4 or 5. But since he has artistic interests, the plain ad might turn him off. So 4 (neutral).

2. I think the ad is interesting: 
   - It's a common claim, not original. He has neutral on originality, but he has artistic interests so he might expect more creativity. The ad is boring. Score: 3.

3. I believe the ad is good: 
   - Good in what sense? As an ad? Or the product? The question is about the ad. The ad is poorly executed (plain text) and vague, so not good. But the message is positive. However, as an ad, it's not effective for him. Score: 3.

4. I find the ad attractive: 
   - Without visual or creative elements, and given his artistic interests, not attractive. Score: 2.

But wait, he is outgoing and sociable, so he might not care about the ad's aesthetics as much? But the trait says he has many artistic interests, so he probably does care.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He might be interested because of the energy claim (for his blue-collar job) but the ad doesn't specify what the drink is. He is careful and does a thorough job, so he would want more information. Without that, he won't intend to buy. Also, he is selfish so he cares about himself, but the ad doesn't convince him. Score: 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - He might try it if it's cheap and available, but the ad doesn't give a reason to try. Since he is trusting, he might try it once. But he is anxious and might worry about safety. Score: 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - He will consider it because the promise is relevant (energy and appearance), but he needs more info. Score: 5.

But let's cross-check with personality:

- He is very trusting -> more likely to consider.
- He gets nervous easily -> might avoid trying new things? But he is young and outgoing, so maybe not.

Given his blue-collar job, energy is important. So he might be interested.

However, the ad is too vague. He does a thorough job, so he would research more. The ad alone isn't enough to make him intend to buy, but it might spark consideration.

So:

1. Intend to purchase: 3 (he wouldn't go out of his way to buy based on this alone)
2. Try to buy: 4 (he might try it if he sees it in the store)
3. Consider buying: 5 (he would think about it, especially if he sees more info)

But note: monthly income is 16-25 million VND (about $650-$1000). In Vietnam, energy drinks are affordable (like Sting or Red Bull, which are around 10,000-20,000 VND per can). So cost is not a barrier.

However, as a careful person, he might check if it's healthy.

Given the above, let's set:

Ad attitude scores:
- like: 4 (neutral)
- interesting: 3 (disagree)
- good: 3 (disagree)
- attractive: 2 (strongly disagree)

Purchase intention:
- intend: 3
- try: 4
- consider: 5

But wait, he is very trusting (Strongly Agree) so he might believe the ad and be more positive. However, the ad is so minimal that even a trusting person might find it lacking.

Also, he is not helpful/unselfish (selfish) so the self-benefit message should appeal. But the ad doesn't provide enough to overcome the vagueness.

Another angle: as a young person (under 20) and married, he might be under pressure to provide. Energy for work is crucial. So the ad might resonate on that point. But again, without details, it's weak.

Given his anxiety (gets nervous easily), he might be drawn to solutions for anxiety, but the ad doesn't address anxiety. It says "energized" which might actually increase anxiety? So that could be a negative.

Therefore, the ad might not be appealing because "energized" might make him more nervous.

So:

- The ad promises energy, but as someone who gets nervous easily, too much energy might be bad. So he might be put off.

Thus, ad attitude might be negative.

Let me adjust:

Ad attitude:
1. I like the ad: 3 (he doesn't like that it might make him more nervous)
2. I think the ad is interesting: 2 (boring and potentially harmful for his anxiety)
3. I believe the ad is good: 2 (it's not good because it could worsen his anxiety)
4. I find the ad attractive: 2 (same reason)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 2 (he won't intend to buy something that might make him more nervous)
2. Try to buy: 3 (he might try a small amount to see, but hesitant)
3. Consider buying: 3 (he would consider, but with caution)

But note: the ad says "stay energized", which for a blue-collar worker might be necessary. And "look your best" might appeal to his social side (he's outgoing). However, the anxiety point is strong.

Also, he worries a lot (Neutral), so he might worry about the effects.

Given that he is very trusting, he might believe the ad and think it will help without side effects. But his personality trait of getting nervous easily might make him avoid stimulants.

In reality, many energy drinks contain caffeine which can increase anxiety. So as an anxious person, he might avoid them.

Therefore, the ad might backfire.

So scores:

Ad attitude:
- like: 2 (strongly disagree)
- interesting: 2
- good: 2
- attractive: 2

Purchase intention:
- intend: 1 (strongly disagree)
- try: 2
- consider: 3

But wait, he is a blue-collar worker doing manual labor. He might need energy to get through the day. So even if he is anxious, he might still consider it because the job demands it.

For example, many workers drink coffee or energy drinks despite anxiety.

So it's a trade-off.

Given that, purchase intention might be higher.

Let me think of a typical profile: an anxious person who needs energy for work might still use energy drinks but in moderation.

So the ad might resonate, but he would look for a product that doesn't worsen anxiety (like low caffeine).

But the ad doesn't specify, so he would be cautious.

Thus:

Ad attitude: 
- The ad is too vague and doesn't address his anxiety concern, so negative.

Purchase intention:
- He will consider it (score 4) because he needs energy, but he will research options.

So:

Ad attitude:
1. like: 3
2. interesting: 3
3. good: 3
4. attractive: 3

Purchase intention:
1. intend: 3
2. try: 4
3. consider: 4

But earlier I thought about artistic interests. The ad is plain text, so for someone with artistic interests, ad attitude should be lower.

Given the time, I'll go with:

Ad attitude:
- like: 3
- interesting: 2
- good: 2
- attractive: 2

Purchase intention:
- intend: 2
- try: 3
- consider: 4

Final decision:

After careful thought, the ad's vagueness and lack of creativity (given his artistic interests) make the ad poorly received. Additionally, the "energized" claim might exacerbate his anxiety, which is a core trait (Strongly Agree on gets nervous easily). Therefore, ad attitude scores are low.

For purchase intention, the relevance to his job (energy for blue-collar work) provides some counterbalance, so consideration is moderate.

Scores:

Ad attitude:
- like: 2
- interesting: 2
- good: 2
- attractive: 1

Purchase intention:
- intend: 1
- try: 2
- consider: 3

But "attractive" 1 is too low? He might find the message attractive but not the ad. The question is "I find the ad attractive", so if the ad is plain, score 1 or 2.

Similarly, "good" for the ad: it's not good, so 2.

Let's set:

ad_attitude = [2, 2, 2, 2]  # all neutral-low

But I think attractive should be lower because of artistic interests.

Standard scale: 1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree.

So for "I find the ad attractive", if he strongly disagrees, score=1.

Given artistic interests, and plain ad, score=1.

Similarly, "I believe the ad is good" – as an ad, it's bad, so score=2 (disagree).

So:

- like: 2
- interesting: 2
- good: 2
- attractive: 1

Purchase intention:

- intend: 1 (he won't intend to buy based on this)
- try: 2 (he might not even try)
- consider: 3 (he would consider other energy products, but not necessarily this one)

But the ad doesn't specify the product, so he might consider energy drinks in general.

The ad is for a specific product? The text doesn't say. We assume it's for a product.

In context, the ad is for some energy product.

So he would consider energy products, but this ad doesn't convince him of this particular product.

So consider buying this product: 3.

Final scores:

ad_attitude = [2, 2, 2, 1]
purchase_intention = [1, 2, 3]

But let's see if there's a better fit.

Another approach: use the traits to weight.

- Very trusting: + for belief in claim
- Gets nervous easily: - for energy claim
- Artistic interests: - for plain ad
- Outgoing: + for appearance claim
- Blue-collar worker: + for energy claim

Net for ad attitude: the ad execution is bad (artistic interests), and the energy claim is double-edged (needed for work but worsens anxiety). So overall negative.

For purchase, he might consider energy products but not based on this ad alone.

So I think [2,2,2,1] and [1,2,3] is reasonable.

But let's check the scale. The problem doesn't specify the scale, but in such contexts, it's usually 1-5 with 3 neutral.

So:

ad_attitude: 
- like: 2 (disagree)
- interesting: 2
- good: 2
- attractive: 1 (strongly disagree)

purchase_intention:
- intend: 1 (strongly disagree)
- try: 2 (disagree)
- consider: 3 (neutral)

Yes.

So the list for ad_attitude is [2,2,2,1]
purchase_intention is [1,2,3]

In the response, it should be a list of 4 for ad attitude and 3 for purchase intention.

So:

[2, 2, 2, 1] for ad attitude
[1, 2, 3] for purchase intention

But let's confirm the order.

The problem says for ad attitude: "like the ad", "ad is interesting", "ad is good", "ad is attractive"

For purchase intention: "intend to purchase", "try to buy", "consider buying"

Yes.

So final answer.
