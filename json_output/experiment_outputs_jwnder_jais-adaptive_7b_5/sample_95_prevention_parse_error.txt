Given that this is an advertisement for a drink claiming to prevent tiredness and dullness, it would be reasonable to assume that the target audience is likely young adults or individuals who lead busy lives with little time for rest. The ad appeals to their desire to look and feel their best at all times, despite their hectic schedules.

The "ad type" of this advertisement is "prevention". This suggests that the product is designed to prevent negative outcomes or states (in this case, feeling tired and dull). Prevention-focused ads tend to resonate with consumers who are proactive in maintaining their health and wellbeing. 

The "ad attitude scores" would likely be high for someone who is a talkative individual, outgoing, helpful, unselfish, trusting, and emotionally stable. These traits align with the message of the ad, which encourages consumers to take proactive measures to prevent feeling tired and dull. 

As for the "purchase intention scores", it would depend on the individual's specific circumstances. If the product is affordable and easily accessible, someone who values their wellbeing and has a busy lifestyle might consider purchasing it. However, if the cost of the product is too high or they already have sufficient sources of energy, they may not be as inclined to buy it.

Therefore, based on the provided information, an ideal consumer for this ad would likely be someone who is young, busy, health-conscious, and prefers to take proactive measures to maintain their wellbeing.
