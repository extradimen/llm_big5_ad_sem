Parse Error: 'list' object is not a mapping

Raw Output:
 The given advertisement is not very persuasive. It does not seem to have any direct connection with the product being marketed and the problems that it claims to solve. Therefore, I would score the overall ad as follows: 

- Ad type = prevention, attitude scores = [3, 4, 2, 1]
- Purchase intention scores = [2, 3, 1]
