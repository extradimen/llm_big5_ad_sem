Raw Output:
 The ad is about a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best. As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, I can see why this might appeal to me. However, I'm not sure how much of an effect it would have on my energy levels or appearance. In general, the ad seems kind of generic and doesn't give me any reason to believe that it's better than other similar products out there. It also makes some claims without providing evidence (e.g., "This drink helps you stay energized"). Therefore, I would rate the overall effectiveness of this ad as 3/7 on a scale from 1-7 with 7 being very effective and 1 being not at all effective.
