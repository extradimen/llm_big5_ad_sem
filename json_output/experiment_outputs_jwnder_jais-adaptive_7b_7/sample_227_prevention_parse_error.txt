 I am sorry but as an AI model, I do not have the ability to view or analyze advertisements. However, here is a general outline of how you might evaluate this ad based on the questions provided:\n 

Firstly, you can evaluate the **attitude toward the advertisement** by considering the ad's impact and relevance. For instance, does it effectively communicate its message? Does it evoke emotions or make a connection with the audience in some way? You might also consider whether the product is portrayed in an honest and appealing manner.\n 

Next, you can evaluate your **purchase intention** by assessing how compelling the ad is to you personally. This would involve considering factors such as the product's relevance to your needs or interests, the perceived value of the product, any potential risks or drawbacks associated with purchasing it, and whether you trust the advertiser.\n 

Keep in mind that these are just examples of possible responses, and you can choose scores that best reflect your personal opinions and experiences.
