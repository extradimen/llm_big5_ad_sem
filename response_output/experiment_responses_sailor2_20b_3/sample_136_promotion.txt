**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**:  
  - *Like*: Neutral because while the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, it's not a deal-breaker for me personally.
  - *Interesting*: Agree due to the clear benefits highlighted in energy levels and appearance, making it engaging content. 
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree since the ad effectively communicates its key value propositions which align with general wellness aspirations.
  - *Attractive*: Agree as the messaging is both visually and conceptually attractive, resonating well without being overly pushy.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:  
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Neutral. While I appreciate the benefits, it doesn't spur immediate actionâ€”other factors like price or personal needs might sway my decision.
  - *Try to Buy*: Disagree; there's not enough urgency or compelling reason for an impulse buy in this ad alone.
  - *Consider Buying*: Strongly Agree; these attributes are significant, so I would definitely keep it on the radar and consider purchasing if circumstances align (e.g., during periods needing extra energy).

Overall, while the advertisement is solid and well-presented, my purchase intent falls more towards thoughtful consideration rather than immediate action.
