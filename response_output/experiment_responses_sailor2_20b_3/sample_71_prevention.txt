**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (Score: 3)**: The ad is somewhat engaging but doesn't strongly connect with my personal values or interests.
  - **Interesting (Score: 2)**: I find it mildly interesting due to the implied benefits, but it lacks creativity and emotional depth for me.
  - **Good (Score: 3)**: It conveys a clear message about its effectiveness against tiredness and dull appearance, which is acceptable but not exceptional. 
  - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: The ad has some attractiveness due to the problem it addresses, but I am reserved by nature and don't find it overly compelling.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
  - **Intend (Score: 5)**: While I appreciate its relevance, my generally unselfish and cautious approach means I'm open to trying products that address fatigue, but I wonâ€™t be rushing.
  - **Try (Score: 6)**: There's a high likelihood of giving it a try based on the perceived benefits if there is reasonable pricing or an introductory offer.
  - **Consider (Score: 5)**: The ad definitely nudges me toward considering the purchase, especially if matched with other positive experiences like reviews from trusted sources. 

In summary, while I have some reservations and find the ad somewhat effective but not highly persuasive, it still motivates a cautious yet open mindset towards potential purchase.
