**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 5):**
   - Although I value staying energized and looking good, the ad doesn't resonate strongly with me because it lacks specificity in its claims.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 6):**
   - The premise of "energizing" and "looking best" appeals to everyday wellness goals, so I find some interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 4):**
   - It’s straightforward but lacks compelling evidence or unique selling points that would make it exceptional in a saturated market.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 3):**
   - While visually appealing and aspirational, the messaging feels generic; not enough to be truly eye-catching.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):**
   - The lack of detailed benefits or trust-building elements reduces my immediate intent.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 3):**
   - There's a mild interest but not enough urgency or confidence in the ad’s claims to make an active effort.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 2):**
   - It falls into consideration, meaning I might look for more information if prompted by another source before making a decision.

In summary:
- The **ad's attitude** is moderately positive due to its basic appeal but lacks depth and personal resonance.
- **Purchase intention** remains low because the ad fails to inspire strong confidence or unique value compared to competitors. Further details would be needed for more substantial consideration.
