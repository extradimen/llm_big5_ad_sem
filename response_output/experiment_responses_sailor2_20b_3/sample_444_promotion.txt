**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**  
  - **Like (score=3):** The slogan sounds appealing and can resonate with my desire to feel energetic, but it feels somewhat generic.
  - **Interesting (score=4):** It sparks a mild interest, especially since staying energized is important. However, there are many similar products on the market, reducing novelty for me.
  - **Good (score=5):** I view this ad as decent; it’s well-crafted and promises tangible benefits. My skeptical nature keeps expectations moderate.
  - **Attractive (score=2):** Although visually appealing ads might catch attention, the current one doesn't strongly attract me due to personal preference for more compelling visuals.

- **Purchase intention:**  
  - **Intend (score=1):** Despite liking the message, my actual intent to buy is low. I'm cautious about new products and prefer established brands.
  - **Try (score=2):** Slight willingness to try, especially considering it promises energy—useful for work as a manager—but not enough confidence to invest without further reassurance.
  - **Consider (score=3):** This product is on the radar; I might think about it when needing an energizing boost. My tendency towards practicality makes me open but cautious.

In summary, while the ad appeals moderately and raises interest due to its promise of energy benefits, my personal traits like skepticism, financial constraints, and past experiences shape a more reserved approach to purchasing this product outright.
