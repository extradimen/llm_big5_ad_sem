**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it's not compelling but has some appeal.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - Slightly agree; energy and appearance are universal themes, so it holds mild interest.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Agree; promises well-being benefits that many can relate to, making it somewhat effective in messaging.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; my reserved nature and lack of strong emotional reaction make it less visually appealing or engaging.

### Purchase Intentions:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree; while benefits are noted, current financial constraints (income < 15 million VND) affect the decision.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; immediate plans and budget limitations make it unlikely I would attempt a purchase right now.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree; although not an imminent priority, the benefits might be considered for future needs or if circumstances change.

Overall, while acknowledging its positive message, my cautious nature, financial limits, and reserved demeanor lead to moderate appeal without strong intent to purchase immediately.
