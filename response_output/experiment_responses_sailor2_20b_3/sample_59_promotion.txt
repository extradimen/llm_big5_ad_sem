**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
    - **Like:** Neutral (3) — The ad doesn’t particularly appeal to me due to its generic nature and broad claims.
    - **Interesting:** Moderately Agree (4) — It sparks a bit of interest since staying energized is relevant, but it's nothing groundbreaking for someone in my demographic.
    - **Good:** Somewhat Agree (5) — The ad seems decently crafted with positive messaging, though not outstanding.
    - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — Lack personalization and specificity makes the appeal weak.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) — Given my low income and focus on basic needs over extras, I wouldn’t prioritize this product.
    - **Try to Buy:** Neutral Tendency Towards Agree (2) — There's a slight curiosity but no urgency or financial means justify an immediate purchase.
    - **Consider Buying:** Somewhat Considerable (3) — Might think about it when budget allows, mainly due to the health and appearance benefits.

Overall, while not entirely negative, this ad doesn't strongly resonate with my values, lifestyle, or current economic constraints. Thus, I lean towards lower scores in both attitudes toward the advertisement and purchase intention.
