**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) — Neutral; I appreciate its straightforward message but it doesn't evoke strong emotions.
    - *It's interesting.* (Score: 4) — Agree, it addresses common concerns about energy and appearance effectively.
    - *Believes the ad is good.* (Score: 5) — Agree, as a civil servant, I value clear communication of benefits, though not overly persuasive for me personally.
    - *Find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) — Disagree slightly; it feels somewhat generic without strong emotional appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1) — Strongly Disagree; my cautious nature and moderate income make me reluctant.
    - *Will try to buy the product.* (Score: 2) — Slightly Agree, might consider it during a low-energy period but not regularly.
    - *Consider buying this product.* (Score: 3) — Neutral, I acknowledge potential benefits for energy but other factors like budget and routine take precedence.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional utility, the advertisement falls short in resonating deeply with my personality traits. It lacks emotional engagement and isn't a top priority given my financial constraints. Thus, it's more of a cautious "consider" rather than an immediate purchase decision.
