**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **Like:** *5* — Neutral leaning towards positive because I appreciate its attempt to address common daily issues.
  - **Interesting:** *4* — It catches my attention but not enough to be truly compelling due to overused health-related claims.
  - **Good:** *3* — The message is generic and lacks unique or persuasive elements, so it falls short of being impressive.
  - **Attractive:** *2* — I find the ad somewhat unappealing because its messaging feels overly promotional without sufficient emotional appeal.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** *3* — The ad does raise awareness, but it’s not strong enough for me to act on immediate purchase intent.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** *2* — There's slight curiosity due to the potential benefit, yet hesitation from skepticism about effectiveness.
  - **Will consider buying this product:** *1* — The consideration is minimal; I may research further but won’t prioritize it over my existing routines or other needs.

In summary, while acknowledging its attempt at addressing common fatigue issues, the ad's execution feels standard and lacks a strong personal connection. My personality traits (helpfulness, originality) align well with considering health solutions, yet emotional stability concerns prevent high engagement levels, leading to low purchase intention scores.
