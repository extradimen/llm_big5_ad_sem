**Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** 
   - *Score: 4 (Neutral)*
     - As a student with balanced traits towards talkativeness and thoroughness but slightly nervous and worried about appearance-related aspects, I find it somewhat appealing for its energy-boosting claim.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**
   - *Score: 3 (Disagree)*
     - While energizing drinks are relevant, my tendency to be reserved and not overly sociable means I don't find the advertisement particularly engaging or intriguing.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** 
   - *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)*
     - The claim of "look your best every day" feels superficial; it lacks a deeper connection, especially given my neutral stance on artistic interests and originality.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 
   - *Score: 5 (Agree)**
     - It appeals to practical needs like staying energized, which resonates with balancing academic demands and maintaining focus.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 
   - *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
     - Despite the appeal of its benefits, my budget constraints (>$46,000,000 VND) and preference for cost-effective solutions make immediate purchase unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** 
   - *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
     - With a strong focus on being thorough in my choices and not feeling driven by the ad's attractiveness, trying it out without significant need isn't compelling.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** 
   - *Score: 2 (Neutral)**
     - There is some mild consideration due to practical utility; however, external factors like budget constraints heavily influence my hesitation.

Overall, while I acknowledge the drink's potential benefits, the ad does not sufficiently resonate with me emotionally or make a compelling case for immediate action. It lands on neutral-to-negative territory in terms of persuasion and intent, despite acknowledging its functional appeal.
