**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad (score = 3):**
   - *Neutral*: As a reserved person with occasional nervousness, I find the emotional appeal to feel tired or look dull somewhat relatable but not enough to truly enjoy the ad.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
   - *Mildly Agree*: The concept of feeling more energized and looking better appeals mildly due to my generally trusting nature, yet it doesn't captivate me strongly.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5):**
   - *Somewhat Agree*: It presents a clear message but lacks compelling storytelling or creative flair, which isn’t aligned with my strong imagination preference.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):**
   - *Disagree*: Given my reserved nature and emotional stability concerns, I'm not drawn to its straightforward presentation; it feels somewhat manipulative rather than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):**
   - *Strongly Disagree*: My cautious and thorough attitude means I don't immediately feel convinced by the ad alone without further proof or personal experience.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
   - *Disagree*: Though mildly curious, my low score indicates hesitation; practicality and past experiences influence me more than a single persuasive message.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):**
   - *Neutral* but leaning toward "Consider": There’s enough baseline interest to keep it on the radar if I see other positive reviews or endorsements, balancing my trust with careful consideration before making a purchase decision.

In summary, while the ad isn't outright unappealing due to its clear messaging and relevance, it falls short in engaging me deeply given my personality traits. A balanced mix of reassurance through personal experiences and creativity could potentially enhance both attitude toward the ad and my willingness to buy.
