**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like the Ad**: Neutral (3). Given my reserved nature, while not strongly against it, I find it somewhat engaging but don't feel a strong personal connection yet.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4). The energetic and appearance benefits appeal to me, making it an interesting proposition.
   - **Good Advertisement**: Strongly Agree (5). It's well-constructed with clear health/performance claims that resonate positively with my values of maintaining good looks and stamina.
   - **Attractive**: Neutral (3). While not unappealing, the ad’s visual appeal does not immediately captivate me deeply.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree (2). Despite liking aspects of the product's benefits, my current financial situation and cautious nature mean I'm not committing fully.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Agree (4). Given its strong claims and a bit of curiosity, there’s enough incentive for me to give it a try when I have budget flexibility.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree (5). The ad effectively makes the product seem worthwhile enough that I definitely plan to include it in future considerations once appropriate circumstances arise.

Overall, while not completely swayed by the advertisement due to my reserved and cautious tendencies, there’s substantial interest and a high likelihood of making a purchase if conditions align.
