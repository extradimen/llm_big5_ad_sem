**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**  
   - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; resonates because I value social appearances and staying energetic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
   - Mildly agree, as it presents a clear problem-solution scenario, which can be engaging for someone aware of physical appearance.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**  
   - Disagree; lacks strong credibility or compelling evidence to trust its claims without concrete details.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**  
   - Strongly disagree, as it feels manipulative and generic rather than genuinely appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**  
   - Slightly agree; there's some interest in its potential benefits but not enough conviction due to budget constraints and skepticism about the effectiveness.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**  
   - Strongly disagree; lack of urgency or desire to invest given limited income and preference for more reliable solutions.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**  
   - Mild agreement; though unlikely, the message may be noted for future consideration if circumstances change or additional evidence is provided.

In summary, while there's some mild interest due to sociable tendencies and a desire to stay energized, overall skepticism towards the adâ€™s effectiveness combined with financial constraints leads to lower intent to purchase. The score reflects careful consideration without strong commitment.
