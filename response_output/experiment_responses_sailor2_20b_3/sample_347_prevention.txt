**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - The ad is somewhat appealing but doesn't resonate strongly with my reserved nature.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - It piques curiosity due to the mention of fatigue and appearance, but it’s not particularly captivating.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - I find its message clear and relevant for maintaining personal well-being, though it could be more persuasive.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - The ad lacks a compelling visual or emotional hook that would make me strongly drawn to it.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; the current score doesn't generate enough motivation for immediate action.
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral; might consider giving it a shot if convenience allows, but there’s no strong urgency.
3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Agree slightly; the message nudges me towards thinking about potential benefits without compelling enough to act swiftly.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's focus on wellness concerns and reliability in messaging ("do a thorough job"), its lack of emotional engagement and personal relevance means it doesn't drive strong purchase intent for someone with my background. Nevertheless, it remains in consideration given its alignment with health consciousness.
