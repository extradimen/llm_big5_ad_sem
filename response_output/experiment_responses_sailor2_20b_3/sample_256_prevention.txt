**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**  
   The message is clear but feels somewhat overplayed given my reserved nature and tendency to get nervous easily.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
   It's not highly engaging, but it addresses common concerns about energy levels which resonates slightly.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**  
   While truthful in presenting a possible outcome without the product, I'm more skeptical of health claims and prefer scientific evidence.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**  
   The design might be acceptable but doesn't capture my attention strongly due to personal preferences for credibility over emotional appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**  
   Neutral leaning towards cautious as I have reservations about marketing hype and would seek reviews first.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**  
   Willingness to consider a trial if backed by positive feedback or personal recommendations, but not immediately driven by the ad alone.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**  
   Low consideration due to my generally cautious approach and lack of strong emotional connection with the advertisement's message.

In summary, while the ad is functional in conveying its point, it doesn't strongly persuade me given my reserved personality, skepticism, and desire for credible information. Therefore, I have a moderately positive but cautious response overall.
