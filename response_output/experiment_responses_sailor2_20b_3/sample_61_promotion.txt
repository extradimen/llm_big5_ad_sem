**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 4)**: While I appreciate well-crafted ads, this one doesn't strongly appeal to me due to its broad claims.
- **Interesting (Score: 3)**: The concept of staying energized and looking good is generic; it lacks specific details or unique features that spark interest.
- **Good (Score: 2)**: The ad's message feels too general, making it hard for me to trust the product genuinely delivers on its promises. It seems more like marketing rhetoric than solid evidence.
- **Attractive (Score: 5)**: Visually and tone-wise, I find the advertisement moderately appealing but not enough to convince strongly.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (Score: 1)**: Given my reserved nature and skepticism towards such vague claims, there's no strong intention to buy.
- **Try (Score: 2)**: While curiosity might lead me to consider trying it once, the lack of compelling evidence reduces confidence in making an immediate purchase decision.
- **Consider (Score: 3)**: I'll ponder over this option if other factors like reviews or special offers come into play. However, my default stance leans towards caution rather than enthusiasm.

Overall, while not entirely dismissive, the ad falls short on personal resonance and reliability, impacting both attitude and intention to purchase negatively.
