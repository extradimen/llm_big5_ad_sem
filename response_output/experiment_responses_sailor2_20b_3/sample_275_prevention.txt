**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score 3) - While I appreciate its straightforwardness, it doesn't evoke strong positive emotions given my personality.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score 4) - It piques curiosity by addressing a common feeling of fatigue and dull appearance, making me pay attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Disagree (Score 2) - The claim seems slightly exaggerated; I need more evidence or trust in the brand's credibility to fully agree it’s "good."
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral (Score 3) - It resonates enough for mild interest, but not strong attraction due to its simplicity.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Agree (Score 5) - The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking better is appealing, aligning with my need for energy.
2. **Will try to buy the product**: Strongly Agree (Score 6) - Given its potential benefits, I am inclined to give it a trial based on both personal motivation and trust in preventive measures.
3. **Consider buying this product**: Agree (Score 5) – Although not an immediate purchase decision due to my cautious nature, there's strong consideration as the ad addresses real concerns.

Overall, while not overly impressed by the advertisement itself, its direct message about improving energy levels makes me willing to give it a try, balancing curiosity with practicality.
