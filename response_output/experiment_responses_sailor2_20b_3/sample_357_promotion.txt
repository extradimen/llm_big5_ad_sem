**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad:** *Score = 4*  
  While I appreciate a product aimed at energy and appearance enhancement, it feels somewhat generic. As someone who values thoroughness (Neutral) but not overly imaginative products (Strongly Disagree), this message doesn’t uniquely appeal to me.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 3*  
  The promise of staying energized is appealing, yet the claim "look your best every day" feels too broad and lacks specific details. It’s mildly intriguing but not compelling enough given my cautious nature (Strongly Agree in being generally trusting).

- **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 2*  
  The message aligns with common wellness goals, which can be beneficial. However, it doesn’t excite or inspire me strongly; I need more evidence of effectiveness and credibility.

- **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 2*  
  There’s a lack of visual appeal or emotional connection that would draw me in as an outgoing individual (Strongly Disagree). The overall presentation is neutral at best.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 1*  
  Despite my occasional need for energy boosters, I have reservations about its effectiveness. Given my monthly income and cautious nature, the low score reflects a strong reluctance without further validation or personal experience.

- **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 1*  
  Low intention due to skepticism; I prefer trying alternatives with more solid recommendations from trusted sources rather than buying impulsively.

- **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 1*  
  Even if intrigued, my low tendency towards spontaneity (Neutral in planning) means I’ll need additional information or personal reviews before considering purchase. Hence, a very low score here as well.

Overall, the ad's generic messaging doesn’t resonate strongly with my values and cautious approach to product choices, resulting in moderate-to-low positive attitudes and negligible intention to buy.
