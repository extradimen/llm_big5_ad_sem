**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) - As a reserved individual, I don't find it particularly engaging or appealing.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) - The concept of staying energized and looking good is somewhat intriguing.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) - It presents an aspirational benefit, which resonates with wanting to improve daily well-being.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) - While not overtly negative, the ad's visual or emotional pull doesn't captivate me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Despite finding it good, my financial constraints and lack of immediate need make a firm commitment unlikely.
  - **Try to buy:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Even with the benefits highlighted, there's no compelling reason for an initial trial given current priorities.
  - **Consider buying:** Disagree (2) - While not dismissing it entirely, I'm more focused on practical necessities over premium energy drinks.

Overall, while I acknowledge its merits, personal preference and economic reality lead to a low likelihood of purchase.
