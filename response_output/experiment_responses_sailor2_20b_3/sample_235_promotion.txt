**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (4) – It doesn’t immediately evoke strong feelings, but I can tolerate it.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree (3) – The message seems generic and not unique enough to grab my attention.
  - **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2) – From a personal perspective, the claims are too broad and lack specific benefits that appeal directly to me.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) – It doesn't visually or emotionally attract me due to its overused energy/performance promises.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) – The ad isn’t persuasive enough, and I don’t feel any urgency.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree (1) – No compelling reasons or unique features justify trying this product.
  - **Consider Buying:** Disagree (2) – While it’s not entirely ruled out, the low engagement from the ad makes me unlikely to consider it seriously.

Given my preference for detailed and specific information, coupled with a strong focus on practicality over general promises, I find this advertisement unconvincing. Thus, both positive attitude and purchase intention are low.
