**Evaluation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement

- **I like the ad (Score: 3)**  
  The appeal is limited. Although it highlights a common issue—feeling tired and looking dull—it does not personally resonate with my cautious nature.

- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
  It's mildly intriguing, but without compelling evidence or personal relevance to my routine, it doesn't grab attention strongly enough.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**  
  The message has some merit in warning about fatigue-related impacts. However, its effectiveness feels average due to a lack of specific details and emotional connection.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**  
  It's not particularly engaging for someone who leans towards being reserved and sometimes gets nervous easily; I need more reassurance than just generic claims.

### Purchase Intention

- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**  
  Strongly disagree. The advertisement lacks the concrete benefits, trustworthiness, or personal urgency needed to prompt an immediate purchase decision.

- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**  
  Slightly agree; curiosity might lead me to research it further, but there's no compelling reason to make a spontaneous attempt at purchasing right away.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**  
  Neutral leaning towards agreement. The ad sparks mild interest that I could explore under certain conditions or if other reviews are positive, but not enough for an automatic buy-in decision.

In summary, while the advertisement hints at important concerns related to energy and appearance, its overall appeal is muted by insufficient personal relevance, lack of deep emotional connection, and absence of strong credibility. Hence, it earns modest scores without strongly influencing my immediate purchase intentions as a cautious yet helpful civil servant.
