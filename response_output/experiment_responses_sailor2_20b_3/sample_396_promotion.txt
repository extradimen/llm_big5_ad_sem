**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:**  
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): The message is appealing but not particularly engaging given my reserved nature and lack of strong emotional response.
  - It's interesting (Score: 2): While it offers a functional benefit, its presentation doesn't captivate me enough.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 4): Pragmatically, it promises energy and better appearance which might be useful, but not compelling for my lifestyle.
  - Attractive (Score: 3): It has an okay visual appeal; however, its overall allure doesn't strongly resonate with me.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): While the benefits sound plausible, they don’t align closely enough with my current needs or budget.
  - Will try to buy it (Score: 1): Given the low monthly income (<15 million VND), attempting a new expensive beverage isn't feasible right now.
  - Consider buying it (Score: 2): There's some consideration, but not high urgency due to affordability concerns and other priorities.

Overall, while there’s neutral-to-positive interest in the concept of staying energized and looking better, practicality factors heavily weigh against immediate or frequent purchase.
