**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **Like**: Neutral (5) - While I appreciate catchy marketing, it doesn’t particularly resonate with my daily concerns.
2. **Interesting**: Somewhat Agree (4) - It captures attention briefly but lacks depth for sustained interest.
3. **Good**: Agree (6) - The message is clear and straightforward; however, its impact feels minimal in terms of persuasiveness or emotional connection.
4. **Attractive**: Disagree (3) – As a blue-collar worker who values substance over glossy promises, the ad's allure doesn't align with my practical mindset.

### Purchase Intention

1. **Intend to purchase**: Strongly Disagree (2) - The advertised benefits don’t match my priorities; staying energized is not an immediate necessity.
2. **Try to buy**: Disagree (2) – Even if curious, the low likelihood of trial stems from skepticism about its real impact on appearance and energy levels.
3. **Consider buying**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Given other financial commitments, this product doesn't align with my needs or budget priorities.

In summary, while recognizing that good marketing is present, the overall appeal falls short due to a lack of personal relevance and alignment with my values as a blue-collar professional seeking tangible benefits. The ad might be engaging but ultimately does not drive purchase intent for me personally.
