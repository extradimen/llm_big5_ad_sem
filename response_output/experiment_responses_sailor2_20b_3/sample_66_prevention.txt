**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    - **I like the ad (score = 3):** The straightforward message resonates slightly but doesn't elicit strong liking.
    - **Interesting (score = 4):** It's engaging enough to catch my attention, though not exceptionally fascinating given its directness. 
    - **Good (score = 5):** While it effectively conveys the benefit of alertness and appearance improvement, I think it could be more persuasive with stronger evidence.
    - **Attractive (score = 2):** The ad's design or tone isn't particularly appealing to me; it feels somewhat manipulative in its fear-mongering.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 3):** While I understand the benefit, personal habits and health routines make an immediate buy less likely.
    - **Try to buy this product (score = 4):** There's some curiosity, but not enough motivation to actively seek it out right now.
    - **Consider buying this product (score = 5):** It is worth considering for future use if I notice fatigue or dullness issues affecting me.

Balancing these responses reflects my cautious yet open-minded approach. The ad meets a need subtly and doesn't outright reject the idea of trying, but personal trust in established routines influences my immediate purchasing behavior.
