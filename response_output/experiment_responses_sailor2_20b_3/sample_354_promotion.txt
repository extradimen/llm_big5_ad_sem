**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
   - **1. I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (score of 5). The claim about staying energized is appealing, but it lacks personal resonance.
   - **2. I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat agreeable (score of 4) since the message targets energy and appearance maintenance, both relevant for daily life.
   - **3. I believe the ad is good:** Generally positive perception (score of 6). The messaging seems straightforward and beneficial but doesn't strongly align with my personal values or priorities.
   - **4. I find the ad attractive:** Neutral leaning slightly negative (score of 3) because it feels somewhat clich√© compared to other health-focused ads.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **1. I intend to purchase this product:** Low intention (score of 2). My current budget and existing routines don't leave room for frequent energy drinks.
   - **2. I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat open-minded but cautious (score of 3). Given the neutral-to-positive assessment, there's interest in trying it out under specific conditions.
   - **3. I will consider buying this product:** Moderate consideration (score of 4). While not a high priority, if convenience or special offers arise, it might be an option.

Overall, while appreciating its benefits and finding the ad somewhat engaging, my reserved nature and current financial situation lead to moderate interest without strong immediate intent to purchase.
