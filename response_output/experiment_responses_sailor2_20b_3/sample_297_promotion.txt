**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3):** Neutral to slightly positive; the ad is pleasant but not overly compelling given my traits.
   - **Interesting (2):** Slightly disagreeable; it doesn't stand out as particularly engaging for someone who tends to be careless and nervous easily.
   - **Good (3):** Somewhat agreeable, as its claims are generally valid, though credibility isn’t a strong draw due to cautious nature.
   - **Attractive (4):** Mildly positive; aesthetically pleasing visuals might attract me despite my reservations.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (5):** Moderate agreement; the benefits resonate with wanting energy and looking good, but caution prevails due to skepticism about immediate action.
   - **Try (4):** Likely to consider giving it a trial run, influenced by its promises despite my tendency toward carelessness in decision-making.
   - **Consider (6):** High likelihood of evaluating purchase; curiosity balanced with practical concerns regarding product effectiveness.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s message and presentation, my cautious personality keeps me from being overly enthusiastic or impulsively purchasing. However, it still holds enough interest to warrant further consideration and a trial.
