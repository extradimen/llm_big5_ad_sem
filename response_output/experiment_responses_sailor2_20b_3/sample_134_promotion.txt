2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4)
   - The promise of staying energized and looking best appeals slightly, but it doesn't grab me intensely due to general neutrality in social engagement.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5)
   - Neutral leaning positive; I recognize its aim at health benefits, which aligns with my pragmatic outlook as a civil servant focusing on efficiency and well-being.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)
   - Not very appealing given my preference for straightforwardness and skepticism about marketing claims.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1 – Strongly Disagree)
   - Despite being health-conscious, I don't have a strong urge due to cautious nature and lack of immediate need.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1 – Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my generally reserved approach to new products and trust issues with marketing claims, there's no inclination to make an effort to purchase it.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3 – Neutral)
   - Although I might not be highly motivated, if the opportunity arises or after more information is available, I would weigh its benefits against alternatives in a balanced manner.
