**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
- **I like the ad. (Score = 2)**: Although I appreciate energy drinks for their practicality, my reserved and sometimes-rude nature doesn't find the generic claim very compelling.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score = 3)**: Neutral to slightly agree; it’s a common marketing pitch that doesn’t excite but isn’t off-putting either.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score = 4)**: While not groundbreaking, it conveys basic benefits clearly enough for practical consumers like me.
  
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score = 3)**: The visual and messaging might be okay but falls short of capturing my interest given my reserved nature.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score = 1)**: Strongly disagree; current daily routine isn’t lacking sufficient energy, so no immediate need.
  
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score = 1)**: Similar reluctance due to established habits and lack of perceived necessity.

- **I will consider buying this product. (Score = 2)**: Mild consideration if faced with fatigue issues or promotional offers but not a priority given my current situation and preferences.

Overall, the ad aligns somewhat with practical functionality, though its persuasive appeal falls short due to personal traits like being reserved, uninterested in new products without specific needs, and careful about making purchases. Thus, while I acknowledge its existence, actual purchase intent remains low.
