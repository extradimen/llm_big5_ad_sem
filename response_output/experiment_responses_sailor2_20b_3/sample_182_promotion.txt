**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3). The energy aspect resonates but overall appeal is middle ground.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4). Energy boost and appearance benefits are engaging.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree (2). Lacks strong emotional connection or authenticity for me.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (3). Functional appeal but not captivating enough.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral (2). Practical benefits are considered, but hesitation remains.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Neutral (2). Openness for a trial based on curiosity but not strong desire.
   - **Will consider buying the product:** Strongly Disagree (1.5). Given my preference for thorough job quality and unselfish nature, other factors like budget constraints and trust concerns outweigh the benefits.

Overall, while intrigued by functionality and slightly attracted, personal values, personality traits, and life situation don't fully align with a high purchase intent for this product.
