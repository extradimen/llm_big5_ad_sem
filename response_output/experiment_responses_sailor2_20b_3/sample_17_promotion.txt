**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 4* (Neutral leaning towards Agree)  
   - As a talkative and outgoing person who generally trusts advertisements, I appreciate straightforward messaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 5* (Agree)  
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with daily life challenges, making it an intriguing proposition.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 6* (Strongly Agree)  
   - Combining energy and aesthetics appeal to my desire for practical benefits in a fast-paced lifestyle.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 3* (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)  
   - While the message is compelling, its overall aesthetic or presentation might not grab me instantly.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 2* (Disagree)  
   - Despite my inclination for energizing products, financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income) make it less feasible now.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 3* (Neutral leaning towards Agree)  
   - If the price is reasonable and there are discounts or special offers, I might be tempted.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 2* (Disagree)  
   - While it's interesting, current budget limitations mean consideration without a compelling offer would not translate into immediate purchase intent.

Overall, the advertisement aligns with my practical needs but falls short in terms of affordability and urgency. The score reflects cautious optimism about its appeal versus reality constraints.
