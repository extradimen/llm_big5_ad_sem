**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 2)  
   As someone who is generally not talkative, you find it neither compelling nor off-putting.
   
2. **Interesting:** Slightly Disagree (Score: 3)  
   The claims about energy and appearance might be generic; they don't capture your attention.

3. **Good:** Agree slightly (Score: 4)  
   It's functional, but not particularly well-crafted or impactful for you.
   
4. **Attractive:** Slightly Disagree (Score: 3)  
   The visual appeal and messaging lack the personal relevance to make it appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)  
   Despite being a blue-collar worker, daily energy drinks seem less essential given other priorities.
   
2. **Try to buy:** Disagree (Score: 2)  
   No immediate need or urgency to experiment with new products.

3. **Consider buying:** Agree slightly (Score: 4)  
   While not highly motivated, you might think about it if the product aligns well with future needs or promotions attractively lower the cost.

In summary, while the ad does not particularly resonate emotionally, there's a slight possibility of considering purchase under specific conditions. The overall attitude is neutral to mildly positive but without strong intent for immediate action.
