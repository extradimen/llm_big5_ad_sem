**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - Neutral with slight leaning towards positive; while energized and looking good sound appealing on paper, my reserved nature means it doesn't immediately grab me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - Somewhat interested but not strongly drawn in because I prioritize practical benefits over appearance-focused claims at this stage of life.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; it feels somewhat generic and doesn't resonate deeply with my personal values or current needs as a student balancing studies and family responsibilities.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning toward neutral but not strongly attracted due to mixed feelings about its relevance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; I'm currently focused on budget constraints and essential needs, making high-priced beverages non-priority.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Somewhat disagree; there's a small possibility if it appears extremely affordable or during limited-time offers but not under regular circumstances.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; even considering the purchase seems unlikely given my current financial situation and priorities.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential benefits, practicality and budget considerations overshadow any initial appeal from this advertisement for me personally. Thus, low scores reflect a cautious and financially prudent mindset that aligns with my demographics and personality traits.
