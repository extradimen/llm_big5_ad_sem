**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): While it's not overly engaging due to my reserved nature, I acknowledge its intent.
  - The ad is interesting (Score: 4): It presents a functional benefit that could resonate with students needing energy and self-confidence.
  - The ad is good (Score: 5): It conveys clear benefits but lacks emotional or personal connection for me.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Not particularly appealing given my preference for authenticity over surface-level promises.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - Intent to purchase this product (Score: 1): Despite its claims, my current financial constraints and careful spending habits discourage a significant commitment.
  - Will try to buy this product (Score: 2): There's a slight curiosity but no strong pull due to the low monthly income constraint.
  - Consider buying it (Score: 3): I might evaluate if faced with an urgent need or favorable pricing, otherwise, alternatives would be prioritized.

Overall, though understanding its utility, my reserved and practical nature along with financial limitations lead me to a generally cautious reaction. The ad is functional but doesnâ€™t elicit strong personal appeal or immediate intent to buy.
