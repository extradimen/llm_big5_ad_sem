**Evaluation and Rationale:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (Score 4):** The ad is neutral in appeal for me; it's neither exceptionally engaging nor off-putting.
2. **Interesting (Score 5):** I find aspects of energy drinks interesting, but not groundbreaking enough to stand out from other ads.
3. **Good (Score 3):** It presents a basic benefit that resonates with my need for staying energized and looking good, though it feels generic.
4. **Attractive (Score 6):** The idea of being energetic and confident is appealing, so the ad has some visual and emotional attractiveness.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** I don't have a strong intention to buy this product right now since there are many similar options in my market.
2. **Try to Buy:** While not strongly motivated, I might give it a try if the opportunity arises (e.g., during sales or discounts).
3. **Consider Buying:** Given my helpful and original nature, I'll keep an open mind for potential future purchases, especially considering its claimed benefits.

Overall, while the ad resonates slightly with my preferences due to its energetic appeal, personal purchase intent remains moderate given existing options and price sensitivity in Southeast Asia.
