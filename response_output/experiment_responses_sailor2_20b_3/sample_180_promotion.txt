**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): While not strongly disagreeing, my talkative and emotionally stable nature doesn't find it particularly appealing.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): It sparks a mild interest due to its promise of energy boost but lacks excitement for me personally.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5): Objectively, it seems reasonably convincing about staying energized and looking best, though not exceptional. 
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Given my neutral social tendencies, it doesn't attract or resonate strongly visually.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; despite needing energy, a $<15 million VND monthly income makes premium-priced drinks non-priorities.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 1): No intention or motivation to test it given my financial constraints and current brand loyalty elsewhere.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 2): Mild consideration, but only if there's a significant price drop or special offer aligning with budget realities.

Overall, while the ad is moderately well-crafted and makes logical claims, its appeal doesn't translate into strong purchase intent for someone like myself managing financial limitations in Southeast Asia.
