**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Like the ad:** Neutral (3) - The straightforward message about fatigue and appearance might appeal slightly, but it's not particularly engaging.
  
- **Interesting:** Slightly Agree (4) - It conveys a clear benefit that resonates with personal wellness concerns.

- **Good quality:** Agree (5) - The ad effectively communicates the necessity of avoiding tiredness and dull looks, which is persuasive in its simplicity.
 
- **Attractive:** Disagree (2) - While informative, it lacks visual or emotional appeal for someone who values originality and imagination less (Disagree).

**Purchase Intention:**

- **Intend to purchase:** Neutral (3) - The ad motivates but doesn't create a strong impulse due to personal preference for practical over flashy products.
  
- **Try to buy:** Slightly Agree (4) - It nudges curiosity enough that you might give it a try, especially with its functional promise.

- **Consider buying:** Agree (5) - Given the focus on preventing tiredness and maintaining appearance, it aligns well with daily concerns and is worth considering if other factors like price or brand reputation match expectations. 

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates urgency, its lack of emotional flair and originality slightly diminishes immediate purchase intent but leaves room for consideration as a practical solution.
