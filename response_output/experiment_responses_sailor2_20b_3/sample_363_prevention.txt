**Evaluation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – While I appreciate its attempt to highlight potential discomfort without the product, it doesn't resonate strongly.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) – The concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance can grab attention due to its practical relevance.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree (2) – It lacks depth in evidence or emotional connection; feels superficial.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (3) – While mildly engaging, it doesn’t fully capture my interest.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Agree (2) – The appeal is enough for consideration but not a strong buying signal.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my reservations about the ad’s effectiveness, there's no immediate motivation to trial it.
3. **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral (3) – Open to exploring if backed by more substantial testimonials or reviews.

In summary, while the advertisement is somewhat engaging and practical, its overall impact on purchase intention remains cautious due to a lack of compelling evidence and emotional resonance. Additional information could shift my consideration closer to intent.
