**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (4)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly positive. The ad is appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
  - **Interesting (5)**: Moderate interest due to energy and appearance claims.
  - **Good (6)**: I find the message well-crafted, emphasizing benefits that are generally valuable for health-conscious individuals like me.
  - **Attractive (3)**: While it's somewhat attractive, it doesn't stand out strongly. The language is generic rather than compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase**: Slight inclination but not a firm commitment due to mixed feelings about the ad and other factors like budget constraints.
  - **Will try**: Neutral intention; I might give it a shot if available in local stores or recommended by trusted friends.
  - **Consider buying**: Low-medium consideration. The benefits are clear, but there's no strong push from my personal needs or current situation.

Overall, the ad is moderately effective, touching upon values of staying energized and looking good, yet lacks an emotional connection to fully convince me to make a purchase decision immediately.
