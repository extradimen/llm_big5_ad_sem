**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **Like (Score 4)**: Neutral; Given my reserved nature and a preference for practicality, while I appreciate its attempt at appealing to energy and appearance needs, it doesn't evoke strong personal excitement.
   - **Interesting (Score 5)**: Agree; The messaging around staying energized and looking your best aligns with common desires, making the ad engaging enough to capture attention briefly.
   - **Good (Score 4)**: Neutral; While conceptually sound, I am skeptical about immediate benefits without more concrete proof or relatability to my lifestyle as a blue-collar worker.
   - **Attractive (Score 3)**: Disagree; The visual and emotional appeal might not fully resonate with someone who prioritizes practicality over aesthetics in their daily life.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend**: Disagree (Score 2); Given my monthly income constraints, the perceived value must be substantial for me to make a purchase decision.
   - **Try**: Disagree (Score 3); Although not opposed entirely, there's no immediate urgency or compelling reason from this ad alone to try out the product.
   - **Consider**: Neutral (Score 4); I will ponder if future offers align better with my needs and budget, showing some openness but cautious optimism.

Overall, while moderately intrigued by the message, practical considerations like cost-efficiency and real-world benefits take precedence over an attractive yet potentially aspirational promotion.
