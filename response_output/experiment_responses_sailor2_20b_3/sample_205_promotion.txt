**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3)**: While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, my generally strong agreement with talkativeness doesn't mean it's irresistible.
  - **Interesting (2)**: The message is straightforward but lacks compelling details or emotional appeal for someone like me who values uniqueness.
  - **Good (4)**: It’s an okay ad; not bad, just average in terms of persuasive value given my preferences and skepticism.
  - **Attractive (1)**: Strongly disagree here—its simplicity feels uninspired compared to ads that play on creativity or trustworthiness.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (2)**: I'm not highly motivated by this ad, but the idea has some appeal due to wanting energy and looking good.
  - **Try (3)**: Slightly higher than "intend" because occasional curiosity might prompt a trial purchase if accessible.
  - **Consider (4)**: Given my active imagination and preference for originality, I’m open enough to consider it despite reservations about the ad’s quality.

Overall, while not strongly drawn in by this advertisement, I retain a modest inclination towards considering or trying the product due to personal needs around energy levels and appearance.
