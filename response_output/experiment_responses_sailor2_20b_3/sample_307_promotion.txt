**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **Like the Ad (Score: 2)**:
   - Although I'm talkative and outgoing, this ad lacks a personal connection or relatability for me given my daily stress balancing work as a managerial employee with family responsibilities.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)**:
   - The concept of staying energized resonates somewhat due to needing energy boosts, but the claim seems generic without specific details on how it will help.

3. **Good Ad (Score: 4)**:
   - It's well-meaning and aligns with wellness trends in general, making me neutral rather than strongly positive or negative.
   
4. **Attractive (Score: 5)**:
   - Visually appealing designs can be attractive, but my reservations about the lack of concrete benefits keep it from being highly enticing.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3)**:
   - While I appreciate staying energized and looking good, without specific assurances or compelling features, intent is moderate.
   
2. **Will Try to Buy (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral tendency to try it if available locally or during sales but not actively pursuing this purchase over others.

3. **Consider Buying (Score: 4)**:
   - Given my practical and thorough nature, I'd keep it in mind as a potential option without full commitment until further information is provided.

In summary, the advertisement aligns with some of my values like energy boost needs but fails to deeply engage or convince due to its generic presentation. Hence, while not strongly disliked, it doesn't push me towards immediate purchase intent either.
