**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Neutral): Given my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality, I don't feel an immediate connection or positive vibe from the advertisement.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Disagree): The claims seem generic rather than unique; thus, it doesn’t capture much attention for me.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Agree): While not overly convincing, I appreciate its clear goals of energizing and enhancing appearance—basic needs relevant to anyone's daily life.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Strongly Disagree): The visual or emotional appeal doesn't resonate with my personality traits; it feels somewhat superficial.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Disagree): I’m cautious due to my general trust issues and preference for tried-and-tested products, especially since the ad lacks specific credibility.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Slightly Neutral/Inclined towards Disagree): There’s a small inclination based on need but not enough motivation without more proof or recommendations from trusted sources.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Mildly Considerable): While I'm unlikely to rush out, the health and appearance benefits make it worth pondering if given additional information.

Overall, though mildly appealing in terms of goals, the ad's execution does not strongly influence my purchase decision due to personal traits like skepticism and reserved nature. It’s on the lower side but still a potential option for future consideration.
