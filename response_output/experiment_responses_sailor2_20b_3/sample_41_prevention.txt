**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - **Like (Score 2)**: The ad feels somewhat appealing to me due to its clear messaging about fatigue and appearance.
   - **Interesting (Score 3)**: It grabs my attention as it addresses common concerns related to energy levels, but doesn't excite me enough.
   - **Good (Score 4)**: As a person who values thoroughness, the ad does present an issue worth addressing. However, it falls short on deeper engagement and creativity.
   - **Attractive (Score 3)**: The visuals and messaging are moderately attractive, though not captivating given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score 5)**: While I acknowledge the potential benefit of reducing fatigue, other factors such as budget restrictions (<15,000,000 VND/month) and concerns about effectiveness influence my intention.
   - **Try to Buy (Score 6)**: There's a moderate inclination to give it a try if presented with reasonable pricing or discounts since addressing tiredness is important for productivity.
   - **Consider Buying (Score 5)**: Overall, I would consider this product due to its direct relevance but won't rush into purchase decisions without further information.

In summary, the advertisement has mild appeal and resonates partly with my values of responsibility and health, yet more compelling evidence or personal connection could enhance both liking and willingness to buy.
