**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad (score = 5):**
  - While it's not strongly negative, I find myself neutral to slightly positive. The message about fatigue and dull appearance can resonate with my experience as a civil servant.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
  - It’s intriguing but lacks depth; it might appeal more if backed by credible details or personal stories related to everyday stress.

- **I believe the ad is good (score = 3):**
  - There's a mild sense of reliability, yet without solid proof or testimonials, my skepticism hovers around neutral.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):**
  - The appeal diminishes due to its vague nature and potential for hyperbole. It doesn't strongly draw me in.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):** 
  - Not high, as the lack of credibility or specific benefits makes it hard to justify an immediate buy.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
  - Mild curiosity may lead me to consider a trial if there’s substantial evidence elsewhere.

- **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):**
  - Given my generally trusting but cautious nature, I’m open to considering it once more information or user feedback is available.

In summary, the ad touches on relevant concerns and slightly engages due to its theme of fatigue prevention. However, my strong emphasis on thoroughness and careful decision-making means a higher score hinges on supplementary evidence and reassurance from trustworthy sources. Thus, while not dismissive, I'm cautious with both attitude towards the ad and purchase intent.
