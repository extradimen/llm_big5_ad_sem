**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3):** Neutral; it doesn’t strongly appeal but isn't disliked.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (4):** Agreeable; resonates slightly with my curiosity and open-minded nature.
   - **I believe the ad is good (5):** Slightly agree; effective in highlighting potential drawbacks without being overly negative or manipulative.
   - **I find the ad attractive (3):** Neutral to leaning towards disagree, as it’s focused on negatives rather than appealing benefits.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2):** Disagree; while I appreciate its message, there isn’t a strong urge to buy.
   - **Will try to buy this product (2):** Disagree; the advertisement doesn't motivate me enough for an immediate trial.
   - **Will consider buying it (3):** Neutral-to-agree; open to giving it some thought but not convinced yet.

Overall, though I appreciate the cautionary approach and recognize its effectiveness in highlighting potential downsides, personal preference leans towards more engaging or positive messaging. The product may still be considered for purchase if further information aligns with my needs and values.
