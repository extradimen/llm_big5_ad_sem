**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (4):** While I appreciate its intent to promote energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't resonate strongly with me.
  - **Interesting (5):** The concept is intriguing but not particularly engaging given my daily priorities as a blue-collar worker.
  - **Good (6):** Itâ€™s a well-constructed ad that promises positive outcomes, which makes it seem generally favorable. 
  - **Attractive (3):** Despite its attractive packaging and messaging, the appeal feels somewhat superficial.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Score of **2**: While I acknowledge the benefits offered, my limited income and existing budget constraints make a direct intent to buy unlikely.
  - **Will try to buy:** Score of **1**: Given my reserved nature and thoroughness in spending decisions, trying out this product seems low on my priority list.
  - **Consider buying:** Score of **2**: There's room for consideration if it aligns with an occasional health or energy boost need but won't be a regular purchase.

Overall, I find the ad appealing to its target audience but do not see myself making significant changes in purchasing behavior due to practical constraints and my personality traits.
