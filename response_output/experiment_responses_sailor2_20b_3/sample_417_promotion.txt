**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **I like the ad**:  
   *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
   - As a reserved individual, I appreciate straightforward messaging but find this somewhat generic and not specifically tailored to my lifestyle.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**:  
   *Score: 4 (Agree)*
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with me, especially for daily chores as a blue-collar worker; however, its appeal isn't groundbreaking enough.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good**:
   *Score: 5 (Strongly Agree)* 
   - It’s well-meaning and delivers on basic health claims that align with my values of doing thorough work and maintaining energy levels.

4. **I find the ad attractive**:  
   *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
   - The presentation feels somewhat superficial, lacking depth or specific details I consider trustworthy for a product purchase decision.
   
5. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
    - **Intend to purchase this product**: 
      *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
      - While the benefits sound practical, my cautious nature requires more information and possibly a trial run before committing fully.

    - **Try to buy this product**:  
      *Score: 4 (Agree)*
      - Given its reasonable price range for my income bracket ($26M–$35M VND), I might try it out, especially if there’s an introductory offer or recommendation from a trusted source.
      
    - **Consider buying the product**:
      *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
      - The ad sparks mild interest but doesn’t drive immediate action. More context on ingredients, customer reviews, and potential long-term benefits would sway me more positively.

Overall, while I respect its functional messaging, further details and personal endorsements are crucial to turning a positive attitude into an actual purchase decision for this drink.
