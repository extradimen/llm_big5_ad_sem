**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad (2)*: Given my reserved personality and tendency to be less talkative and outgoing, I find the ad somewhat unappealing.
  - *Interesting (3)*: While it hints at a common issue, its messaging is generic and not particularly engaging for me personally.
  - *Good (4)*: Neutral on whether it presents itself well or effectively; doesn't resonate strongly enough to qualify as "good."
  - *Attractive (1)*: Strongly disagree with the ad being attractive due to its bland presentation.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (1)*: I have no strong inclination, especially considering my reserved nature and lack of enthusiasm.
  - *Try to buy (1)*: Minimal interest in attempting a new drink with these vague claims.
  - *Consider buying (2)*: Might give it some thought under pressure situations but generally not an appealing option.

Overall, the ad falls short in engaging or persuading me due to its lack of personal relevance and my inherent reserved disposition. While theoretically acknowledging its purpose, there's little motivation for purchase intention.
