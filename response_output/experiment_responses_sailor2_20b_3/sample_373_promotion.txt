**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): The appeal is minimal given my strong preference for practicality over marketing hype.
  - I think it's interesting (Score: 4): It offers a basic promise of energy and appearance benefits, piquing curiosity slightly but not strongly engaging me.
  - I believe it’s good (Score: 5): Neutral-to-positive because staying energized is generally beneficial, though skepticism about its efficacy remains.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 3): Attractiveness is low due to my tendency towards practicality and emotional stability issues; visual appeal isn’t a major draw.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): Not strongly, as routine health products need proven results or personal relevance.
  - I will try to buy it (Score: 1): Minimal likelihood of immediate action given skepticism and the current range of options available.
  - I will consider buying it (Score: 2): Mild consideration for future use if other needs align with its benefits.

Overall, while recognizing the product's potential value, my reserved nature combined with concern about emotional stability leads to a balanced but cautious evaluation. The ad is moderately interesting yet not compelling enough on its own to drive purchase intent.
