**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate the idea of staying energized and looking good, it feels somewhat generic.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The concept isn't entirely uninteresting but could be more compelling with a unique angle or benefits tailored to my personality traits.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - It lacks depth and specific details that would resonate deeply, particularly for someone who values thoroughness (Strongly Disagree).
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)** - The generic promise does not attract me as much; it doesn't speak to my core needs or align with my strong focus on practicality over superficial appearance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - While I'm open to products that boost energy, the ad's lack of detail and personal relevance lowers my immediate intent.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral tendency; might consider a trial if recommended by someone trustworthy or if it offers substantial proof-of-effectiveness.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - The thought remains but not urgent, as other priorities and current routines take precedence over an unspecific energy drink promotion.

Overall, while there's a mild interest sparked by the general message, the ad needs more personalized appeal to significantly influence my purchase behavior. Emotional stability concerns also play into considering cautious steps before making any decisions.
