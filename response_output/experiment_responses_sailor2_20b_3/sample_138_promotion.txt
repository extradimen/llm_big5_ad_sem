**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - I like the ad (score = 3): While the message of staying energized and looking good appeals to some extent, it doesn't strongly resonate given my cautious nature.
   - Interesting (4): The concept is moderately interesting but not particularly engaging due to my reserved personality.
   - Good (5): It conveys a positive benefit which aligns with helpfulness in maintaining personal well-being; however, neutrality on imagination and originality means the creative execution doesn't stand out.
   - Attractive (2): Due to my tendency for reservation and emotional sensitivity, I find it slightly unappealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - Intent to purchase (1): Given my current financial constraints (< 15 million VND/month) and practical approach, the cost likely outweighs perceived benefits.
   - Will try to buy (1): Lack of urgency or confidence in the product's necessity means no immediate attempt to acquire it.
   - Consider buying (3): While I acknowledge its value proposition, budgetary concerns prevent a firm commitment; still open to future consideration based on need and availability.
