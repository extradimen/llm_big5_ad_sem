**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **I like the ad (Score: 3):** Neutral. While I appreciate straightforward messaging, it doesn't evoke strong positive emotions.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4):** Agreeable. The concept of avoiding fatigue and dullness might catch my attention briefly but isnâ€™t compelling enough to keep me engaged.
  - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5):** Moderately agree. It conveys a clear benefit, which aligns with practical concerns about daily productivity; however, it lacks emotional depth or unique appeal.
  - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2):** Disagree. The straightforward tone might come off as unoriginal and could be seen as manipulative by emphasizing negatives without offering much reassurance.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree. Despite acknowledging the issue it addresses, my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make high-cost supplements or beverages non-priority.
  - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** Slightly agree. I might consider a sample offer if available but not actively seek it out due to budget limitations and skepticism regarding immediate effects without thorough research.
  - **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3):** Agree. Given my helpful nature, I appreciate preventive health measures in theory; however, practicality and cost-effectiveness heavily influence any final decision.

Overall, the ad resonates on a functional level but falls short of inspiring enthusiasm or immediate action due to its lack of differentiation and financial constraints impacting purchasing decisions. Practical benefits are noted without compelling emotional engagement.
