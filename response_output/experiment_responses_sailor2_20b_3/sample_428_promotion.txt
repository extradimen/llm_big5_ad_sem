**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *Like (3):* Neutral; I don't particularly dislike but also not strongly drawn to it.
  - *Interesting (4):* Agreeable, as the concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing on a superficial level. 
  - *Good (5):* Generally positive—promises utility for daily life, which can be seen as beneficial.
  - *Attractive (2):* Strongly Disagree; The ad feels too generic and lacks a compelling emotional connection or authenticity, making it less attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Strongly Disagree (1). Despite liking the concept, my personal values and current priorities don't align with investing in such products right now.
  - *Try to Buy:* Disagree (2). Given my budget constraints (36M–45M VND) and limited interest, I'm unlikely to make a spontaneous or frequent purchase.
  - *Consider Buying:* Neutral (3). If the product offers substantial value relative to cost, it might be an occasional consideration but not a top priority.

In summary, while finding some elements of the ad appealing, my practical outlook as a blue-collar worker with specific personality traits leads me to score lower on purchasing intent. The message is engaging enough to consider but falls short in compelling me towards immediate or frequent buying actions.
