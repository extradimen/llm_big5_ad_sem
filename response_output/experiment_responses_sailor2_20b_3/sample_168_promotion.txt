**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad**: While I appreciate that it's promoting energy and appearance, my reserved nature makes me neutral towards ads in general. Hence, a score of `3`.
  - **Interesting**: The promise to stay energized resonates with blue-collar work stress (Agree), giving it a `4`.
  - **Good**: Emphasizing looking oneâ€™s best aligns slightly but not strongly enough (`5`).
  - **Attractive**: Given my generally cautious and sometimes nervous disposition, the ad feels less attractive (`2`, Disagree).

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to purchase**: My budget constraints (<15 million VND) coupled with skepticism about the cost effectiveness makes this highly unlikely (Strongly Disagree).
  - **Try to buy**: Even though interested in benefits, the perceived higher price and occasional nervousness make me hesitant (`2`, Disagree).
  - **Consider buying**: Neutral due to mixed feelings between potential need for energy boost vs. budget concerns and lack of urgency (`3`).

Overall, while recognizing some value, practical constraints outweigh the ad's appeal significantly.
