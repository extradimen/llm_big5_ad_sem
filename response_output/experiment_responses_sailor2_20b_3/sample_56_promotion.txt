**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes (Scale of 7):**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards a mild positive response as I appreciate its aim to boost energy and appearance.
    - Score: 4
  - **Interesting:** While appealing in concept, it doesn't stand out significantly for me. 
    - Score: 3
  - **Good:** The claim seems plausible but lacks the depth or credibility needed to fully convince someone my age with reserved tendencies.
    - Score: 5 (moderately agree)
  - **Attractive:** It's not visually or conceptually engaging enough given my preferences for more substantive content.
    - Score: 2

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly disagree. Though I value health and appearance, the ad doesn't persuade me as a regular buyer with limited income.
    - Score: 1
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Mild curiosity but not enough motivation given my cautious nature (strong agreement on being reserved).
    - Score: 2
  - **Consider buying it:** Might consider if the price point and benefits align better, balancing health goals with financial reality.
    - Score: 3

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's message, its attractiveness falls short for me personally. My purchase intention is tempered by practicality and cautious nature, making consideration rather than immediate action more likely.
