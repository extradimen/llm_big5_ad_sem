**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like:** Neutral (Score: 5)  
   While not strongly negative or positive, I appreciate its intent but find it somewhat generic.
   
2. **Interesting:** Agree (Score: 6)  
   The promise of energy and looking good is engaging for a busy professional.

3. **Good:** Neutral to Slightly Positive (Score: 4)  
   It’s effective in conveying benefits without being overly flashy, aligning with my preference for substance over flashiness.
   
4. **Attractive:** Disagree (Score: 3)  
   The appeal is modest; it may not strongly stand out compared to more creative ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral-Tending Negative (Score: 2)  
   Despite liking the message, other factors like brand trust and budget come into play before making a purchase decision.
   
2. **Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)  
   Given my tendency towards careful spending and thorough job performance, I’m unlikely to impulsively try this product without further evaluation.

3. **Consider Buying:** Neutral-Tending Positive (Score: 2)  
   The benefits are appealing enough for me to keep it on the list of options but not a priority right now due to other commitments and existing choices in my routine.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately with its message and is somewhat attractive, practical considerations from my background (as a civil servant with meticulous habits) steer towards cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
