**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (score: 2)** - I find it somewhat negative due to its focus on negatives ("feel tired," "look dull"). It's slightly engaging but not very appealing.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)** - The concept holds basic appeal, as everyone might relate to occasional fatigue and wanting a fresh appearance, but it lacks depth or creativity that would grab my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 4)** - It's serviceable in its messaging and may resonate with some consumers who prioritize immediate energy boosts. However, it doesn't inspire strong conviction for me personally.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 1)** - Given my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious, this straightforward appeal seems manipulative rather than appealing. I prefer more balanced or thoughtful advertising.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)** - There is minimal intent due to a lack of strong personal motivation. While acknowledging its utility, my current situation and budgetary constraints would discourage immediate action.
  
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - Even if I see some value, the effort needed to actively seek it out outweighs my mild interest.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 3)** - There is a small level of consideration based on the ad’s relevance; however, other factors like budget, lifestyle alignment, and personal preference would need further evaluation before making an actual purchase decision.

In summary, while the advertisement might be acceptable in function, it doesn’t captivate or strongly motivate me due to my reserved nature, neutral views on helpfulness/trust, and slight carelessness. I'm open to considering but unlikely to rush into buying based solely on this ad.
