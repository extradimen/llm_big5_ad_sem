**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad. (4)**: Neutral leaning towards a slight liking since it addresses fatigue and appearance concerns relevant to daily life.
  - **Interesting (3)**: Finds some intrigue in how the drink affects energy levels but not entirely engaging due to personal preference for straightforward messaging.
  - **Good (2)**: Feels average; lacks strong credibility or emotional appeal, especially given my reserved nature.
  - **Attractive (1)**: Not appealing visually nor emotionally; doesn't resonate well with my preferences and values.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Mild intention influenced by the relevance of fatigue but not strong enough for a definite commitment due to budget constraints.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (2)**: Will consider giving it a trial if I find other aspects (e.g., reviews, affordability) convincing despite my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality.
  - **Consider buying the product. (1)**: A low score indicates that while there's acknowledgment of its potential benefit, overall, external factors would significantly impact the decision to buy this drink.

In summary, although open-minded about preventing tiredness with a beverage, personal traits like being reserved and cautious drive moderate interest without compelling me towards immediate or high-intent purchases.
