**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I'm talkative and somewhat agreeable, the message feels overemphasized and slightly manipulative.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2)** - The idea of avoiding tiredness or dull appearance isn't particularly engaging for me; it's generic and expected in this product category.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 1)** - It lacks novelty, credibility, and alignment with my personal values—more straightforward ads would have better appeal to someone like me who worries a lot but needs reassurance from trusted sources.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4)** - The visual elements might be visually appealing, but it doesn't resonate emotionally or logically enough.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Despite being a managerial employee with concerns about productivity and appearance, I don’t feel compelled by the ad alone.
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Slight curiosity due to common marketing tactics but not enough to push for immediate action.
3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Given my tendency towards thoroughness when making decisions, I would need more information (e.g., reviews, personal recommendations) before committing.

Overall, the ad is somewhat appealing visually and practically, but it doesn't resonate deeply or inspire strong purchase intent for a person with my background and personality traits. Additional reassurances and credibility would be necessary to boost interest.
