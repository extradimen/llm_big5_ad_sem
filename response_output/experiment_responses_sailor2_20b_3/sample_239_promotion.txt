**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (4/7)**: While I don't strongly dislike it, neither does it excite me given my reserved and practical nature.
2. **Interesting (3/7)**: The promise of energy and better appearance is generic; more specific details would make it more engaging.
3. **Good (5/7)**: It conveys a positive message about health and wellness, which aligns with being thorough in tasks but lacks the personal touch I prefer.
4. **Attractive (3/7)**: The ad looks somewhat appealing visually, but its general appeal doesn’t strongly resonate.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase (2/7)**: Despite finding it decent, my reserved and cautious nature means I need more evidence or a compelling reason.
2. **Try to Buy (1/7)**: My financial comfort allows for occasional purchases but not without clear benefits matching personal values.
3. **Consider Buying (3/7)**: The idea is on the table due to its health-oriented claims, yet it doesn’t spur immediate action.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's goals and message, my personality traits lead me towards a moderate level of interest with a cautious approach to purchasing decisions.
