**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *Like:* Given my reserved and cautious nature, combined with a strong tendency towards thoroughness but also carelessness, I find this promotional message too simplistic. It doesn't resonate emotionally or practically.
  - *Interesting:* The concept feels overplayed in common advertising tropes; nothing new here.
  - *Good:* Neutral because it lacks depth—no compelling reasons why the drink is superior to alternatives.
  - *Attractive:* Strongly disagree, as it appears manipulative rather than trustworthy.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to purchase:* Based on my current lifestyle and financial constraints (26–35 million VND monthly), I prioritize practical needs over perceived energy boosters. The ad does not persuade me enough.
  - *Try the product:* Given the potential cost, my tendency towards carelessness doesn't outweigh careful consideration or actual need for such products.
  - *Consider buying:* Even with a slightly higher score due to occasional concern about fatigue, this falls into "disagree" territory because it's unlikely I'll actively seek out this drink.

In summary, while acknowledging its intent, the ad is unconvincing and does not align well with my values or lifestyle preferences. Therefore, both attitude scores and purchase intentions are low, making it an ineffective advertisement for me personally.
