**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 3):** The statement is somewhat appealing but doesn't strongly resonate.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** It piques some interest due to addressing common fatigue concerns, making it slightly engaging.
   - **Good (score = 5):** I find the message straightforward and potentially effective in promoting its benefits.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** The ad lacks emotional appeal or a compelling design for me; it feels generic.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Despite my reservations, the product's promise of combating fatigue is somewhat convincing (score = 4).
   - **Try to buy this product:** There's a moderate inclination to give it a try due to its relevance to daily experiences (score = 5).
   - **Consider buying:** Ultimately, I would seriously consider purchasing if it aligns with my budget and other needs (score = 6).

Overall, the ad taps into a practical concern but falls short in emotional appeal. My intent is moderately high despite occasional skepticism towards promotional claims.
