**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (2). While it aligns with my need for energy, its overall presentation doesn't particularly excite me due to mixed personal preferences.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (3). The concept of staying energized and looking good resonates well enough as a common goal among peers.
   - **Good quality/ad message:** Somewhat agree (4). It presents clear benefits but lacks the creativity or emotional appeal that might make it stand out for me personally.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly disagree (1). Given my tendency to be careless and not particularly drawn to overly polished ads, its aesthetics do not attract me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Slightly agree (2). The benefits are appealing but the ad itself doesn't push me over the edge.
   - **Try to buy:** Neutral (3). There's a mix of curiosity and skepticism; I'm open-minded about trying it based on its claims, especially for convenience.
   - **Consider buying:** Somewhat agree (4). Overall, while not compelled strongly by the ad, the idea aligns with my lifestyle needs, making consideration practical.

In summary, though parts of the message are aligned with my preferences and goals, the presentation doesn't fully resonate emotionally or visually. Hence, it earns neutral-to-mildly-positive scores without being a strong pull for immediate purchase but remains on the list to consider due to its functional relevance.
