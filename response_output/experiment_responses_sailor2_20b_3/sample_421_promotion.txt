**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores (like, interesting, good, attractive):**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (`5`), as it aligns with my need for energy and looking good.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat agreeable (`4`). The promise of daily benefits grabs attention but could be more compelling.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Quite agree (`6`). It seems trustworthy in its message, appealing to health-conscious aspects.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly favorable (`5`), as it resonates with my preference for staying energized and presentable.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores (intend, try, consider):**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards moderate interest (`3`). While appealing, other factors like budget and brand familiarity weigh in.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Slightly inclined (`3`), given my preference for planning but cautious due to cost concerns.
   - **Consider buying the product:** Less likely (`2`), despite being intrigued; I need more information on pricing and long-term effects before making a firm decision.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively addresses my desire for energy and appearance, it doesn't immediately drive high purchase intent. Further details would be required to make me confidently consider or intend to buy this product.
