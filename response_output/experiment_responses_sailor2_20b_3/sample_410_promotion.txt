**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 5)**: While I appreciate energizing products and maintaining an appearance, it feels somewhat generic. The appeal isn't overwhelming but neutral to positive.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's not groundbreaking; similar promises are common in this category, so novelty is lacking.

- **Good (Score: 3)**: As a thorough worker who values quality, I find the claims reasonable but not particularly compelling. The ad could be more detailed and authentic to boost its credibility.
  
- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Given my somewhat skeptical nature due to high stress levels and emotional instability, the attractive factor is minimal. It feels too much like an over-hyped promotion.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: The concept aligns with staying energized, but personal experiences haven't driven a strong desire yet.
  
- **Try to buy (Score: 2)**: I'm open to sampling if it's reasonably priced and has good reviews, reflecting my tendency towards cautious decision-making.

- **Consider buying (Score: 1)**: While the idea is there, other priorities and budget constraints mean this product doesn't stand out enough for a strong consideration at present. 

Overall, while not entirely negative, the advertisement falls short of igniting genuine excitement or urgency in my purchasing behavior due to its general appeal, lack of specific details, and personal skepticism regarding marketing promises.
