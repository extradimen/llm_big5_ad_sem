**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 3):** While I appreciate its intent to appeal with energy and appearance benefits, my reserved nature slightly hinders immediate liking.
   - **Interesting:** Strongly Agree (4), as it resonates well for someone who needs daily motivation but keeps a balanced perspective.
   - **Good:** Neutral leans towards Agree (5), recognizing the message is clear yet not overly compelling in its current form.
   - **Attractive:** Tend to be attracted by functional benefits, scoring this slightly higher at 6 due to personal emphasis on wellness and confidence.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score = 4):** I am thoughtful about my purchases but see potential value for a product promising both energy boost and aesthetic appeal.
   - **Will try:** Neutral leans toward Agree (4), as curiosity might lead me to give it a trial run if the ingredients are trustworthy and align with health goals.
   - **Consider buying:** Strongly Agree (5) because, despite being cautious, the ad's focus on daily benefits fits into my goal-oriented mindset, making it plausible for future consideration.

In summary, while I appreciate aspects of the advertisement, its attractiveness is moderate due to personal reserved nature. Purchase intention leans toward a thoughtful trial and eventual strong consideration if additional information or reviews validate its efficacy.
