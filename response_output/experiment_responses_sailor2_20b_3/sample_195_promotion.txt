**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad (Score: 5)**  
While I appreciate that it highlights benefits of staying energized and looking good, my reserved nature makes me less inclined to find it irresistibly engaging.

- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
It does tick some boxes with energy and appearance perks, but as a student with multiple responsibilities, novelty alone isn't enough for sustained interest.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3.5)**  
The message is clear, yet my skepticism and careful nature question if it genuinely meets its promises. Stronger credibility could improve this score.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**  
Given my reserved personality, I don't feel an immediate pull toward flashy ads or quick fixes; practicality takes precedence over attractiveness for me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**  
My cautious approach and neutral-to-disagree stance on untested products mean there's little intention to buy impulsively based solely on the ad.
  
- **Will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**  
Without compelling evidence or personal need, attempting a purchase feels low priority in my current busy life.

- **Consider buying this product (Score: 1.5)**  
There is some mild curiosity, but it won't lead me to actively research or prioritize purchasing the drink over other essential needs and priorities right now.

Overall, while understanding its appeal on paper, personal traits make the ad less persuasive for my decision-making process as a reserved, student, and somewhat anxious individual focusing on practicality. The low scores reflect this balanced yet cautious assessment.
