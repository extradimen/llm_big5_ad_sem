**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad. (3)**: Neutral leaning slightly negative; I don't dislike it but also find no appeal.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (2)**: Disagree – It feels generic, not something that captures my attention or interests me.
- **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: Slightly Agree – Basic message of preventing tiredness and dull appearance seems straightforwardly useful but lacks strong persuasive elements.
- **I find the ad attractive. (1)**: Strongly Disagree – It does not engage visually, emotionally, or persuasively enough for me.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Slightly Agree – While it addresses my desire for energy and appearance, I don’t feel a strong urge.
- **I will try to buy this product. (2)**: Slightly Agree – Curiosity is low; might consider trying once but no immediate plan.
- **I will consider buying this product. (1)**: Disagree – Despite understanding the claims, my budget constraints and lack of compelling evidence make it less likely I'll actively pursue a purchase.

Overall, while acknowledging the potential benefits mentioned in the ad, personal traits like being careful with finances, nervousness about new products, and preference for well-planned actions contribute to lower scores. The message is functional but fails to create strong emotional engagement or trust required from me as an ideal consumer.
