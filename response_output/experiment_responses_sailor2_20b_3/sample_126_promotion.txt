**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** 3 (Neutral)
   - The claim to stay energized and look good is appealing but not enough to make me strongly positive.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 4 (Slightly Agree)
   - It's engaging, particularly if I'm looking for something that boosts energy daily.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 5 (Agree)
   - The message seems straightforward and potentially beneficial, making it a credible promotion.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 2 (Disagree)
   - While not unattractive, my high level of nervousness and tendency to worry makes me skeptical about immediate benefits without further proof.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 3 (Neutral)
   - Thereâ€™s interest but no strong motivation yet; more information would be needed.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** 3 (Slightly Agree)
   - I'm open to giving it a shot, especially if it aligns with my need for daily energy.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 4 (Agree)
   - The product fits into my routine considerations and might be worth trying based on the claims presented in the ad.

Overall, while the advertisement has some appeal, I balance skepticism due to personal tendencies like worrying and nervousness against a willingness to explore potentially helpful products. Therefore, moderate scores reflect both interest and cautious evaluation.
