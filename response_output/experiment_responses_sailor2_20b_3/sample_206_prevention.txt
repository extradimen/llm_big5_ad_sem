**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale)**:
  - **I like the ad:** Score = 4 (Neutral/Agree)
    * While I appreciate its attempt to highlight a common feeling of tiredness and dull appearance, it feels somewhat generic.
  
  - **Interesting:** Score = 5 (Strongly Agree)
    * The concept of preventing tiredness is engaging but could be more creatively presented.

  - **Good:** Score = 3 (Neutral/Disagree)
    * It lacks depth in its messaging. More scientific backing or personal testimonials would make it stronger.
  
  - **Attractive:** Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)
    * The overall appeal is low due to a lack of originality and emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    * Given my strong agreement on being unselfish but also needing compelling evidence, the ad falls short in persuading me directly.
  
  - **Try to buy:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    * No immediate interest or urgency is created by this message; thus, no desire to try it out.
    
  - **Consider buying:** Score = 2 (Neutral/Disagree)
    * I might consider the product in future under different circumstances with better advertising efforts.

**Summary**: While acknowledging the ad's basic appeal and preventing potential negative experiences, its execution does not align well with my values of originality, thoroughness, or emotional engagement. Thus, it doesn't significantly influence my purchase intention at this moment. More compelling storytelling or credibility-enhancing elements are needed to sway me towards considering a buy.
