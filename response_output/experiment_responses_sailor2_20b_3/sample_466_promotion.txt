**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Attitude towards the Ad:**
  - **Like (score=5):** I find the ad appealing because it aligns with my desire to stay energized, especially as a postgraduate student balancing studies. The idea of looking good is also engaging.
  - **Interesting (score=6):** The concept resonates well; maintaining energy and confidence boosts daily productivity, which I value highly.
  - **Good (score=7):** From an overall perspective, the ad effectively communicates positive outcomes—energy and self-presentation—which are important aspects of my lifestyle. Strongly agree here because it taps into personal aspirations.
  - **Attractive (score=4):** While the message is good, I am somewhat reserved on its visual or emotional attractiveness, preferring more relatable or dynamic presentation for a stronger connection.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Despite liking the ad and seeing its benefits, my current budget constraints mean that it's not a priority right now (score=3).
  - **Try to Buy:** Given how busy I am with studies and family responsibilities, trying out new products requires some commitment. Hence, moderate inclination but not immediate (score=2).
  - **Consider Buying:** The product is definitely on my radar; its features are attractive enough that I would seriously think about it when the timing aligns better or if there’s a favorable deal (score=3).

Overall, while highly receptive to the ad's message and values, practical considerations like budget and immediate priorities temper my intent towards an outright purchase.
