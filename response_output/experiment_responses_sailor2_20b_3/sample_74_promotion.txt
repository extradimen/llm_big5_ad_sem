**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

- **I like the ad. (4/7)**  
  While I appreciate the energy and freshness message conveyed by the ad, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved nature.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7)**
  The energetic appeal piques some interest but feels a bit generic; more creative execution might elevate its intrigue for me.

- **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**
  On paper, it's decent and functional, promoting health benefits I value as a civil servant needing consistent energy levels, yet lacks an emotional hook.
  
- **I find the ad attractive. (2/7)**  
  The visual appeal isn't compelling enough; modern design or personalization would make it more appealing to someone like me who prioritizes thoroughness and practicality.

### Purchase Intention

- **I intend to purchase this product. (1/7)**
  Despite its potential benefits, I don’t have a strong urge to buy due to my reserved nature and existing routines.
  
- **I will try to buy this product. (1/7)**
  Without significant personal connection or urgency, trying the product isn't high on my list of priorities.

- **I will consider buying this product. (2/7)**
  The ad has given me a bit of consideration as it aligns with staying energized, though other factors—like budget and existing habits—will need to be weighed before making a purchase decision.

In summary, the advertisement has moderate appeal but doesn’t drive strong intention due to my personality traits and current preferences. While I acknowledge its effectiveness in promoting energy and appearance benefits, there's room for improvement in engaging aspects more deeply tailored to my demographic profile and psychology.
