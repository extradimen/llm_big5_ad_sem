**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
   - **Like (4/7):** As an outgoing and sociable individual who appreciates energetic lifestyles but tends to be cautious and not easily persuaded by flashy claims alone.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The concept of staying energized resonates with my active personality, making it engaging yet not entirely compelling.
   - **Good (6/7):** I believe the idea has merit; health-consciousness is important to me. However, specific details about effectiveness are missing.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** While visually appealing may help, personal trust and evidence matter more than mere attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Despite liking the ad conceptually, a strong intent to purchase is low due to my tendency toward thoroughness but current carelessness.
   - **Try (3/7):** I'm open-minded enough to give it a chance if there's reliable feedback from peers or reviews. 
   - **Consider (4/7):** The product aligns with my health goals, so while not urgent, it's definitely on the radar for future consideration.

Overall, the advertisement intrigues me and hits some personal values but needs more convincing details to convert interest into a purchase decision immediately.
