2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - Mildly engaging, using fatigue and dullness to capture attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - I appreciate its straightforward messaging about preventing tiredness and looking better.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - It's not particularly appealing visually or emotionally due to my generally lower interest in persuasive ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 3) - Neutral, as it might address a real need but isn't compelling enough for immediate action.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 4) - I may give it a chance if the price fits within my budget and convenience is high.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 5) - It aligns with my cautious but thorough approach; worth evaluating for potential benefits.
