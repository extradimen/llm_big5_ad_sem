**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad:** Score - **6**: Although I appreciate its upbeat message about staying energized and looking good, which aligns with some of my strong desires (Strongly Agree for being talkative and imaginative), it doesn't grab me deeply.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score - **5**: The concept of a "energizing" drink resonates, but its creativity feels standard rather than groundbreaking.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score - **4**: While I see positive aspects like promoting well-being, it lacks specific details about health benefits or product uniqueness that would make me strongly trust it (Agree for generally trusting).

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score - **3**: The visual and messaging appeal might be too generic to stand out amidst a sea of similar ads.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score - **2**: Despite its promises, I’m hesitant without more concrete information on safety, effectiveness, or cost (Monthly income < 15,000,000 VND).
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score - **3**: There’s enough interest to explore further if it's affordable and well-reviewed by trusted sources.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score - **4**: It aligns with my proactive planning (Strongly Agree), so I'm open to considering the purchase, especially if others recommend it or during a sale period.

Overall, while not fully persuasive, the ad sparks curiosity and might lead to consideration or trial due to its clear benefits. However, stronger evidence is needed for firm commitment given personal preferences and budget constraints.
