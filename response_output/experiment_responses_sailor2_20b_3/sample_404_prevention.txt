**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3)** - While it has a clear message targeting fatigue and appearance, its straightforward approach isn't particularly engaging for me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)** - The concept of preventing tiredness and dull looks can be relevant, but not sufficiently intriguing given my personality's reserved nature.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)** - It’s well-intentioned in highlighting benefits that many people might value; hence I find it reasonably credible.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)** - The presentation may lack emotional resonance or creative appeal, which isn’t aligned with my neutral imagination and originality preferences.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)** - Given my strong work ethic but occasional carelessness, I prioritize practicalities over immediate purchases.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2)** - There's some mild interest from the functional aspect, but it’s not a priority item in my budget-conscious lifestyle.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3)** - The ad resonates with certain needs, so I am open to considering it under specific conditions or promotions.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively conveys its benefits and is acceptable in terms of credibility, personal engagement levels are moderate-to-low due to my reserved nature and preference for practicality over immediate impulse buys. Therefore, consideration without strong intent highlights a balanced perspective from this demographic profile.
