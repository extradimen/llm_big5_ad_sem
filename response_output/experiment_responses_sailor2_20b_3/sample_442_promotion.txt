**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)**  
   *Neutral*: Despite being talkative and outgoing in some contexts, I find this energy drink advertisement somewhat generic and not particularly engaging for my personal taste.

2. **Interesting (Score: 4)**  
   *Slightly Agree*: The promise of staying energized and looking good is a common claim, so it sparks mild interest but doesn't captivate me deeply due to over-saturation in the market.

3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**  
   *Agree*: As an office worker with postgraduate education, I have some skepticism regarding claims, but find this message relatively plausible and not outright manipulative—just standard for the category.

4. **Attractive (Score: 2)**  
   *Disagree*: The visual or overall presentation doesn't appeal much to me; it lacks uniqueness compared to other similar ads in my region’s market.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**  
   *Strongly Disagree*: Given my reserved nature, I'm not inclined towards spontaneous purchases from promotional ads alone.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**  
   *Disagree*: There's little motivation in trying it without personal recommendations or further evidence of its effectiveness.

3. **Will consider buying the product (Score: 3)**  
   *Neutral/Agree**: If I encounter favorable user reviews, discounts, or endorsements from trusted sources, my cautious approach might shift towards considering a purchase despite initial skepticism.

Overall, while not entirely dismissive, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its generic nature and lack of distinct appeal. My reserved personality leans against immediate purchases based on promotional hype alone. However, an external nudge could sway my consideration or trial effort.
