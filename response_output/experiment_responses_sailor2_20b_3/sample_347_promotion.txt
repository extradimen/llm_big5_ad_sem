**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning toward slightly positive; it doesn't stand out enough given my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Moderate agreement, as energy-boosting products are generally engaging but not exceptionally so to a senior civil servant with other priorities.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Somewhat agreeable; it makes basic claims that align with common wellness needs, though lacking in strong emotional appeal or detailed substantiation.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Low attractiveness due to my generally cautious nature and lack of visual interest drawn by typical health drink ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; given my monthly income constraints, I prioritize practical necessities over lifestyle supplements.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree but unlikely; while it sounds beneficial, there are many affordable alternatives and budget limitations take precedence.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning toward considering briefly; if an exceptional sale or discount is offered, I might entertain a purchase, otherwise, my thorough approach would weigh the value against cost.

This evaluation reflects a balanced critical perspective rooted in practicality and personal needs versus generalized wellness advertising. While not entirely uninterested, it aligns with cautious decision-making typical of my demographic profile and personality traits.
