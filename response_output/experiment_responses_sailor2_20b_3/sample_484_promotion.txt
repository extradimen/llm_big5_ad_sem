3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 6) - Agree; it conveys clear value propositions that could be beneficial to a consumer.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3) - Neutral leaning slightly negative; lacks strong visual or emotional appeal.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2) - Disagree; while intrigued, there isnâ€™t enough personal motivation yet.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 3) - Neutral leaning positive; might consider it if other factors align during a shopping trip.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 3) - Agree; the idea is on my radar, but not urgent or compelling enough for immediate action.
