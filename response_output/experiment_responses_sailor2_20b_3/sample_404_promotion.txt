**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: As someone who values thoroughness and is somewhat reserved but helpful to others, I find the ad moderately appealing because it aligns with my desire for energy boosters, yet its direct claim seems a bit generalized.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The concept of staying energized appeals, making it intriguing. However, the simplicity doesn't excite me too much.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: It presents itself as beneficial and non-intrusive; I consider this an okay advertisement from a functional standpoint.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The ad lacks emotional appeal or creative elements that would strongly draw me in, hence a low score.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3)**: While the benefits are desirable, my cautious nature makes me hesitant to commit solely based on this advertisement.
   - **Try to Buy (Score: 3)**: I am open to giving it a try if recommended by trusted sources or during promotions.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 2)**: The ad does not push me strongly enough, but the idea remains in my consideration; external factors would influence my final decision.

Overall, while the product's benefits are aligned with my needs and values, the advertisement itself is moderately effective without being highly persuasive. Therefore, I'm open to considering it but need more compelling reasons or personal experiences before making a purchase commitment.
