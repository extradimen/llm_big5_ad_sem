**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement:** 
   - **Like**: Disagree due to being reserved and not easily persuaded.
   - **Interesting**: Neutral; not particularly drawn or repelled by energy drinks in general but open-minded about new information.
   - **Good**: Slightly agree, as it appeals to a desire for vitality without strong conviction of its effectiveness.
   - **Attractive**: Moderately neutral leaning towards negative because the ad’s promises don’t fully resonate with my cautious and less trusting nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Low (score 2) – Skepticism from past experiences and skepticism around efficacy claims in marketing.
   - **Try to buy**: Neutral leaning towards trying (score 4) – Will consider it if personal circumstances require an energy boost but won't rush into a decision.
   - **Consider buying**: Somewhat positive consideration (score 5) – Open to exploring its benefits, especially during periods of high stress or fatigue at work.

This balanced assessment reflects my reserved and occasionally skeptical nature while acknowledging practical needs for sustained energy.
