**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3): Despite not being particularly talkative or imaginative, the idea of staying energized appeals to me but doesn't elicit strong excitement.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4): The proposition is appealing because maintaining energy and appearance are priorities in my busy life. It intrigues as a potential solution.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5): The ad effectively communicates practical benefits, making it credible for managing both personal productivity and self-image concerns.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3): While the message is good, its overall presentation might need more sophistication or personal relevance to fully captivate me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Disagree (2): Though I appreciate the product's potential benefits, my existing daily routines and financial priorities mean it wouldn't be an immediate purchase.
   - **Try:** Agree (4): Given its positive attributes, thereâ€™s a willingness to give the drink a trial, especially if aligned with health or fitness goals.
   - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (5): The product holds considerable value in my mind and would remain on my list of potential purchases for future occasions when I need an extra energy boost.

Overall, while this ad is solid and aligns well with some of my values and practical needs, it falls short of strong immediate action due to personal constraints but remains highly considered.
