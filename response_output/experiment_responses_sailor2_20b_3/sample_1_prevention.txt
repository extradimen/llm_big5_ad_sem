**Evaluation:**
- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - The phrase "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" strikes a neutral-to-mildly positive note for me. Although the concept of preventing fatigue is appealing (Strongly Agree on being helpful), my overall preference leans more towards thoughtful engagement rather than instant persuasion.
  
- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Despite agreeing that prevention-oriented products can be valuable, I don't feel strong intent to purchase right away due to factors like needing further research or considering alternative options (Disagree).
  - However, the innovative idea and potential benefits make me open enough to consider it seriously (Agree).

In summary:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: Neutral-leaning favorable.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Cautiously open but not immediate commitment.
