**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **I like the ad**: Neutral (score 3) — The statement feels generic and not particularly engaging given my personality traits.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (score 4) — It's mildly interesting, but lacks personal relevance due to its universal appeal.
   - **Good**: Agree (score 4) — While it seems well-presented, there isn't a strong connection or compelling reason for me personally.
   - **Attractive**: Somewhat Agree (score 5) — Visually and conceptually acceptable but not highly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend to purchase**: Disagree (score 2) — My daily routine as a blue-collar worker doesn't require such a drink frequently.
   - **Try to buy**: Slightly Disagree/Neutral (score 2.5) — I'm open but not inclined to try it unless prompted by other factors.
   - **Consider buying**: Neutral (score 3) — It’s on the radar, but no strong motivation drives me towards a purchase.

Overall, while the ad is professionally presented and somewhat appealing visually, my personal needs, lifestyle, and financial constraints steer me away from immediate interest or intention to buy. The message resonates mildly without compelling urgency for someone with my demographic and personality profile.
