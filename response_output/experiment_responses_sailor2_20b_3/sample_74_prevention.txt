**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitudinal Responses:**
   - **I like the ad:** Agree (score 4): While I acknowledge it's somewhat effective in presenting a problem that many can relate to—feeling tired and looking dull—I'm not overly enthusiastic about its presentation.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral (score 3): The message is clear but doesn't captivate or surprise me enough. It follows typical health drink marketing patterns without any unique hooks.
   - **Believe the ad is good:** Somewhat Agree (score 5): I trust that fatigue and dull appearance can be issues, making it a decent claim to address these concerns, though not groundbreaking in its approach.
   - **Attractive:** Slightly Disagree (score 2): The overall aesthetic or call-to-action isn't particularly compelling. It may appeal more broadly but lacks personal resonance for me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Somewhat Agree (score 4): Given my strong work ethic and need for efficiency, I can see the value in trying a drink that promises relief from fatigue. However, it's not an immediate impulse.
   - **Try to buy this product:** Neutral (score 3): There’s some curiosity driven by the ad, but external factors like brand reputation, price, and reviews will heavily influence my actual trial purchase.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Somewhat Agree (score 5): I’m open-minded enough to consider it as part of a routine or lifestyle change aimed at improving well-being. The persuasive elements don’t fully sway me but do make me think about incorporating it.

Overall, the ad aligns with my practicality and conscientious nature regarding health maintenance, though its execution doesn't set off high engagement levels due to lack of unique appeal or emotional pull. I'm moderately inclined towards trying or considering it based on necessity rather than enthusiasm.
