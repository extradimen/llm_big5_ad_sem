**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3):** While I appreciate its straightforward approach in highlighting potential drawbacks without the product, it doesn't particularly capture my interest.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4):** It's engaging to an extent as it addresses common concerns about energy and appearance but lacks novelty or creativity for me personally.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5):** From a functional standpoint, its message is clear and relevant; however, it doesn't evoke strong emotions or personal connection.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2):** The visual appeal isn’t compelling enough to draw me in strongly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** Despite understanding its benefits, there's no immediate desire to buy based on the current presentation.
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** If I encounter it elsewhere with additional information or context, I might give it a shot out of curiosity or necessity.
3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 2):** It will be in my peripheral consideration but won't push me towards an immediate purchase decision.

In summary, while the ad is functional and relevant, its presentation doesn’t strongly align with my preferences for directness over creativity and emotional connection. Hence, it falls short of compelling a strong purchase intention from me at this point.
