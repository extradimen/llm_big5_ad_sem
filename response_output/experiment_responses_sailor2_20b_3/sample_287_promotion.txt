**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (4)**: While not strongly positive, I find it somewhat appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance, which resonate with personal well-being.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The premise is engaging but lacks unique features that would stand out significantly for me.
   - **Good (2)**: Neutral leaning towards disapproval; the claims are generic without compelling evidence or specifics about effectiveness.
   - **Attractive (5)**: Slightly higher interest due to its potential health benefits, but overall still moderate.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2)**: Low intention because my cautious nature and need for concrete proof outweigh the ad's superficial allure.
   - **Will try to buy this product (3)**: Mild curiosity could prompt a trial, but not as an immediate priority.
   - **Consider buying it (4)**: Given that I value new ideas and health-oriented solutions moderately, there is some consideration if reviews or further information justify the investment.

In summary, while the ad sparks mild interest due to its themes of energy and appearance enhancement, my reserved personality, concern for efficacy, and limited budget create a balanced yet cautious attitude. Thus, the scores reflect moderate engagement but low immediate purchase intent.
