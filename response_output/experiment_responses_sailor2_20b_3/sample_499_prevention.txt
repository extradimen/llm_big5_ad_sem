**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (score = 2):**
  - Despite being outgoing and sociable, I don't find this overly persuasive. It feels rather generic.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (score = 3):**
  - The message isn't particularly novel or engaging; it's predictable.

- **I believe the ad is good (score = 4):**
  - While not bad, I don’t fully trust its claims. It lacks a compelling reason to take action.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (score = 1):**
  - Strongly disagree; my reserved nature means that such straightforward health warnings aren't appealing visually or emotionally.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):**
  - Given its lack of appeal and personal skepticism, I have no intention to buy based on the ad alone.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (score = 1):**
  - Without additional compelling information or a strong emotional connection, there's little incentive for me to act.

- **I will consider buying this product (score = 2):**
  - Although I wouldn’t be driven by the ad itself, it might get mild consideration if recommended elsewhere or during future reviews of similar products. It’s not enough on its own but slightly better than a complete dismissive stance. 

Overall, while my helpful and trustworthy traits mean I understand health concerns, this specific advertisement fails to resonate with me sufficiently for an impactful purchase decision.
