**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *I like the ad (Neutral):* While not strongly positive, it doesn’t bother me either. Neutral appeal.
  - *Interesting (Disagree):* It lacks enough novelty or intrigue for my taste.
  - *Good (Agree):* The message about energy and appearance aligns with general health goals, making it believable.
  - *Attractive (Strongly Disagree):* As a reserved individual who doesn't find such ads particularly appealing, I don’t find the presentation attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to purchase:* While acknowledging its potential benefits, my intention is low due to mixed feelings about the appeal.
  - *Try to buy (3):* If prompted by necessity or a better offer, there might be some willingness to give it a shot.
  - *Consider buying (4):* The product aligns with health and appearance goals enough that I won't dismiss it out of hand. It remains on my radar for consideration.

Overall, the ad resonates well at a functional level but falls short in emotional engagement and personal appeal, affecting purchase intent but not eliminating interest entirely.
