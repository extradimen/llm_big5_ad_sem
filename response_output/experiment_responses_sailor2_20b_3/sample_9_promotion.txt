**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4):** Neutral to mildly positive; I find it somewhat appealing.
   - **Interesting (5):** Agreeable; the promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing.
   - **Good (6):** Slightly more positive; the message aligns with health-conscious values, but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Attractive (3):** Disagree slightly; while visually pleasant, it doesn't stand out as a strong pull.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (2):** Disagreement; although the benefits are clear, personal budget constraints and existing routines make full commitment less likely.
   - **Try to Buy (2):** Slight lean towards trying; curiosity might prompt an initial trial purchase but not a guaranteed buy-in.
   - **Consider Buying (3):** Neutral-to-positive consideration; given limited funds, it's on the radar for future evaluation if other options don't align.

Overall, while I appreciate its message and find parts of the ad appealing, my cautious nature and financial limitations keep the intention to purchase low. The product might be worth a try but not an immediate priority.
