   - **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (5): It delivers clear benefits that align with maintaining well-being, which I value.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2): The promotional tone feels somewhat manipulative and doesn't resonate personally.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Consider (3): Though appealing on a practical level, there's hesitation based on my personal preferences and other dietary choices.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Try (4): There’s enough interest to explore it but not full commitment just yet.
