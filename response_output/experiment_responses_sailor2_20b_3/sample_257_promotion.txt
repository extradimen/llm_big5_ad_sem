**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 3): Neutrally agree. The message of staying energized and looking your best is a common theme, but it doesn't particularly resonate deeply.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4): Agree slightly. It's generic yet appealing to maintain an energetic appearance, making it somewhat engaging.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 2): Neutral leaning towards disagree. The claim feels too generalized and lacks specific benefits that would sway my strong skepticism.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3): Neutrally agree again. It has a decent presentation but does not strongly capture attention due to lacking personal relevance.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1): Strongly disagree. Given my neutral and slightly negative attitudes, there's no strong drive to buy the drink.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1): Strongly disagree. The ad lacks compelling evidence or personal connection for me to actively seek it out.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2): Slightly agree. There's a very low likelihood, but the notion of staying energized might prompt minimal consideration if I come across it somewhere else.

Overall, while acknowledging its presence as an acceptable advertisement, my personality traits and skeptical nature lead me to view it neutrally at best without significant purchase intent.
