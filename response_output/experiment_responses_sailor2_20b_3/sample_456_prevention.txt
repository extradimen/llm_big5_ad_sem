**Evaluation:**
1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
   - *Like (5)*: The prevention aspect resonates with my value of self-care but it's not overwhelmingly appealing due to personal preference for directness over drama.
   - *Interesting (4)*: It introduces a potential issue, which is engaging enough without being particularly captivating.
   - *Good (6)*: Strongly agree because the message about preventing fatigue and dull looks aligns with my emphasis on thorough job performance and emotional well-being.
   - *Attractive (3)*: Neutral to slightly disagree; it's functional but not visually or emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend (4)*: The ad nudges me towards considering the product, though a direct push isn't there yet.
   - *Try (5)*: I'm open to giving it a try based on its potential benefits and alignment with self-improvement goals.
   - *Consider (6)*: Definitely adds value in my consideration list for managing fatigue effectively.

Overall, while the ad is credible and aligns well with preventive health awareness, its emotional appeal could be stronger. I appreciate its practical message but need further interaction or brand familiarity before a strong purchase decision.
