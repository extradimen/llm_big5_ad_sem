**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 6)** - The strong emphasis on overcoming fatigue aligns with my need for more energy during daily activities.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - It captures attention by highlighting negative consequences without it, making me curious about its benefits.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - The message seems genuine but may feel a bit exaggerated; hence, I have moderate trust in its claims.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - While engaging, it lacks creativity and emotional depth that could make me more drawn to it.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - The appeal is there but not enough given my tendency towards carelessness.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - I might give it a shot if available at a convenient store, driven by curiosity and the promise of relief from tiredness.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1)** - Ultimately, my consideration is low; other factors such as cost, brand reputation, or further reviews would likely sway me more.

In summary:
- The ad effectively addresses my concern about fatigue but falls short on creativity and emotional engagement for a strong purchase intent.
- My outgoing nature makes me receptive to new ideas, yet caution due to carelessness means I won't rush into buying without additional convincing factors.
