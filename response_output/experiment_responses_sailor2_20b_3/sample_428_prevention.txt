**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I don't dislike it outright due to its straightforward message, my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality mean that I find it somewhat neutral.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The idea of preventing tiredness or looking dull could catch attention briefly, but as a blue-collar worker focusing on physical tasks, the appeal isn't profound enough to excite me.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - There's minimal credibility here for someone who values thorough work and trusts others somewhat cautiously. The claim seems simplistic; I expect more evidence or practical benefits.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - It’s visually appealing, but my generally strong agreement with being unselfish means it doesn't emotionally connect deeply.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my budget and current priorities in a blue-collar role, the need for this drink isn’t compelling enough.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - There's mild curiosity but not enough motivation to actively seek it out.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - It might factor into decisions later if I notice significant benefits, especially after trying similar alternatives or seeing tangible improvement in energy levels.

Overall, the ad is moderately effective in grabbing attention and has some potential interest but falls short on strong purchase intent for someone like me. Credibility gaps and a practical outlook keep scores relatively low.
