**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - *I like the ad (3/7):* Neutral due to my reserved nature; it doesn't immediately appeal but isnâ€™t disliked either.
   - *Interesting (4/7):* Agree, as energy drinks can be relevant for office work and personal well-being.
   - *Good (5/7):* Strongly agree because the benefits align with staying productive and presentable at work.
   - *Attractive (2/7):* Disagree since I find it less visually appealing compared to my reserved preferences.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - *Intend to purchase:* While the product seems useful, my strong agreement doesn't lead directly to an immediate intent but rather consideration.
   - *Try to buy:* Agree; there is enough interest driven by functionality (staying energized and looking good).
   - *Consider buying:* Strongly agree due to practical benefits aligning with my daily needs as a postgraduate office worker.

Overall, the ad appeals moderately for its message of energy and appearance enhancement but lacks sufficient visual appeal. The potential utility makes it worthy of consideration despite not sparking an immediate purchase decision.
