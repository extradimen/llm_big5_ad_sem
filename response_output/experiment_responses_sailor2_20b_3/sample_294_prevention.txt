**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**
   - *Like (3)*: Neutrally like it; the message resonates somewhat but doesn't excite strongly.
   - *Interesting (4)*: Finds the premise interesting; acknowledges potential benefits of staying alert and energetic.
   - *Good (2)*: Mild skepticism about its effectiveness. Needs more compelling evidence.
   - *Attractive (5)*: Generally finds it appealing due to sociability but not entirely convincing.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend (3)*: Not a strong intent, but openness to considering the product for occasional use.
   - *Try (2)*: Possibly willing to give it a try based on its promise of energy and appearance enhancement.
   - *Consider (4)*: Will weigh options carefully; not fully convinced without further proof or personal experience.

In summary, while you appreciate the ad's approach, there isn't strong conviction for immediate purchase due to concerns about credibility and thoroughness. The product is intriguing enough to warrant a trial but lacks sufficient persuasion for a firm commitment at this stage.
