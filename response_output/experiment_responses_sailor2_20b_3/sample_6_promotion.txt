**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (4): Neutral with a slight positive tilt. The message seems engaging but not overly compelling.
   - It's interesting (5): Agreeable; it holds attention due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
   - I believe it's good (6): Slightly leaning towards agreement, as the idea aligns with maintaining personal health and wellness.
   - Attractive (3): Neutral leaning slightly negative. While visually appealing is important, some aspects may not resonate deeply enough for strong attraction.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (2): Disagree; although interested, the immediate intent isn't high given other priorities and personal budget constraints.
   - I will try to buy it (4): Neutral leaning towards agree. The benefits are tempting, but not enough to push for an immediate trial.
   - Will consider buying in future (5): Agree. It fits into my lifestyle goals, so while not urgent, it's a plausible consideration.

In summary, the ad is appealing and interesting, but doesn't create an urgent purchase impulse. I'm open-minded towards trying or eventually purchasing the product based on its promises of energy boost and appearance benefits. However, personal financial restraint slightly mitigates immediate intent.
