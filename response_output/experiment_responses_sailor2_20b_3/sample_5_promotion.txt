**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: **Score: 5**
   - While it is engaging for its energy boost promise and looks good presentation-wise, my preference leans toward practicality over glossy marketing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: **Score: 4**
   - The message resonates with staying energized, but I find some other elements a bit generic without much unique appeal.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: **Score: 6**
   - It effectively communicates its benefits and seems credible; however, it slightly falls short in originality or standout factors for me.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: **Score: 5**
   - The visuals are decently appealing, but my strong agreement to being sociable helps appreciate its presentation without overwhelming interest.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: **Score: 3.5 (Neutral leaning towards Agree)**
   - Given the emphasis on staying energized and looking good, it aligns with self-care values. However, I would need more specific information or a personal recommendation before committing.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: **Score: 3 (Agree)**
   - There's curiosity due to its claims; trying the product seems reasonable if available at an affordable price point within my budget ($36-45M VND/month).

3. **I will consider buying this product**: **Score: 2.5 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)**
   - While open-minded, competing options and personal preferences mean I'm not immediately sold on the purchase without further investigation or feedback from trusted sources.

Overall, while the ad is well-received in terms of engagement and credibility, my cautious nature and need for more detailed product knowledge impact a direct purchase intention. Therefore, the scores reflect moderate interest with room for additional convincing factors.
