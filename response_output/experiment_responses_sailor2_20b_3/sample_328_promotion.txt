   - As a talkative individual but strongly reserved in some ways, I appreciate straightforward messaging yet find it hard to fully connect emotionally with generic slogans.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3)
   - Neutral sociability means while not bored, I don't see much intrigue; energy drinks feel common.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 2)
   - Strongly disagree on being helpful or trusting others implies skepticism about universal claims of "looking your best."

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 5)
   - Somewhat agreeable, as it addresses a need for energy and appearance maintenance, but not overwhelmingly convincing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 6)
   - Despite my skepticism, staying energized is important in manual work; moderate intention due to practical benefits.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 7)
   - Strong agree because of the need for consistent energy and occasional self-care, making it a potential trial item.
