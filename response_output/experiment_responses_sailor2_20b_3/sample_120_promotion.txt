**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like*: Neutral (3) — While the idea of staying energized is appealing, it doesn't excite me enough.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (4) — The promise of energy and looking good has some intrigue for daily life management. 
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree (5) — In theory, maintaining energy levels and appearance positively impacts quality of life, making the ad message valuable.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree (2) — Despite its benefits, I find the claim somewhat generic and lackluster; it doesn't connect with me deeply.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Strongly Disagree (1) — Given my financial constraints and cautious nature, a mere ad won’t spur an immediate buy.
  - *Try to buy*: Disagree (2) — While the idea is appealing, I’m not driven enough by the marketing alone to actively seek out this product.
  - *Consider buying*: Neutral (3) — The benefits might be considered if the price aligns with my budget or there’s more credible proof of effectiveness.

Overall, while recognizing the value proposition, a combination of financial limits and a preference for specific evidence over promotional claims hinders strong purchase intent. However, open-minded consideration remains neutral due to its potential lifestyle improvements.
