**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3) - The statement is somewhat appealing, but it doesn't strongly connect with my values or needs.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score: 4) - It piques some curiosity about energy and appearance benefits.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (Score: 5) - The promise of staying energized aligns well with managing my busy schedule, making it seem beneficial.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2) - It lacks personal appeal due to being overly generic and not addressing specific concerns I have about sustainability or authenticity.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1) - The current budget constraints prevent serious consideration.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree (Score: 2) - Given my tendency towards thoroughness and care, I'd need more information about the ingredients or benefits before attempting a purchase.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral (Score: 3) - While there's potential interest, it doesn't stand out enough to become a priority due to limited income and other priorities.

In summary, while finding aspects of the ad engaging and beneficial, practical constraints and personal preferences lead to low purchase intention scores. The advertisement effectively communicates value but falls short in converting my interest into immediate action given my circumstances and personality traits.
