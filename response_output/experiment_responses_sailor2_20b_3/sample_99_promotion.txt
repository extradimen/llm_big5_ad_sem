**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly negative (score of 3) – Given my reserved nature and general preference for more detailed information rather than surface-level promises, I find this statement superficial.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (score of 2) – The benefits seem generic; it doesn't capture my attention or curiosity effectively.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (score of 4) – There's a basic truth in staying energized and looking your best, but without strong evidence or specifics, I'm not fully convinced.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (score of 2) – The visual appeal or emotional connection isn't compelling enough for me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly disagree (score of 1) – Given my reserved approach and cautious nature, I need more concrete details about the drink's efficacy.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly disagree (score of 1) – Without compelling evidence or recommendations from trusted sources, there’s no motivation for me to take a chance on it.
  - **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral to slightly positive (score of 2) – Although not convinced by the ad itself, I might be open to further research if friends or reviews provide more detailed benefits and legitimacy.

Overall, while the ad does touch upon important aspects for health-conscious consumers, its lack of specific evidence, depth, and personal appeal makes it unconvincing based on my personality traits and cautious decision-making style. Further details would be required to increase my likelihood of purchase intention.
