**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3) - Neutral; The appeal is moderate given my reserved nature and tendency to focus on practicality.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2) - Disagree; It doesn't grab my attention due to a lack of creativity or personal relevance.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4) - Agree; Although not compelling, it conveys basic benefits clearly enough for someone looking for an energy boost and general wellness.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 1) - Strongly Disagree; It lacks visual appeal or emotional engagement considering my reserved personality.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2) - Disagree; The advertisement isn't persuasive enough, and personal financial constraints make it unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2) - Disagree; No immediate motivation or urgency from the ad.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 3) - Neutral/Consideration; It's on my radar if I come across better discounts, promotions, or reviews later.

Overall, while the message is understood, its effectiveness in influencing a purchase decision for me personally is low given my cautious and reserved nature. Practicality will guide any future consideration rather than an appealing ad alone.
