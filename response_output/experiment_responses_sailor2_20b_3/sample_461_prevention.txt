**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (3):**
  Neutral leaning towards slightly positive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat but isn't compelling enough to evoke strong liking.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (2):**
  Disagree, finding it fairly uninteresting due to its generic nature in highlighting common issues without much novelty or excitement.

- **I believe the ad is good (3):**
  Neutral. It conveys a straightforward message effectively but lacks engagement and creative appeal for me.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (1):**
  Strongly Disagree. The advertisement's presentation doesn't draw my attention; it feels mundane rather than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (4):**
  Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable. While I understand its purpose, immediate intent isnâ€™t strong enough without additional incentives or personal relevance.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (5):**
  Agree, indicating a willingness to give it a chance if the situation arises and circumstances align with my needs.

- **I will consider buying this product (6):**
  Strongly Agree. The idea of preventing tiredness is important, making me open to considering the purchase when I feel the need or see positive reviews from others.
  
Overall, while not highly persuaded by the ad itself, it does tap into a relevant concern and leaves room for consideration if other factors align favorably.
