**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score = 2): As someone reserved and not talkative or outgoing, flashy ads may feel unrelatable.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to Agree (Score = 3): The concept of staying energized resonates but doesn't excite strongly.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (Score = 4): It offers a plausible benefit for daily routine, aligning with my values on maintaining health and appearance.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Moderately Agree (Score = 5): While not overwhelmingly drawn to it, its message appeals subtly.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1): My limited income makes high-cost products a non-priority.
- **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1): No immediate need or budget for such an item.
- **Will consider buying the product:** Neutral with slight Consideration (Score = 3): Might look into it if there's a significant discount, but not actively seeking at present.

This balance reflects my practical, reserved nature and financial constraints. While I appreciate its message, real-world decision-making hinges on affordability and necessity.
