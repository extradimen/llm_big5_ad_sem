**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)** - While not strongly disagreeing or disliking it, I find the message appealing to those who prioritize energy and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - It’s engaging enough due to its focus on daily benefits but doesn't capture my full attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - The core claim seems genuine, focusing on both health and aesthetics which aligns with wellness trends.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - The presentation might be too generic; I prefer more personalized or compelling visuals.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Low intention because, despite being appealing, energy drinks are not a regular part of my routine.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - No immediate interest in trying it due to existing beverage preferences and concerns about added sugar or caffeine impacts.
3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 3)** - There's a slight possibility for consideration, particularly if there’s a special offer or reviews highlighting its effectiveness without side effects.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad’s focus on wellness benefits, it doesn’t strongly resonate with my current habits and priorities enough to drive an immediate purchase intention. However, it remains in the realm of potential future interest due to its positive messaging.
