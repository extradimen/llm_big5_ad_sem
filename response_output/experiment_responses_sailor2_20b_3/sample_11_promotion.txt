**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - While not strongly negative, I find it somewhat appealing but generic.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - It holds a moderate level of interest due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, though it could be more engaging with unique selling points.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - The overall message about staying energized and looking best resonates neutrally; however, it lacks specific details or emotional connection for me.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - Not very appealing visually or conceptuallyâ€”feels too vague given my cautious nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) - Low intention; I am in a postgraduate study phase, which makes budget constraints and evidence of efficacy crucial.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1) - Extremely low inclination due to financial limitations (<15 million VND/month).
3. **I will consider buying the product:** (Score: 3) - There's some consideration but not a strong push; I need clearer, credible benefits and possibly discounts or promotions.

In summary, while the ad effectively communicates its core values, it doesn't strongly connect with my reserved yet emotionally stable nature nor address my budgetary concerns. This results in moderate interest and low purchase intent despite recognizing potential personal improvement through the product's claims.
