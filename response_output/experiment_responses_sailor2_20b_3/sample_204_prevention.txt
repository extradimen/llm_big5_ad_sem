**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **Like (3):** Neutral; the ad is somewhat appealing but not particularly engaging.
   - **Interesting (4):** Agree; it holds some intrigue by addressing common feelings of tiredness and dullness.
   - **Good (5):** Slightly Agree; the message is clear, if straightforward. It effectively highlights a problem people might relate to.
   - **Attractive (2):** Disagree; lacks sufficient allure or creative elements to attract me strongly.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend (3):** Neutral; I wouldn't actively seek out this product but the ad makes it seem like a potential solution worth considering.
   - **Try (2):** Slightly Unlikely; despite acknowledging its benefits, there's not enough convincing factor for me to make an immediate purchase decision.
   - **Consider (3):** Likely to Consider; given my preference for helpful and original ideas, I'll keep this option in mind if needed.

Overall, the ad addresses a relevant concern but falls short on creativity and emotional resonance. It doesn't fully persuade due to its neutral presentation, though it does pique mild curiosity about trying out the product under specific circumstances.
