**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (3)**: As a reserved individual with a neutral attitude towards being outgoing, I find this ad somewhat appealing but not strongly.
- **Interesting (4)**: The preventive message is reasonably engaging, touching on common concerns about fatigue and appearance.
- **Good (2)**: While it's informative, the delivery feels slightly over-the-top for my personal taste; credibility could be improved with more concrete evidence or testimonials.
- **Attractive (3)**: It has some attractiveness due to addressing practical needs but doesn't strongly capture my interest given its generic nature.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (1)**: Given my neutral-to-negative feelings about the ad, I have no strong intention to buy this product right now.
- **Try (2)**: There's a mild curiosity driven by the advertised benefits, but not enough to commit to purchasing immediately. 
- **Consider (2)**: If the price fits within my budget and if friends or family recommend it, then I might consider giving it a try; otherwise, other factors would influence my decision.

Overall, while the ad is moderately engaging, its persuasiveness falls short for me due to reservations about effectiveness claims and personal inclination toward caution in buying products.
