**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (4): While it aligns with my need for energy, its overall appeal is moderate due to personal skepticism about health claims in ads.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (5): The message of staying energized and looking good resonates as a relatable daily goal but doesn't captivate strongly.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (6): I appreciate the focus on well-being, which is important for someone in their 50s balancing study and self-care.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3): The ad's visual or persuasive style may not personally align with my taste; it needs more substance beyond appearance.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (2): While I recognize the benefits, immediate intent is low due to current budget constraints and preference for tried-and-tested products.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Agree (4): There's a willingness to give it a try based on balanced evaluation of potential health improvements versus cost.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5): I'm open to considering the product, influenced by its positive messaging and alignment with personal well-being goals.

Overall, while aspects are appealing, practical considerations and cautious nature slightly temper my enthusiasm. Thus, moderate intent but strong consideration towards a purchase.
