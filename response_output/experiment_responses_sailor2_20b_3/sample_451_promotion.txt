**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - While I appreciate energetic and confidence-boosting messages, my reserved nature doesn't fully resonate with overly enthusiastic claims.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - The concept of staying energized appeals to me as a civil servant juggling responsibilities, but it lacks novelty that would grab my immediate attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - It's well-meaning and relevant for maintaining daily performance, though I have reservations about instant results promised in ads.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - The visual or tone might be visually appealing if crafted correctly, but my guarded skepticism keeps it from being strongly engaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 4)** - I'm inclined to try new things that promise energy boosts, but previous experiences and my skeptical nature make me cautious.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 6)** - If there's a reasonable price point and it aligns with healthy lifestyle choices, I'll give it a go despite not fully trusting the ad.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 7)** - Given my routine needs for energy and focus, combined with social pressure from peers who might endorse similar products, considering the purchase is quite high.

Overall, while the advertisement isn't perfect given my personality traits, there's a moderate to strong interest driven by practical benefits aligned with my daily life as a civil servant. The balance between skepticism and genuine need influences both appreciation for the ad and intention to consider purchasing.
