**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards positive (score of 4): While I appreciate its purpose and message, it doesn't excite me personally.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree to a degree (score of 5): The concept resonates somewhat because staying energized and looking good are appealing goals.

- **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly agree (score of 6): It effectively communicates benefits, making it credible and well-crafted from an informational perspective.
  
- **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral leaning towards negative (score of 3): The visual appeal doesn't strongly capture my attention; I value substance over aesthetics.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Mild interest but not high intent (2): As a civil servant with moderate income, practicality and budget play key roles. While the benefits are good, immediate necessity isn’t there.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly reluctant (1.5): The "try" score is low because I am cautious about new products and prioritize cost-effectiveness over short-term boosts.

- **I will consider buying this product:** Open-minded but not convinced yet (3): There's a middle ground; given the advertised benefits, it’s on my radar for future consideration if other factors align better (e.g., special offers or reviews).

Overall, while I appreciate the ad and find parts of its messaging compelling, practicality, budget constraints, and cautiousness prevent me from having strong intent to purchase immediately. Nonetheless, it doesn't turn me off completely; hence a balanced evaluation.
