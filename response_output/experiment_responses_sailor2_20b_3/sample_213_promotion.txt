**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (4) Neutral
   - The claim to stay energized and look your best resonates somewhat but doesn't excite me strongly due to personal preferences.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (3) Slightly Agree
   - It's engaging, yet it feels slightly clichéd in a crowded market.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (5) Agree
   - The overall message of energy and appearance improvement has merit; it appears well-crafted despite some familiar tropes.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (2) Disagree
   - I'm not drawn to its visual or emotional appeal strongly enough, feeling a bit indifferent.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (3) Neutral
   - While the benefits are appealing, there's no immediate need driving me to buy it at present.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (4) Agree
   - If given a chance or during sales/offers, I might give it a shot out of curiosity and convenience.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (5) Strongly Agree
   - It aligns with my health-conscious lifestyle; considering purchase when opportunity arises makes sense despite not being top-of-mind. 

Overall, the ad has mixed appeal—moderately positive but without an intense pull to action, reflecting a balanced evaluation based on personal traits and practical considerations.
