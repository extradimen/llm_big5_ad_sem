**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score = 3) – Given my reserved nature, I am somewhat indifferent but not overtly positive.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (Score = 4) – It piques mild curiosity as it aligns with maintaining daily energy and appearance.
   - **Believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (Score = 5) – As a civil servant who values thoroughness, I trust that staying energized can benefit my professional life; thus, this message seems credible.
   - **Attractive**: Agree (Score = 4) – While not highly appealing, it resonates with practical needs rather than superficiality.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Disagree (Score = 2) – Despite believing in the benefits, my cautious and somewhat nervous nature makes me hesitant without more proof.
   - **Will try to buy**: Neutral (Score = 3) – There's a middle ground; while not eager, I'm open to giving it a trial if recommended by trusted sources or backed with evidence.
   - **Consider buying**: Agree (Score = 4) – Given my generally trusting nature and the promise of practical improvement, it’s reasonable for me to consider purchasing, especially under good promotional conditions.

In summary, while the ad's message is compelling in theory, personal reservations about immediate purchase reflect a balanced approach toward new products. A cautious yet open mind remains, making consideration likely but not an outright commitment right away.
