**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Ad Type)**:
    - **I like the ad**: Score of 4 – Neutral leaning towards liking it slightly. The advertisement’s message seems straightforward but not particularly engaging.
    - **I think the ad is interesting**: Score of 5 – Agreeable; the prevention aspect resonates somewhat, making it moderately interesting.
    - **I believe the ad is good**: Score of 3 – Neutral with a slight positive tone. It effectively conveys its point about fatigue and appearance but lacks emotional depth or creativity.
    - **I find the ad attractive**: Score of 2 – Disagree; while functional, there's no strong visual or persuasive appeal.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - **Intend to purchase this product**: Score of 1 – Strongly disagree. Given my personality (unselfishness and emotional stability), I prioritize practical utility over impulse buys.
    - **Try to buy this product**: Score of 2 – Disagree; though the ad is informative, it doesn't motivate me strongly enough to make an effort for purchase.
    - **Consider buying this product**: Score of 2 – Neutral leaning towards considering. The message may be relevant but not compelling enough to sway my decision without further information or a personal need.

Overall, while I acknowledge its functional value, the ad falls short in emotional connection and persuasiveness due to my reserved nature and preference for practicality over instant satisfaction.
