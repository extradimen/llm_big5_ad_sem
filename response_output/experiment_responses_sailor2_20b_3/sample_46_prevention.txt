**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **Like**: Neutral (4) - The ad's claim is straightforward yet somewhat generic; it doesn't particularly excite or resonate with my personal preferences.
2. **Interesting**: Agree (5) - It does capture a common concern, which might peak initial interest for those experiencing tiredness and dull appearance issues.
3. **Good**: Disagree (3) - The ad lacks strong emotional connection or unique selling points to be considered compelling; feels too much like typical marketing hype.
4. **Attractive**: Disagree (2) - I find it unappealing due to its manipulative undertones, suggesting a negative outcome if the product is not used.

### Purchase Intention

1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - Even though I understand fatigue issues, the ad's persuasive tactics feel excessive and less genuine.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree (2) - There isn't enough convincing evidence or personal relevance driving a trial; other options may seem more trustworthy.
3. **Will consider buying this product:** Somewhat Considered but Low Intention (3) - While the problem is real, I would need additional information, user reviews, and perhaps recommendations from trusted sources before considering purchase.

Overall, while the ad touches on relevant concerns for office workers dealing with daily stress, its presentation falls short in building trust and compelling action. The lack of personalized appeal or credible support diminishes both attitude appreciation and willingness to buy.
