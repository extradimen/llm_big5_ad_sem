**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like*: I lean towards the neutral side (score of 2) because it's a basic claim that resonates slightly but not strongly.
  - *Interesting*: Find it moderately interesting due to its straightforward approach; thus, score is 3.
  - *Good*: It conveys essential information clearly, making me think it’s adequately good at conveying the message (score of 4).
  - *Attractive*: Not attractive given my reserved nature and distrust for quick-fix solutions. Strongly Disagree here (score of 1).

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Given my tendency towards being careful, I’m not inclined to buy impulsively; score is 1.
  - *Will Try to Buy*: Might consider trying it if recommended by someone trustworthy but otherwise low intent (score of 2).
  - *Consider Buying*: Low chance due to lack of strong appeal and alignment with personal preferences. Score remains at 1.

Overall, the advertisement appeals only marginally despite its straightforward messaging, not enough to drive significant purchase intention given my personality traits and cautious nature.
