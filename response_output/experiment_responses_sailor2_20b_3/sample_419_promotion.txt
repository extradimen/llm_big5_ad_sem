**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 5):**
   - While I appreciate its message on staying energized and looking good, it's not overly engaging for me.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
   - The concept of "energizing" has relevance but lacks creativity that truly captivates my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 6):**
   - It effectively communicates benefits and can be seen as generally positive, although it doesn't stand out significantly.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 7):**
   - The emphasis on looking your best appeals to my desire for self-care without being overly superficial.
   
### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 3):**
   - It's appealing, but I wouldn't rush into a purchase; more research is needed.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 3):**
   - If the price and ingredients align with my needs, it might be worth giving it a shot.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 4):**
   - The ad triggers some interest but not enough for an immediate purchase decision; I would weigh alternatives first. 

Overall, while the advertisement resonates moderately due to its practical benefits and my outgoing nature, there's room for improvement in creativity and emotional connection to drive a higher purchase intention.
