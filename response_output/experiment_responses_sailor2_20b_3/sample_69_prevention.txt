**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (2):* While not strongly disagreeing, I find it mildly unappealing due to my preference for less aggressive or manipulative messaging.
   - *Interesting (3):* It holds some interest because addressing tiredness and dull appearance can be relevant. However, the tone feels somewhat pushy.
   - *Good (4):* Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; recognizes a potential problem but could present its message more tactfully.
   - *Attractive (2):* Not attractive at all due to my tendency toward being reserved and not resonating with direct fear of looking dull.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend (1):* Strongly disagree because the ad feels overly persuasive rather than informative or appealing to me personally.
   - *Try (1):* No intention to try it despite the need; I prioritize thoroughness in product choices, which this ad lacks credibility for.
   - *Consider (2):* Slightly consider due to the recognized issue of tiredness but overall low trust and attraction lower my enthusiasm.

Overall, while acknowledging the problem statement's relevance, the presentation style doesn't align with my values or comfort zone. Consequently, I lean toward disliking the ad and have minimal purchase intention despite recognizing potential personal benefit.
