**Evaluation and Rationale:**

**Attitudinal Response:**
1. **I like the ad (6/7):** While I appreciate its straightforward message about energy and appearance, it feels somewhat generic for my tastes.
2. **Interesting (5/7):** The claims are appealing but lack specific details or unique selling points that would captivate me more deeply.
3. **Good (6/7):** As a generally trusting person with an appreciation for thoroughness, I think the ad conveys credible benefits. However, its overall execution could be stronger.
4. **Attractive (4/7):** The presentation falls short of being highly engaging; perhaps more visual or personal stories would make it stand out better.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase (3/7):** While the idea is appealing, I'm not convinced enough by this ad alone.
2. **Try to buy (2/7):** The low score here reflects that additional information or a personal need might drive me to give it a try rather than impulse buying based on the ad.
3. **Consider buying (4/7):** There's some interest, and I would weigh other factors such as reviews or further promotions before making a decision.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates positively due to my personality traits like trustworthiness and thoroughness, it lacks compelling differentiation and emotional hook that might lead me directly to purchase. Hence, moderate scores reflect thoughtful consideration rather than immediate action.
