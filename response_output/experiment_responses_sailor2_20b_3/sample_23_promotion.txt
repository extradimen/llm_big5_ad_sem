**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (Score = 3): The ad doesn't particularly excite me, given my reserved nature and tendency to be careful with commitments.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (Score = 4): I find the concept of staying energized appealing but not overwhelmingly so. It matches some aspects of my desire for a better daily routine.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (Score = 5): The promise of improved energy and appearance resonates, aligning with self-improvement goals that are important to me despite being reserved in other areas.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2): While the benefits sound good, my strong agreement on being careful makes it less attractive overall; I don't easily trust or perceive quick solutions as reliable.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1): Given my low income and tendency towards thoroughness, buying without detailed research feels risky.
  - **Try to buy:** Neutral (Score = 3): I might give it a shot if the price is reasonable but won't prioritize this over other needs.
  - **Consider buying:** Agree (Score = 4): The benefits are compelling enough for me to consider it, especially since it aligns with personal goals of feeling energized and looking good.

This evaluation reflects my cautious approach due to being single, young, and financially constrained while still acknowledging the potential value in self-improvement products.
