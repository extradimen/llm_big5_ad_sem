**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
    - *I like the ad.* (3): The promise to combat tiredness and dull appearance is appealing, but it's not my top priority.
    - *I think the ad is interesting.* (4): It grabs attention due to its clear problem-solving message.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (5): Credibility seems acceptable; logical connection between drink consumption and energy/alertness.
    - *I find the ad attractive.* (2): While it's effective, I personally don't resonate emotionally with its presentation.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (4): It aligns with my needs but other factors like brand trust influence further action.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (4): Curiosity is piqued, leading me to consider a trial.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (5): Overall, it remains on the list of potential purchases based on its persuasive claims. 

This evaluation reflects both my neutral-to-positive attitude towards the ad and balanced consideration for purchasing intent influenced by practical needs and trust factors.
