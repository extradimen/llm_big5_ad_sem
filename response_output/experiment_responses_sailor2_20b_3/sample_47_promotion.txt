**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2):** I have a neutral to slightly negative view of the ad. It doesn't really resonate with me given my reserved and sometimes disagreeable nature.
  - **Interesting (3):** The advertisement seems average; it's not particularly engaging but not off-putting either, so moderately interesting.
  - **Good (4):** On balance, I don’t find flaws egregious enough to consider the ad bad. It’s decent, hence a slightly higher score.
  - **Attractive (3):** The visual or tone of the ad is neutral; it doesn't strongly attract me due to my reserved personality.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (1):** Based on my strong tendencies towards being unselfish and not overly concerned with personal appearance, I have no intent to purchase.
  - **Try (1):** Given the lack of motivation from the ad, trying out this product seems unlikely.
  - **Consider (2):** While emotionally stable scores are low, a small consideration might happen under different circumstances or if recommended by others but not due to the advertisement alone. 

Overall, despite my active imagination and strong agree on making plans, the ad doesn’t align well with my personality traits or daily priorities, resulting in generally negative reception and minimal purchase intention.
