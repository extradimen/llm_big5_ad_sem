**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (6):**
   - While talkative and appreciative of straightforward messaging, the claim about feeling tired or looking dull is somewhat alarming but not overly persuasive due to personal life experience.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (5):**
   - Neutral sociability means it piques curiosity without strong engagement; the idea resonates with daily fatigue but lacks a unique hook for me personally.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good (4.5):**
   - Slightly higher as an older person, I value health aspects. However, trust issues and moderate skepticism reduce enthusiasm.

4. **I find the ad attractive (4):**
   - Neutral attractiveness; the imagery and messaging are standard but not compelling enough to draw me in strongly due to my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2.5):**  
   - Low score despite being health-conscious, as personal budget constraints ($<15M VND) limit willingness to spend on unproven benefits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (3):**
   - Slightly higher than intent but still low; while curious about the effects, other priorities and cost concerns weigh heavily.

3. **I will consider buying this product (4):**  
   - A moderate score; health-conscious yet cautious mindset means I'd keep it in mind for future occasions when finances allow or if more positive experiences from others sway my decision.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive health message, the ad resonates moderately but falls short of compelling action due to budget constraints and personal traits like reserved practicality.
