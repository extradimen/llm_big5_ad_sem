**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** While I appreciate that it highlights a common feeling (feeling tired), my reserved nature means ads don't deeply engage me emotionally (Score = 3).
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** The preventative aspect is somewhat intriguing, especially for someone who values thoroughness in tasks; however, its simplicity doesn’t excite (Score = 4).
3. **I believe the ad is good:** As a person with strong work ethics and an agreeable job quality trait ("do a thorough job"), I acknowledge that maintaining energy levels can be beneficial but don't fully buy into the claim without more evidence (Score = 2).
4. **I find the ad attractive:** The visual appeal might draw attention, given my non-artistic yet open mind to new ideas; however, it's not compelling enough due to inherent skepticism and reserved nature (Score = 5).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Given my monthly income constraints and a cautious approach towards purchases, the ad doesn't drive an immediate buy-in despite recognizing its utility (Score = 1).
2. **I will try to buy this product:** There's slight curiosity and mild intention based on acknowledging potential benefits but not urgent need or budget alignment (Score = 2).
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Despite being cost-conscious, the idea of boosting energy is moderately appealing; thus, it warrants future consideration if circumstances align better (Score = 3). 

Overall, while I recognize the ad’s relevance and usefulness, my reserved personality, budget constraints, and need for more tangible reassurance lead to a moderate but cautious stance on both liking the ad and purchasing intentions.
