**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** I don't strongly dislike it but find it somewhat pleasant (score = 3).
  - **Interesting:** The ad is moderately engaging due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits (score = 4).
  - **Good:** It conveys a positive message, though not exceptionally well (score = 5). 
  - **Attractive:** While the concept is appealing, it doesnâ€™t stand out strongly for me (score = 2).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my financial situation and need for energy boosts, there's some intent but not a strong commitment yet (score = 2).
  - **Try to Buy:** I might give it a try if convenience factors align (score = 3).
  - **Consider Buying:** Though the ad is decent, other options could also be considered; hence, moderate consideration (score = 2).

Overall, while there's some interest due to my lifestyle needs and financial capacity, the ad doesn't compel me strongly enough for a definite purchase decision. The balance between perceived value and personal preferences results in moderately favorable scores but not high enthusiasm.
