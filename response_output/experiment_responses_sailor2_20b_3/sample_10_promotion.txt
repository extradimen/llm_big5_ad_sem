3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - It conveys its benefits clearly which resonates with my values of thoroughness in information.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Slightly neutral; it doesn't particularly attract me due to lack of emotional depth or artistic flair, aligning with my disinterest in overly visual elements.

### Purchase Intention:
