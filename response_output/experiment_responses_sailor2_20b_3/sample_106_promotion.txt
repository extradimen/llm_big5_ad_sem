**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad:** I find it somewhat enjoyable given its straightforward message but not overly compelling (score: 5).
  - **Interesting:** It's mildly interesting due to highlighting energy and appearance benefits but lacks novelty for me (score: 4).
  - **Good:** While functional, I believe the claims are generic and could use more specific detail or scientific backing (score: 3.5).
  - **Attractive:** Not strongly visually appealing; it might need a better design or unique angle to grab my attention (score: 3).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** I'm not fully committed due to the lack of strong personal relevance and credibility (score: 2).
  - **Try to buy this product:** Open to giving it a try but only if there's additional information or offers that stand out (score: 2).
  - **Consider buying:** The idea is mildly appealing, so I'll keep it in mind for future consideration after seeing more evidence of effectiveness (score: 2.5).

Overall, the ad resonates at a moderate level due to its alignment with my need for energy and appearance, but stronger proof or presentation would significantly increase my scores.
