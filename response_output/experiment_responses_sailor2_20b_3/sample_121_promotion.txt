**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score = 3)**: While I appreciate its positive message and design elements, it doesn't really stand out for me.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score = 4)**: It's moderately engaging but not groundbreaking in how it presents energy-boosting benefits or unique features.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score = 2)**: The basic promise of staying energized and looking your best seems generic, so I find it lackluster.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score = 5)**: Visually appealing graphics might draw some attention, making it somewhat visually pleasing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score = 1)**: Despite liking aspects of the ad, I'm not compelled enough by these general promises alone.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score = 2)**: Maybe if it's highly discounted or recommended by someone trustworthy, I might give it a shot.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score = 3)**: It lands in the "maybe later" category; there are more pressing needs or products with clearer benefits that align better with my current lifestyle and budget.

Overall, while not dismissive of the ad's appeal, its messaging is too broad for me to prioritize purchasing without additional convincing factors.
