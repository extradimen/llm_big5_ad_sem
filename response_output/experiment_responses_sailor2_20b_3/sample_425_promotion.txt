**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: While talkative and friendly, I find it neutral rather than particularly appealing.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: It's somewhat engaging but not captivating enough given my reserved nature.
  - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: The message about staying energized appeals to health-conscious individuals, which resonates with me slightly.
  - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: My generally unreserved and pragmatic outlook makes it less visually or conceptually appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Given my blue-collar work, budget constraints (monthly income between 36â€“45 million VND), and practical priorities over flashy products, low intention.
  - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: There's a minimal curiosity but not enough motivation to act on it immediately due to financial considerations.
  - **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Might reconsider if there are clear benefits or special offers, balancing health goals with affordability.

Overall, while the ad is decently received in terms of content quality and message clarity, my practical and reserved personality, combined with economic limitations, dampen both liking and immediate purchase intent.
