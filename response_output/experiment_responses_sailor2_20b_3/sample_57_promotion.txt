**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: As someone who tends to be careful and occasionally nervous but not strongly emotional, the ad hits a neutral note with me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The promise of energy and looking best is relevant in daily life; thus, it catches my attention moderately.
   - **Good (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its message, I feel it’s somewhat generic without solid proof or details.
   - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: It has an appealing concept that aligns with maintaining a balanced lifestyle, which is important for me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Despite the neutral-to-positive feelings about the ad, my strong inclination towards being thorough and careful means I would need more information (ingredient list, user testimonials) before making an intention.
   - **Try to buy**: The appeal is enough for me to consider a trial, given its claims impact daily performance positively.
   - **Consider buying** (Score: 4): Overall, there’s considerable consideration but not immediate commitment due to personal preference for detailed product reviews and trust issues.

In summary, while the ad resonates somewhat with my values of staying energized and looking good, I remain cautious, reflecting a pragmatic approach typical among civil servants. Thus, balanced scores align well with this demographic and personality profile.
