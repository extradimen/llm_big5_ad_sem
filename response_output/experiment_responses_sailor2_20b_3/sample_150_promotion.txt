**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**: 
   - **I like the ad (score: 5)**: Neutral-to-positive response; I find it engaging as someone who values appearances and energy levels.
   - **Interesting (score: 4)**: It catches my attention but lacks novelty for a talkative, outgoing individual.
   - **Good (score: 3)**: The message seems plausible, aligning with the promise of looking good while being energetic, yet it's generic.
   - **Attractive (score: 2)**: While appealing visually and conceptually, my reserved side finds it less captivating.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to purchase (score: 2)**: Despite liking the idea, I'm not strongly motivated by promotional ads alone due to being generally cautious about health claims.
   - **Will try to buy (score: 3)**: There's a mild interest driven by practical benefits but balanced with skepticism.
   - **Consider buying (score: 4)**: The product warrants consideration if it aligns with my busy lifestyle and budget, reflecting my helpful nature towards maintaining well-being.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately due to its relatability as a civil servant balancing work-life; however, personal traits like being careful and not making hasty decisions influence low purchase intent scores. Still, I remain open-minded enough to consider it under suitable circumstances.
