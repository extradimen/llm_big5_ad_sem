**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Attitudinal Responses:** 
   - **I like the ad. (4)**: While I appreciate its attempt to address fatigue and appearance concerns, it doesn't strongly connect with me due to my reserved nature.
   - **I think the ad is interesting. (5)**: The concept of feeling tired or looking dull resonates on a personal level, especially for someone working hard in blue-collar labor.
   - **I believe the ad is good. (3)**: It's somewhat credible but could benefit from more authentic testimonials or scientific backing to enhance believability.
   - **I find the ad attractive. (2)**: The message feels slightly manipulative and not entirely genuine, hence a lower score.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
   - **Intend to purchase this product (1)**: Despite understanding its potential benefits, my financial constraints (< 15,000,000 VND monthly) make regular purchases unaffordable.
   - **Will try to buy this product (2)**: I might consider a single trial based on genuine need and low risk, but not actively seek it out often due to cost concerns.
   - **Consider buying the product (1)**: The thought of investing in such products remains low given my budget limitations and cautious attitude towards new purchases.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to common struggles with fatigue and appearance, the ad falls short for me both emotionally and financially. Thus, a balanced yet critical evaluation leads to moderate interest but minimal purchase intention.
