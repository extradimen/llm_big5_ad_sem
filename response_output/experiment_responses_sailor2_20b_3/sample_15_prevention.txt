**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (4/7):** While I appreciate its straightforward message, it feels a bit exaggerated and might not entirely resonate with my generally neutral talkative nature.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The concept of avoiding fatigue and looking refreshed is intriguing but could be better executed with more compelling visuals or details about the product.
   - **Good (6/7):** The ad effectively conveys a preventive benefit, aligning well with my preference for thoroughness. However, it lacks depth in explaining how the drink accomplishes its claim.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Though I value helpfulness and trust, the overall presentation doesn't strongly draw me emotionally or visually.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2/7):** Even though the ad appeals moderately, it's not compelling enough for an immediate buy decision.
   - **Will try to buy this product (3/7):** I'm willing to consider giving it a shot due to its preventive benefits and agreeable messaging.
   - **Will consider buying this product (4/7):** Given my thorough nature, I'll evaluate more reviews or brand reliability before making an actual purchase.

Overall, while the ad is effective in communicating potential results, further details about the product's efficacy would enhance credibility for a more solid purchasing decision.
