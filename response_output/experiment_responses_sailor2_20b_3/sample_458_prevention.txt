**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (2)**: While not strongly positive, I find it somewhat appealing due to its straightforward message.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (3)**: Neutral leaning towards agreeable; the preventive angle makes for an engaging concept but doesn't captivate me entirely.
  - **I believe the ad is good (4)**: Respectful of its clarity and relevance, though not compelling enough to be outstanding.
  - **I find the ad attractive (5)**: Slightly above neutral because it presents a useful scenario that might resonate with people seeking energy.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (6)**: Highly likely due to my tendency towards thoroughness and desiring consistent performance benefits, despite not being an immediate need.
  - **I will try to buy this product (4)**: Somewhat inclined but hesitant since I don't make plans easily; it's more of a "when needed" situation rather than spontaneous impulse.
  - **I will consider buying this product (6)**: Strong consideration given my practical nature and the ad's emphasis on preventing tiredness, aligning with being emotionally stable and avoiding carelessness.

Overall, while I find the advertisement compelling enough to entertain interest and intention towards purchase, it doesn't elicit an immediate impulse buy due to my reserved and methodical personality.
