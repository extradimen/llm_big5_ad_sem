**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (3/7)**: Neutral; The ad is straightforward but doesn't emotionally engage me.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (4/7)**: Slightly Agree; It's attention-grabbing, but not particularly engaging for my taste.
  - **I believe the ad is good (5/7)**: Disagree to Neutral; While clear and somewhat persuasive in its message, it lacks depth or uniqueness that would make me strongly agree.
  - **I find the ad attractive (2/7)**: Strongly Disagree; The appeal isn't strong enough considering my preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (1/7)**: Strongly Disagree; Despite its message, there's no compelling reason for me to actively seek it out.
  - **I will try to buy this product (2/7)**: Disagree; I may give it a consideration under specific circumstances but not proactively look for it.
  - **I will consider buying this product (3/7)**: Neutral to Slightly Agree; If the drink offers practical benefits and is reasonably priced, I might decide to buy eventually.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive message, my cautious nature and preference for quality over hype lead me to have a moderate but not enthusiastic response. Practicality will still play a key role in any purchase decision.
