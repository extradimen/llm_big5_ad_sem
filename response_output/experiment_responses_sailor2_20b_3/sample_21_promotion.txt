**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad:** Score = 4
   - While I appreciate its intention to energize and boost appearance, it doesn't fully resonate with my reserved nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 3
   - It captures attention but lacks a unique or creative angle that would truly engage me (strongly disagree on having an active imagination).

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 5
   - Its message of vitality and attractiveness seems beneficial, yet it feels somewhat generic.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 2
   - The visuals might look appealing to some, but my strong emphasis on thoroughness makes me skeptical about quick fixes promised by ads like these.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Despite its benefits, I don't feel compelled due to cautious nature and skepticism toward marketing claims.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score = 2
   - Somewhat open to giving it a trial but not highly motivated.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score = 3
   - There's consideration for future use, mainly because it aligns with my values of looking after myself (though I require more evidence or personal experience).

In summary, while the ad isn't strongly disliked and has some appeal, its overall impact on me is modest given my traits and cautious approach to consumer decisions.
