**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3)
   - As a talkative individual but not necessarily outgoing or sociable, I appreciate its message directly addressing potential issues of fatigue and appearance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 2)
   - The claim feels somewhat generic; it doesn't captivate me due to lack of unique features or emotional connection.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4)
   - While not strongly convincing, its straightforward approach aligns with my preference for practicality and a thorough job in my work environment.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)
   - The visuals or creativity don't appeal much; it feels less engaging compared to more dynamic ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1)
   - With a low income and high emphasis on practicality, I prioritize essentials over non-essential beverages that arenâ€™t proven to make significant impacts in my life.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)
   - Slightly higher than intent due to curiosity but still cautious given the price range and perceived necessity.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 1)
   - Given budget constraints, while open to exploring options, I'm unlikely to actively pursue it without concrete benefits or special offers aligning with my needs.

Overall, though appreciating its directness and thorough approach, the ad doesn't sufficiently resonate due to lack of personal relevance and engagement. The low income factor further diminishes interest in purchasing despite acknowledging potential utility.
