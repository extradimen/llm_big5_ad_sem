**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (4/7):** While I appreciate its message of energy and appearance, my strong agreeable trait doesn't make me overly fond of promotional content.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** It piques curiosity with promises that appeal to staying active but could be more engaging given some personal relevance.
   - **Good (3/7):** The ad seems somewhat generic; while it delivers a positive message, its credibility feels lacking without specifics or testimonials.
   - **Attractive (6/7):** Its overall presentation is visually appealing and motivational, resonating enough with my agreeable nature for moderate attraction.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (2/7):** Although I appreciate the benefits offered, there's a barrier due to concerns about effectiveness and value considering my limited budget.
   - **Will try to buy (3/7):** The strong agreement on thoroughness makes me somewhat inclined to give it a shot if available at a reasonable cost.
   - **Consider buying (3/7):** Given the general trust and imagination, I am open-minded but not heavily committed; cautious optimism.

In summary, while moderately favorable towards the ad's presentation, my critical outlook and practical financial constraints temper any strong intention to purchase. The scores reflect balanced interest with room for future consideration based on tangible benefits.
