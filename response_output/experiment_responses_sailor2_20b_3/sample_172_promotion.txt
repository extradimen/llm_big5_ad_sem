**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3):** As a talkative individual but with a reserved nature, I appreciate energetic drinks to stay active throughout my workday, making it somewhat appealing.
   - **Interesting (2):** The promise of energy is straightforward and not particularly novel for me; thus, it's mildly interesting.
   - **Good (3):** While the concept has merit in providing daily benefits, my skeptical nature means I need more evidence or personal experience to fully believe its claims.
   - **Attractive (4):** Given my strong agreement with making plans and following through, an energy drink that supports consistent performance holds some attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (5):** Although the ad resonates moderately well, I won't immediately buy due to reservations about product efficacy.
   - **Try (6):** Given my jobâ€™s physical demands and need for sustained energy, trying it once is likely since it aligns with staying focused and efficient.
   - **Consider (7):** The promise of improved performance makes me seriously consider integrating this drink into my routine after assessing initial results.

Overall, the ad sparks curiosity but requires practical verification before a commitment. My high consideration score reflects a willingness to give it a chance in managing work stress and productivity.
