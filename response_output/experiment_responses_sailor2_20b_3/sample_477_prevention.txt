**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like (2/7):** While the message is clear about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, my reserved nature means I am not naturally drawn to such claims.
    - **Interesting (3/7):** The concept seems straightforward but doesnâ€™t capture my attention deeply due to its commonality in many similar ads.
    - **Good (4/7):** It presents a valid concern about physical well-being which is acceptable, though not compelling enough for strong approval given my skepticism.
    - **Attractive (1/7):** The ad does little to appeal to me; it lacks the personal connection or unique selling point that would draw in someone with my reserved and somewhat indifferent nature.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (2/7):** Despite understanding its benefits, I am not highly motivated to purchase.
    - **Try (2/7):** Mild curiosity but no strong drive; cautious approach given the lack of personal engagement from the ad.
    - **Consider (2/7):** While it's a possibility, my tendency towards carelessness and practicality mean I would require more compelling evidence or direct experience before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional relevance, the advertisement does not resonate deeply with me, leading to moderate interest without strong intent for immediate action.
