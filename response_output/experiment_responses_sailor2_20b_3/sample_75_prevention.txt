}
```

**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
  - **Like (3)**: The ad is moderately appealing due to the relatability of feeling tired but not particularly resonating with my high talkative personality.
  - **Interesting (4)**: Agrees; the health-focused message catches attention, especially for someone concerned about energy levels and appearance.
  - **Good (2)**: Neutral leans towards Disagree. The claim feels somewhat exaggerated without specific evidence or relatability to me as a young working individual balancing multiple tasks.
  - **Attractive (3)**: Slightly attractive; the prevention aspect appeals slightly, but it doesn't fully align with my social nature and personal values.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - **Intend (1)**: Strongly Disagree; Despite some interest in staying energetic, other priorities (like budget constraints) outweigh this purchase.
  - **Try (2)**: Disagree; The urge to test isn't strong enough given the lack of immediate urgency or personal commitment to trying new supplements/drinks frequently.
  - **Consider (2)**: Disagree; While open to considering health products, my current routine and financial status lead me towards a lower likelihood of committing in this instance.

In summary, while I find parts of the ad moderately engaging, it doesn't strongly drive an immediate purchase intent due to lifestyle considerations, budget constraints, and skepticism over universal claims.
