**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like (4)**: Neutral to positive; the prevention aspect may appeal but doesn't excite me.
2. **Interesting (5)**: Slightly interesting due to its focus on fatigue and appearance, which are relatable concerns.
3. **Good (3)**: Marginally good as it conveys a clear message about potential issues without being overly dramatic.
4. **Attractive (2)**: Unattractively presented; the claim feels manipulative and lacks genuine appeal.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase (1)**: Strongly disagree – The ad doesn't inspire immediate action or confidence in its effectiveness.
2. **Will try to buy (3)**: Neutral/low interest – May consider trying if backed by credible reviews, but not driven by the ad alone.
3. **Consider buying (2)**: Slightly consider – Might evaluate further based on user experiences and quality assurance.

Overall, while acknowledging the relevance of feeling tired or looking dull, the ad's execution lacks persuasive power due to its manipulative tone and insufficient credibility for a consumer like me who values reliability over emotional triggers. Thus, it earns low-to-moderate scores in both attitude and purchase intention metrics.
