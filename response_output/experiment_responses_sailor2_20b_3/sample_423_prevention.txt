**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (3):**
   - As someone who tends to be reserved and emotionally stable-neutral but also talkative and sociable, I appreciate straightforward messaging. The prevention aspect is clear but lacks a personal connection or emotional depth that would resonate more strongly with my personality.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (4):** 
   - It provides an actionable message about feeling refreshed, which can appeal to anyone occasionally experiencing fatigue, even if not entirely thrilling for someone in civil service routines.

3. **I believe the ad is good (5):**
   - The claim has some merit, as staying energized and alert enhances overall well-being. However, it could be more compelling with additional benefits or a relatable story to match my personality traits of being helpful and unselfish towards others' experiences.

4. **I find the ad attractive (2):**
   - While not strongly disagreeing, I do feel that its attractiveness is low because it's too direct without creativity or emotional engagement. My strong agreement with "not original" makes me less drawn to generic health-related ads lacking uniqueness.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1):**
   - Given my careful and thorough nature, I would require more substantial proof of effectiveness beyond a simple ad claim. Personal experience or trusted reviews might be necessary before making an intention.

2. **I will try to buy this product (2):**
   - There's some mild curiosity, but the general carelessness tendency means that while interested, it wouldn't top my priority list without further assurances.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3):** 
   - The ad does prompt consideration as an option for combating fatigue. However, in a balanced evaluation of lifestyle factors and budget constraints, I'll likely wait until other needs are met or more compelling evidence surfaces.

Overall, while the advertisement meets basic informational criteria, its appeal falls short due to insufficient emotional engagement and lack of unique presentation aligning with my personality's need for originality and thoroughness. Thus, it influences consideration but not immediate purchase intent.
