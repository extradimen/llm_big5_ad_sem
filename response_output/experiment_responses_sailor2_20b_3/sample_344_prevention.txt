     *Score: 3*

2. **Purchase Intention:**

     *Score: 5*
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly higher as it aligns with self-care needs and seems beneficial.
     *Score: 6*
   - **I will consider buying this product:** High likelihood of considering, especially during periods when I feel tired or need a boost in energy/appearance.
     *Score: 7*

Overall, the ad resonates moderately due to its relevance but falls short on strong engagement and personal appeal. My cautious nature coupled with moderate trust leads me towards consideration rather than immediate purchase intent. Nonetheless, it holds potential for future buying decisions based on perceived benefits.
