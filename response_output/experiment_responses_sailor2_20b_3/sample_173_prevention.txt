**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) – Neutral; I don't find it particularly appealing.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) – Slightly Agree; The concept resonates to some extent but lacks excitement.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 2) – Disagree; It's not convincing or well-executed.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 5) – Somewhat Agree; There’s a basic level of attractiveness, but it doesn’t captivate me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1) – Strongly Disagree; No strong intention due to the lack of resonance.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 2) – Slightly Agree; It might be considered, but not actively pursued.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2) – Slightly Agree; I'm open to it if other factors align better.

Given my talkative nature and tendency towards carelessness, the ad's message is clear enough. However, its execution feels uninspired and fails to convince or excite me as an ideal consumer. While not completely dismissing it, my overall attitude leans negative, impacting lower purchase intentions.
