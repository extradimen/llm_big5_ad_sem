**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (4) - The messaging is average; it doesn't excite me particularly but neither does it turn me off.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (5) - The promise of staying energized and looking good is attention-grabbing, especially for someone who values daily performance.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (6) - It presents a clear value proposition that appeals to my desire for productivity and appearance enhancement.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (3) - While it's functional, its aesthetic or execution might not be compelling enough due to personal taste in marketing styles.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: 2 (Low Agree/Neutral)
   - The appeal is there but lacks strong emotional pull; I'm more inclined towards impulse buy situations.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: 4 (Somewhat Agree)
   - There's a curiosity and willingness to test it if available, especially because the benefits align with daily needs.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: 5 (Agree)
   - I find myself seriously evaluating its potential value in my routine due to the clear selling points about energy and appearance management.

Overall, while the advertisement is somewhat effective for someone balancing lifestyle concerns like mine, it doesn't quite spark an immediate purchase decision but does encourage consideration.
