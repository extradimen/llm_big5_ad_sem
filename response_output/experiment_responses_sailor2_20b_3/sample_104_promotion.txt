**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 6*  
   While I appreciate a well-crafted and energetic message to stay energized, my reserved nature keeps me from fully enjoying it. The vibe is appealing but not overwhelmingly so.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 5*  
   It grabs attention with its promise of daily benefits (energizing + looking good), making it intriguing enough to hold interest briefly.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4*  
   The message aligns well, but I need more substanceâ€”specific details on how it achieves these outcomes might enhance credibility for me.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3*  
   It's visually appealing and motivating, yet my cautious nature makes me question if this attractiveness translates to actual product value.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2 (low)*  
   Despite being drawn in, I'm not ready for an immediate buy due to skepticism about effectiveness without concrete evidence and personal experience.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 1 (very low)*  
   With a moderate income constraint (<15 million VND), my cautious spending behavior deters me from trying out the product right away, especially if alternatives are not explored first.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3*  
   The idea is appealing enough to keep it on my radar; future promotions or reviews might sway my decision positively towards purchase consideration.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad engaging and well-executed, my reserved nature combined with financial considerations make me cautious about immediate action. Future interaction and stronger evidence will influence my final stance.
