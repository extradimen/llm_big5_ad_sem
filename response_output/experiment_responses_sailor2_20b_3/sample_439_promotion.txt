   - Intrigued by promises of staying energized, though skeptical.
  
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)**:
   - Cautious; doesn't fully buy into overhyped benefits but sees some value.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Not very appealing due to concerns about trustworthiness and personal health preferences.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Low likelihood; prioritizing proven products over marketing hype.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Mild curiosity, but not compelled enough for an immediate trial.
