**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: The message seems somewhat generic and may not fully resonate with my personal experiences or lifestyle.
    - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: It does capture a common concern about energy levels, but it doesn't excite me as much.
    - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**: While factual, it lacks depth and creativity to leave an impactful impression.
    - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**: The visual or emotional appeal isn’t strong enough given my personality traits.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: Slightly inclined but not fully convinced; it's more of a fallback option rather than an active interest.
    - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Minimal drive, given my financial constraints and skepticism about immediate need for such products.
    - **I will consider buying the product (Score: 1)**: Only under specific conditions like price deals or when I feel particularly low on energy; it's not a priority.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to common needs, the ad doesn’t strongly connect with my personality and current priorities. Therefore, both attitude scores are moderate to low, reflecting cautious consideration rather than strong intention to buy.
