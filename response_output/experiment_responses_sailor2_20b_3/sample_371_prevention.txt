3. **Good Ad Quality:** Strongly Agree (5) - Effective in conveying potential consequences of not using the drink, credible message.
4. **Attractive:** Agree (3.5) - While convincing, its directness might be less appealing compared to more visually engaging ads.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Agree (6) - Given my health-conscious nature and the ad's credibility.
2. **Will try to buy it:** Strongly Agree (7) - The persuasive nature of feeling tired/dull is a strong motivator for trial use.
