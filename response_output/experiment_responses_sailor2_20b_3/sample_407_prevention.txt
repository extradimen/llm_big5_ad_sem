**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad (4)**: The message is somewhat engaging but not particularly appealing given my personal preferences.
    - **Interesting (5)**: It has a clear prevention angle that's moderately interesting, addressing fatigue and appearance concerns.
    - **Good (6)**: The concept of avoiding tiredness and looking dull seems sensible; however, it lacks an emotional connection for me.
    - **Attractive (3)**: While not unattractive, the overall design or execution does not strongly captivate my attention.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (2)**: Neutral inclination without strong motivation due to a balanced mix of skepticism and practicality.
    - **Try to buy this product (3)**: A moderate curiosity might lead me to give it a try, especially if the price fits within my budget range.
    - **Consider buying this product (1)**: While I acknowledge its potential benefits, I won't prioritize it over other routine expenses or needs.

These scores reflect a balanced perspective that recognizes the ad's relevance but doesnâ€™t generate an urgent desire to purchase. Practicality and cautious consideration guide my responses as someone who values thoroughness in decision-making.
