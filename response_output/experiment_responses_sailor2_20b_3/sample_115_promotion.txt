   - **Interesting:** *Score = 4* — Agree slightly, as it promises benefits that appeal to staying energized and looking good.
   - **Good:** *Score = 5* — Moderately agree since the ad claims functional health benefits while being aesthetically pleasing.
   - **Attractive:** *Score = 4* — Agrees slightly; visually appealing with a compelling message.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** *Score = 2* (Disagree) — Neutral leaning negative due to balancing practicalities against other priorities and potential skepticism.
   - **Try to Buy:** *Score = 3* (Neutral leaning positive) — Open to giving it a try but not committed yet.

Overall, while the ad is engaging and somewhat compelling, my strong tendency toward practicality and careful planning means I'm open to considering it but not immediately committed. The balance between appeal and skepticism reflects a thoughtful yet neutral consumer stance.
