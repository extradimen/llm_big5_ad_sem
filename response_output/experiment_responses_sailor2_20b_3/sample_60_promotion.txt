   - **Good:** (Score: 6) Sees value in the concept of staying energized and looking good; aligns well with general goals without overly influencing me.
   - **Attractive:** (Score: 4) Neutral leaning slightly positive, visually appealing but not overwhelmingly so.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 3) Not a strong commitment due to limited budget and existing health routines.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) Low likelihood; other alternatives or homemade solutions feel more practical for my current needs.
   - **Will consider buying it:** (Score: 4) While the ad is thought-provoking, I'm open to trying it in future if time permits and budget allows.
