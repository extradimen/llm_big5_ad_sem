**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning towards agreement. As a talkative and confident person who values thoroughness in my work, I appreciate the message but it doesn't particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: Somewhat interesting because staying energized is relevant, yet it lacks novelty to pique strong interest.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: Agrees slightly. It presents a clear benefit that aligns with personal goals of productivity and appearance; hence, the score leans positive but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: Moderate attractiveness as it appeals to my desire for energy enhancement and looking good, but doesn't resonate strongly enough due to a lack of emotional connection or uniqueness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score: 2)**: Low intention because while the benefits are desirable, there isn’t an immediate need compelling me to purchase.
   - **Try (Score: 3)**: Neutral-to-positive intent; willing to give it a try if presented with a good discount or promotion, as my strong agreement on following through with plans suggests I'm open but not rushed.
   - **Consider (Score: 3)**: Will definitely consider this product given its clear benefits aligning with lifestyle goals. However, without further convincing factors like testimonials or special offers, it remains in the “consideration” stage.

Overall, while the advertisement is moderately appealing and informative, it doesn’t drive a strong purchase intent on its own due to my preference for practicality over impulse buying.
