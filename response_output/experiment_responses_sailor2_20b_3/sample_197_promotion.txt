**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (Like, Interesting, Good, Attractive):**
  - I like the ad (Score: 6) – The energetic and appearance-focused message resonates somewhat.
  - It's interesting (Score: 5) – Not entirely captivating but has a decent hook.
  - I believe it’s good (Score: 4) – Neutral leaning towards positive; plausible benefits are presented.
  - Find the ad attractive (Score: 3) – Less visually appealing or compelling for me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (Intend, Try, Consider):**
  - Intent to purchase (Score: 2) – It doesn't inspire a strong desire to buy right now due to personal priorities.
  - Will try to buy it (Score: 2) – Might consider giving it a shot if available at an appealing price point or during promotions.
  - Considering buying (Score: 1) – Low likelihood; other factors and past experiences influence my purchasing behavior more strongly. 

Overall, while the advertisement has elements that are somewhat favorable given my background, there's insufficient alignment with my daily priorities to drive a significant purchase intent. Hence, low scores for intention but moderately positive attitudes towards the ad itself.
