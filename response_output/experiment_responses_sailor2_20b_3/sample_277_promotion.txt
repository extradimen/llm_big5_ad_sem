**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - **Like (3)**: I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance.
  - **Interesting (4)**: The message about staying energized is moderately engaging for someone like me who values daily performance.
  - **Good (3)**: While it seems well-constructed, my neutral trust means I don't fully believe in all the claims without more proof.
  - **Attractive (2)**: As a reserved and sometimes careless person, the ad isn't particularly visually or emotionally compelling to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend (2)**: Despite liking some aspects, my practicality leans toward caution. The product needs further endorsement for strong intent.
  - **Try (1)**: Disagree; Given my tendency towards carelessness and reluctance in untested products, I'm unlikely to make an initial purchase impulsively.
  - **Consider (2)**: Neutral leaning towards agree; If the price aligns with my budget (~30 million VND monthly) and there are positive reviews or incentives, it will be on my list of options.

Overall, while intrigued by its benefits, personal traits like reservation, lack of thoroughness, and moderate trust in ads make me more cautious about immediate purchase but willing to keep an open mind.
