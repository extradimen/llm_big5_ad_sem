**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad:** Score of `3` (Neutral)
  - As someone who is reserved but not entirely dismissive, I find it mildly pleasant.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Score of `2` (Disagree)
  - The message about staying energized and looking good lacks novelty for me; it's a common claim in many similar products.

- **I believe the ad is good:** Score of `3` (Neutral)
  - It conveys its benefits clearly, but nothing exceptional that resonates deeply with my values or lifestyle.
  
- **I find the ad attractive:** Score of `4` (Agree slightly)
  - The visual appeal and messaging are decently presented, though not enough to captivate me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of `1` (Strongly Disagree)
  - My current financial situation with a monthly income below 15 million VND makes high-cost energy drinks non-priorities for my budget.

- **I will try to buy this product:** Score of `2` (Disagree slightly)
  - Without strong personal motivation or immediate need, there is no incentive for me to make an effort to purchase it despite some basic interest in staying energized.

- **I will consider buying the product:** Score of `1` (Strongly Disagree)
  - Given my reservations about budget constraints and a preference for more practical solutions over marketing claims, I am unlikely to seriously consider this purchase.

Overall, while there is mild appreciation for how the ad presents itself, personal priorities and financial considerations heavily outweigh any positive feelings towards buying or even trying the product.
