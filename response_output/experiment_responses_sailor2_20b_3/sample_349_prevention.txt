**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score 4):** The ad's message is somewhat appealing to me but doesn't excite or interest me deeply.
   - **Interesting (Score 3):** While it conveys a useful point, it feels slightly generic and not particularly engaging for someone with my reserved nature.
   - **Good (Score 5):** It presents itself as helpful in preventing fatigue and dullness, which resonates somewhat given the importance of energy levels at work. However, it lacks emotional depth.
   - **Attractive (Score 2):** Despite its claims, I don't find the advertisement visually or emotionally attractive due to my reserved personality.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score 3):** The ad is somewhat persuasive, but not enough to make a strong purchase intention given my cautious nature.
   - **Try (Score 3):** I might give it a try if the product seems reliable and affordable within my budget range of 26-35 million VND/month.
   - **Consider (Score 2):** While I acknowledge its potential benefits, other factors like brand reputation and personal needs would need to be considered before making a final decision.

Overall, while the ad touches on important aspects related to well-being and work performance, my reserved and sometimes critical nature means it doesn't stir strong positive emotions or immediate intent. Thus, low-to-moderate scores across both attitude and purchase intention are warranted.
