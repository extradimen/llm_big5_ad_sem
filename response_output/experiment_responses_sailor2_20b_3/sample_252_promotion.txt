**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its intent to energize and maintain appearance, it doesn't particularly resonate with my personal taste or daily priorities.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The message is engaging enough to capture attention briefly but not compelling for long-term interest given my reserved nature and preference for practical information over hype.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: I find the ad's concept valid; staying energized and looking good are important, making it a reasonably well-articulated promotion.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: It lacks the emotional draw or specific appeal that would make me strongly attracted; my strong agreement on being trustworthy means credibility is paramount.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: I'm not actively planning a buy due to existing routines and financial considerations, but the ad nudges awareness.
   - **Will try to buy (Score: 2)**: The slight push might encourage me to give it a shot if there's an opportunity or promotion aligning with my budget concerns.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 3)**: Thereâ€™s moderate consideration; I acknowledge its potential benefits but won't prioritize over other essential items.

Overall, the ad is decently received for its message yet falls short of compelling me to immediate action due to personal preferences and practical considerations.
