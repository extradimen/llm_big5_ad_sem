**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score: 3)**: While I appreciate the energetic and attractive message, my reserved nature doesn't fully engage with it.
   - **Interesting (score: 4)**: The claim of staying energized is intriguing, but it's not groundbreaking enough for strong engagement.
   - **Good (score: 5)**: It conveys a positive benefit; however, neutral emotions about its effectiveness make it slightly higher than negative yet below perfect.
   - **Attractive (score: 2)**: The visual and message don't resonate with my personal tastes or urgency to change appearance.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score: 3)**: I'm open but not strongly compelled; more information is needed.
   - **Will try to buy this product (score: 3)**: Neutral curiosity prompts a test, especially considering the price range affordability.
   - **Consider buying it (score: 4)**: The idea of improved energy levels and appearance makes me think positively about potentially including it in my routine.

In summary, while there's mild interest due to helpful claims and neutral attractiveness, stronger engagement or unique selling points would be necessary for a more favorable response.
