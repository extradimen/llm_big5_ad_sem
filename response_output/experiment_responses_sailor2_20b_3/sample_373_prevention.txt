**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like:** My reserved nature and concern for emotional stability make me moderately favor this ad (Neutral leaning slightly towards Disagree), hence a score of `3`.
2. **Interesting:** While it has an engaging hook about fatigue, my cautious and sometimes nervous disposition means I don't find it particularly compelling (`4`).
3. **Good:** As someone who values thoroughness but also tends to worry easily, the ad's claims feel somewhat general without specific evidence (Neutral leaning slightly towards Agree), giving a `5`.
4. **Attractive:** The prevention-focused messaging appeals mildly due to my desire for overall well-being but doesn’t strongly resonate (`2`).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Despite the ad's message, I don't feel compelled or convinced enough by its claims (Strongly Disagree), hence `1`.
2. **Try to buy this product:** Given my cautious and worrying nature, trying a new supplement without substantial evidence isn’t prioritized (`1`).
3. **Consider buying this product:** There’s minimal consideration because the ad lacks persuasive credibility or compelling reasons specific enough for me (Neutral leaning towards Disagree), resulting in `2`.

Overall, while acknowledging its presence, my cautious and emotionally grounded traits make the advertisement less impactful on both personal appeal and purchase intent.
