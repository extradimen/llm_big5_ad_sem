**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** (4) Agree – The message resonates with my desire to stay energized and presentable but isn't overwhelmingly appealing.
   - **I think it's interesting:** (5) Strongly Agree – I appreciate the emphasis on preventing tiredness, which is a common concern.
   - **I believe it’s good:** (6) Very Agreed – The ad conveys an important need for energy and vitality, making it effective from that perspective.
   - **I find it attractive:** (3) Neutral – While useful, its visual appeal isn't particularly captivating.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** (2) Slightly Agree – The ad is persuasive but doesn’t convince me to buy immediately due to budget constraints and other alternatives.
   - **Will try to buy it:** (3) Neutral – There's a possibility I might give it a try if the price aligns with my monthly income range.
   - **Consider buying this product:** (3) Slightly Agree – It remains on my radar, especially when looking for solutions to feeling tired.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its benefits and appeals moderately, practical considerations like affordability will ultimately influence my decision. Thus, there's a mix of interest but not immediate purchase intention given my current financial status.
