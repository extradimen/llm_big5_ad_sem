**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad (Score: 2):** The strong focus on potential fatigue and dull appearance resonates with my understanding of daily stress but doesn't evoke a strong positive response.
    - **Interesting (Score: 3):** It's informational, so it catches attention to an extent but falls short of being captivating.
    - **Good (Score: 4):** The message is clear and relevant for office workers like me; however, the overall appeal isn't compelling enough.
    - **Attractive (Score: 5):** While not particularly attractive, I acknowledge its relevance as a preventive measure against looking tired.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** Given my reserved nature and lack of strong motivation driven by the ad alone, I wouldn't be inclined to buy immediately.
    - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** There's mild curiosity but not enough urgency or personal connection with the claim to prompt an immediate trial purchase.
    - **Will consider buying it (Score: 3):** It might influence a future decision if I notice persistent issues related to fatigue and appearance, aligning slightly with my need for work productivity.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance and potential benefits, this ad doesn't strongly drive action due to personal preferences and the current level of concern about these issues. The scores reflect a cautious, considerate approach rather than an immediate purchase intent.
