**Explanation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (3):** While I appreciate a catchy message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it feels somewhat generic.
2. **Interesting (4):** It sparks mild interest due to its relevance for everyday life but lacks novelty or creativity that would captivate me more deeply.
3. **Good (2):** The ad is effective in highlighting the problem, but I find the solution overly simplistic and not compelling enough.
4. **Attractive (1):** As a somewhat careful consumer who values genuine benefits, this straightforward scare tactic doesn't make it particularly attractive to me.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend (2):** Despite understanding its utility, my strong tendency towards thoroughness means I would need more concrete evidence or brand trust before intending to buy.
2. **Try (1):** Given my generally cautious approach and slight inclination towards being careless, trying the product feels low priority without stronger reassurances.
3. **Consider (2):** While it's worth considering due to its preventive appeal, other factors such as price, reviews, or brand reputation would need positive reinforcement before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while acknowledging the adâ€™s message is important, my cautious nature and preference for thorough evaluation keep my interest moderate without driving immediate intention towards purchasing.
