   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score 5): Slightly inclined towards a favorable view due to its clear messaging on energy levels and vitality.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score 2): Neutral with a slight negative; feels somewhat generic, lacking strong appeal.

2. **Purchase intention**:
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score 4): Mild interest without immediate commitment.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score 5): Open to giving it a chance if available and affordable.
