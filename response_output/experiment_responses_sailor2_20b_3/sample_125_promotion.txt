**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 5): The energy and appearance claims are appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
  - It's interesting (Score: 4): While it sparks some interest due to my daily routine, it lacks a strong hook that would captivate me fully.
  - Belief in its goodness (Score: 6): Given my generally trusting nature, I find the promise of staying energized and looking good credible enough.
  - Attractive (Score: 3): The visual appeal or message doesn't stand out strongly to me; it feels somewhat generic.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): While intrigued, my budget constraints limit the likelihood of an immediate purchase.
  - Will try to buy this product (Score: 1): The price barrier is significant enough that trying seems less probable.
  - Consider buying it (Score: 2): It's on my mind as a possibility but not high priority with limited disposable income and competing needs.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad’s message, practical concerns—especially financial ones—temper my enthusiasm towards actually purchasing or prioritizing this product. The overall attitude is favorable yet cautious due to personal circumstances.
