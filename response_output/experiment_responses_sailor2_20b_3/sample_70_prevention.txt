4. **I find the ad attractive (3):**
   - The imagery and messaging are clear but not particularly engaging or unique given my preference for originality; hence a moderate score.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (5):**
   - Neutral leaning towards positive intent due to its relevance in addressing fatigue, which resonates with someone like me working long hours as an office worker.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (6):**

3. **I will consider buying this product (7):**
