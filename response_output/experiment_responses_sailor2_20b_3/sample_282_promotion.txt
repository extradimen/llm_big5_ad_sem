**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (Score = 4):**
   - Despite being a reserved person and getting nervous easily, I find it slightly pleasant but not particularly engaging.
   
2. **Interesting (Score = 3):**
   - While my active imagination appreciates creativity, this ad does not grab my attention strongly.

3. **Good (Score = 5):**
   - The concept of staying energized and looking good resonates to some extent; however, it feels generic rather than compelling.

4. **Attractive (Score = 2):**
   - Given that I tend towards being reserved, the overtly promotional tone doesn't appeal much on a personal level.

### Purchase Intentions:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):**  
   - Strongly disagree; despite appreciating its claims, my cautious nature and practicality make me skeptical about trying an energizing drink without strong evidence or recommendations from trusted sources.
   
2. **Will try to buy the product (Score = 2):**
   - Slightly agree; a neutral score as I might consider it if there were specific reviews or endorsements that align with my values.

3. **Will consider buying the product (Score = 3):**  
   - Somewhat agree; though not highly motivated, I'm open to the idea given its health and appearance benefits, especially if aligned with my existing healthy lifestyle goals.

In summary, while the advertisement has some positive aspects that align with my personality traits (like helpfulness and an active imagination), it doesn't strongly resonate or persuade me towards immediate purchase due to reservations regarding trustworthiness and personal appeal.
