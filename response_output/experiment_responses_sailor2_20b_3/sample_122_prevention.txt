**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - The ad is neutral; I neither strongly dislike nor like it.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - It captures attention somewhat due to its straightforward message but doesn't wow me.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - Despite being functional and clear, the appeal could be improved with more compelling content or emotional connection.
4. **Attractive (Score: 4)** - Slightly attractive, mainly because of practical benefits mentioned.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: 2 - Neutral; I don't feel an immediate urge to buy based on the ad alone.
2. **Will try to buy**: 2 - Not likely unless other factors (e.g., recommendations, personal needs) come into play.
3. **Consider buying**: 3 - Open to considering it for future purchase if there are significant benefits or during a need period.

Overall, while the message is clear and aligns with my tendency towards helpfulness and thorough job completion, the ad's presentation falls short of compelling me strongly. Hence, moderate interest but no immediate intent to buy.
