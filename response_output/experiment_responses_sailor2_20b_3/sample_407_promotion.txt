**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While not strongly positive, I find it decently appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - The promise of staying energized resonates well with managing a busy life post-divorce; however, it doesn't excite me immensely.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - It seems credible enough in its messaging about daily benefits, although not groundbreaking for someone older and experienced like myself.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - The design might be visually pleasing but doesn't strike a strong personal connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - While I recognize its value, my current budget and established routines don’t immediately align with trying new energy drinks.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - There's a mild inclination to give it a shot if the price is reasonable or during an occasion when I feel extra motivated about self-care.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - It’s on my radar; occasional consideration, especially around times needing sustained energy and appearance improvement.

Overall, though not highly persuaded by the ad, there's a moderate sense of relevance and potential interest, leaning more towards cautious curiosity rather than immediate action. The scores reflect balanced skepticism with a hint of openness to new possibilities.
