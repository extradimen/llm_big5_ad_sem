**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral. The ad's message is appealing but does not strongly resonate with my needs.
  - **Interesting:** Agree. It piques some curiosity about staying energized and looking good, especially given the busy nature of blue-collar work.
  - **Good:** Somewhat agree. The claims are generic enough to be believed without strong skepticism or excitement.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree slightly. Lacks personal connection due to my practical lifestyle priorities.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Strongly disagree. My limited budget and lack of perceived necessity make it unlikely I will commit to buying now.
  - **Try/Buy:** Neutral to Agree (try). Given the low cost threshold, trying once might be worth considering for its potential benefits during stressful times.
  - **Consider:** Agree slightly. Despite personal reservations, there's a mild inclination to keep this option in mind if future circumstances change or stress levels increase.

Overall, while acknowledging some positive elements, practical constraints and emotional stability concerns hinder strong intent but leave room for cautious consideration.
