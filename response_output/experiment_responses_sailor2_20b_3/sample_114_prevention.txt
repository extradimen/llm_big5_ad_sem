**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes (Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** `3` — Neutral; I don't particularly dislike or love it.
   - **Interesting:** `4` — Slightly Agree; It has an attention-grabbing message but not groundbreaking.
   - **Good:** `5` — Agree; The concept is clear and communicates a potential problem effectively.
   - **Attractive:** `2` — Disagree; While informative, the appeal isn't strong enough to grab my immediate interest.

2. **Purchase Intention (Scores):**
   - **Intend to purchase:** `4` — Agree; It makes me consider trying it out for its claimed benefits.
   - **Try to buy:** `3` — Neutral; I'm open but not actively driven to make an impulse buy.
   - **Consider buying:** `4` — Slightly Agree; The ad nudges me towards thinking about the product, especially if I feel fatigued.

In summary, while I find the advertisement informative and moderately engaging (scoring it around a 3-5 range), its overall attractiveness isn't high enough to compel immediate action. However, given my generally thorough approach and planning habits, I'm inclined to consider this product as part of addressing potential fatigue concerns.
