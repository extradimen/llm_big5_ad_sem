**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Attitude Toward the Ad**: 
  - **Like (3, Neutral)**: While not strongly against, it doesn't appeal much due to my reserved nature and generally cautious outlook on health claims.
  - **Interesting (4, Agree)**: The idea of staying energized resonates slightly but isn’t enough to engage me deeply.
  - **Good (2, Disagree)**: I'm skeptical about the effectiveness without more credible information or personal experience.
  - **Attractive (3, Neutral)**: Not particularly drawn in by visual appeal; it feels generic.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to Purchase (1, Strongly Disagree)**: Given my financial constraints and lack of immediate need, I’m not willing to make a purchase.
  - **Try to Buy (2, Disagree)**: No strong motivation or trust in the product despite its promise; reluctant even to test it out initially.
  - **Consider Buying (4, Agree)**: Might consider if there’s an attractive deal or user testimonials align with my needs post-careful consideration.

In summary, while open to considering the product under certain circumstances, the overall ad doesn't strongly resonate due to skepticism and personal preferences. The neutral-to-negative attitude on the ad quality contrasts with a mild willingness to explore it later but not immediately commit financially.
