**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like*: As a generally helpful and unselfish person, I appreciate messages that promote well-being but remain neutral leaning toward agreement.
   - *Interesting*: The concept of staying energized and looking good resonates with my desire for daily routines to be efficient yet effective—hence an agreeable score.
   - *Good*: Strongly aligns with values of thoroughness; the ad aims to improve productivity and appearance, which I find persuasive.
   - *Attractive*: While appealing visually can play a role, it isn't my primary driver. It lands on neutral leaning slightly toward agreement due to its overall presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend*: Strongly agreeing that the ad is good doesn’t directly translate into high purchase intent given other factors like budget and necessity.
   - *Try/Buy*: I am open-minded about trying new products if they fit within my monthly income range of 36,000,000–45,000,000 VND. Thus, a neutral-to-agree stance here.
   - *Consider*: Given that it aligns with wellness goals and I am considering future purchases thoughtfully (neutral to agree), the intention leans towards consideration.

Overall, while finding value in the message, my cautious nature means purchase intent is balanced but not overwhelming. The ad encourages interest without guaranteeing immediate action due to personal priorities and financial constraints.
