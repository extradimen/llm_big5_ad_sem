**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (4):** Despite being a reserved person who values sincerity over talkativeness, I find the message somewhat appealing but not overly persuasive.
  - **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is basic enough; it doesn’t grab my attention intensely given more complex preferences.
  - **Good (5):** It's well-constructed with straightforward benefits which aligns slightly better with pragmatic needs, hence a moderate positive view.
  - **Attractive (2):** Being reserved and valuing authenticity over flashy promises, I find the overall appeal fairly low; it doesn’t stand out as enticing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (3):** While practical benefits are noted, there isn't enough compelling motivation for an immediate purchase decision.
  - **Will Try (3):** Given that my lifestyle prioritizes efficiency and quality over impulse buys, I’m moderately open to giving it a try based on friends' recommendations or special offers.
  - **Consider Buying (4):** There’s some interest due to the functional claims, but it won't lead me directly to buying without more specific circumstances like needing an energy boost for work. 

Overall, while not dismissive, my reserved nature and practical mindset keep the scores modest, indicating cautious engagement with the advertisement rather than strong enthusiasm or immediate action.
