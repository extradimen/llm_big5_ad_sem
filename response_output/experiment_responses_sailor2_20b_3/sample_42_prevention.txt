**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **Like (Score: 3)**: The ad is somewhat appealing but not strongly so.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It holds some interest due to its straightforward messaging about energy and appearance, though it feels a bit generic. 
  - **Good (Score: 5)**: I believe the message aims for good intentions by addressing potential fatigue and dullness, making it seem helpful.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The ad's design or presentation is not particularly attractive; it seems overly simplistic.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1)**: Given my financial constraints and current priorities, I'm unlikely to prioritize this product.
  - **Will Try (Score: 2)**: While the concept might be okay for occasional use, trying it isn't high on my list of needs or wants right now.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 3)**: There's a mild consideration if future circumstances change and I need an energy boost, but overall, this product is not urgent.

Balancing my values (helpful yet affordable) with the ad's presentation and personal financial situation leads to these moderate-to-low scores. The message resonates on some level but doesn't drive strong purchase intent for me currently.
