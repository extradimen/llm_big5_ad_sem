**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like (Score: 5):** The ad resonates somewhat because it emphasizes energy and looks—key for a young professional.
   - **Interesting (Score: 6):** It is intriguing as staying energized aligns with my active lifestyle, but not exceptionally exciting.
   - **Good (Score: 4):** While the message is clear, its appeal feels slightly generic and could be more creative to stand out.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3):** The ad lacks a strong visual or emotional hook; it's decent but not particularly compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend (Score: 2):** I'm neutral-to-negative here because, though useful, the product feels like just another energy drink in an over-saturated market.
   - **Try (Score: 3):** If it were offered at a discount or with unique benefits not commonly found elsewhere, I might give it a shot.
   - **Consider (Score: 3):** It's on my radar due to its claims and the potential for everyday use, but other options are equally viable.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s message, it doesn't strongly motivate me to purchase immediately. Additional unique selling points or personal connection might sway me more positively.
