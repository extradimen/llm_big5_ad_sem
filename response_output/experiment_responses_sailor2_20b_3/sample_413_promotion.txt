**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Disagree (Score = 2) - The general tone is quite generic and doesn't capture my interest given that I value originality and uniqueness.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral to Mildly Agree (Score = 3) - It's not compelling enough, but it does mention practical benefits like energy and appearance enhancement.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Slightly Positive (Score = 4) - The claims are straightforward; however, without specific proof or novelty, it feels mundane.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score = 2) – Lacks personal appeal given my preference for authenticity and substance over surface-level promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) - Despite acknowledging its benefits, there's no strong motivation or connection.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) – The ad fails to resonate emotionally and does not inspire a trial attempt.
3. **I will consider buying the product**: Mild Consideration (Score = 2) - While I'm open, there's no immediate draw; it might be revisited under different circumstances or needs.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional claims, this ad lacks the personal engagement and creative appeal required to sway my decision toward purchase. The emphasis on routine benefits is not compelling enough given my personality traits and values.
