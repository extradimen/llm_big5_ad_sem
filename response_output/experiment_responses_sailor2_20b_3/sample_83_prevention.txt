**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad (5/7):** The ad resonates on a basic level, given its direct focus on fatigue and appearance which are relevant to daily life.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (6/7):** The urgency implied by "Without this drink" piques curiosity; however, it might feel slightly over-the-top.
  - **I believe the ad is good (4/7):** It effectively communicates a problem-solution scenario but could benefit from more credibility and relatability.
  - **I find the ad attractive (3/7):** While attention-grabbing, its straightforward messaging lacks emotional depth or personal connection for me.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):** The ad's message is appealing but not compelling enough given my current lifestyle and budget.
  - **I will try to buy this product (2.5/7):** I might give it a chance based on curiosity, but won't prioritize it over established habits or other needs.
  - **I will consider buying this product (3/7):** It's in the back of my mind and could sway if there are reviews or offers that align with my cautious approach to new products.

Overall, while I appreciate its clarity and relevance, a higher emotional connection or further proof of benefits would enhance both engagement and purchase intent. The ad is good enough for consideration but not a guaranteed buy for me right now.
