**Evaluation:**

### **Attitudes Towards the Advertisement**
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - I find it mildly engaging but not particularly enjoyable.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The ad's message is straightforward and draws some attention because of its relevance to daily fatigue, making it somewhat interesting.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - It presents a clear problem ("tiredness" and "dull appearance") with an implied solution through the drink, which is logically presented but not exceptionally compelling or creative.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - While I understand its appeal to target audiences who struggle with fatigue, it lacks strong visual or emotional hooks that would make me strongly attracted.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Score 2
   - Though the ad connects well with potential needs, my neutral-to-positive response doesn't drive a firm intention.
   
2. **Try to Buy**:
   - Score 2 
   - I might consider giving it a try if there are favorable reviews or personal recommendations from trusted sources.

3. **Consider Buying**: 
   - Score 3
   - Overall, the product warrants consideration due to its potential benefits mentioned in the ad but doesn't strongly push me towards an immediate purchase decision on my own.

**Conclusion:** The advertisement is effective enough to engage and inform, but it does not significantly motivate a strong personal commitment or urge for purchase. A more compelling narrative or additional credibility factors might elevate these scores further.
