**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **Like:** Neutral (4). While the concept of preventing fatigue and dullness is relevant, it doesn't particularly excite me given my personality's tendency toward practicality over immediate appeal.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (3). The ad lacks novelty or unique presentation for someone who values original ideas; thus, I find it somewhat predictable.
   - **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2). Though the message is clear, the credibility and relevance are underwhelming. As a civil servant with analytical tendencies, more robust claims would be expected.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3). The visual or emotional appeal isn’t compelling enough; it doesn't stand out to someone who prefers substance over superficial charm.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend:** Strongly Disagree (1). Given my preference for thoroughness and careful decision-making, a more convincing ad with supporting evidence would be required.
   - **Try:** Strongly Disagree (2). My cautious approach means I won't impulsively try this product unless backed by trusted reviews or personal endorsements from peers.
   - **Consider:** Neutral (3). While the ad doesn’t strongly push me to buy, it does leave room for consideration if additional factors like recommendations or necessity arise in my daily routine.

In summary, while understanding its relevance as a preventative measure, the advertisement falls short of convincing me due to lackluster presentation and insufficient credibility. I might still consider purchasing under specific conditions but am unlikely to be swayed solely by this ad.
