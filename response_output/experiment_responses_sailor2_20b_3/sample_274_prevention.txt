**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitudinal Scores:**
   - **Like (4/7):** I find the ad somewhat appealing given its straightforward messaging about fatigue and appearance.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it intriguing but not groundbreaking.
   - **Good (6/7):** It effectively targets common concerns in an easily understandable manner, though not exceptionally creative.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** While the message resonates, its design or presentation could be more visually engaging to truly attract me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Although I appreciate the need for energy and vitality, personal habits like sticking with familiar products make an immediate purchase less likely.
   - **Try (3/7):** There's a level of curiosity to test if this drink improves my performance, especially during stressful periods at work or social events. 
   - **Consider (2/7):** Given my budget constraints and existing brands I trust, I would only consider buying it under specific circumstances like needing an extra boost.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates a relevant issue but doesnâ€™t completely persuade due to reservations about new products and personal habits. While moderately appealing, it does not evoke strong purchasing intent without further incentives or familiarity with the brand.
