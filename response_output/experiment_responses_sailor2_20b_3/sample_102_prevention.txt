**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *Neutral*: While it resonates with my need for alertness and appearance, its straightforward messaging feels somewhat standard to me personally.
  - *Agree/Strongly Agree*: The ad highlights relevant concerns about tiredness and dull looks, making it interesting and believable in terms of potential benefits. 
  - Neutral attraction: It's effective but doesn't evoke strong visual or emotional appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - Though I'm not immediately driven to buy (Disagree), the message aligns with my lifestyle priorities.
  - *Agree*: Given its good reputation, I am open to trying it out if available.
  - *Strongly Agree*: The product is worth considering due to the potential positive impact on energy and appearance.

In summary, while not overwhelmingly compelling in presentation (4-5 range), the ad effectively addresses important needs for someone like me. This leads to a strong consideration of purchasing despite initial neutral feelings about its attractiveness.
