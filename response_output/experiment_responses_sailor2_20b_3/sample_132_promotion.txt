**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (score 3):**
   - While I appreciate its intent to energize and enhance appearance, my reserved nature and neutral feelings on helpfulness mean it doesn't resonate strongly.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (score 4):**
   - The claims are intriguing but not compelling enough given my generally moderate engagement with promotional content.

- **I believe the ad is good (score 2):**
   - I find it somewhat persuasive, particularly for its message of daily benefits. However, a strong dose of skepticism from being strongly distrustful mitigates this view slightly.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (score 3):**
   - The visuals and messaging are appealing but not enough to captivate me entirely.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (score 1):**
   - Without a strong emotional pull or compelling personal need, I have no immediate intention to buy it.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (score 2):**
   - A moderate inclination due to its relevance but not enough to actively seek out the purchase.

- **I will consider buying this product (score 3):**
   - If circumstances align or if I encounter positive reviews, I might entertain the idea in a practical way without strong enthusiasm. 

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's merits, my balanced approach and cautious nature result in moderate engagement but low immediate purchasing intent.
