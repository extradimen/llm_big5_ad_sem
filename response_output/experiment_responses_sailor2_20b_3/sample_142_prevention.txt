**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - I like the ad (Score: 4): While engaging and somewhat relatable as a student needing energy, it doesn't spark strong personal interest.
  - It's interesting (Score: 5): The message resonates because fatigue is familiar; however, its novelty isn't compelling enough to stand out greatly.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 3): Neutral but constructive. The premise of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance has merit for daily life, but it lacks emotional or creative depth that would strongly convince me.
  - It's attractive (Score: 4): Visually appealing aspects might catch attention momentarily, yet its simplicity doesn't captivate deeply.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): The ad appeals but not enough to drive a strong desire; other factors like brand reputation and budget influence more.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 3): Open-minded, could be worth trying if convenience and price align with my lifestyle as an active student.
  - I will consider buying it (Score: 1): While considering is likely due to the need for energy boosts, final purchase hinges on better alternatives or promotions.

Overall, while understanding its utility, my personality and context lead me to a moderate engagement level without intense commitment towards purchasing. The ad does its job in raising awareness but falls short of sparking an urgent buying decision.
