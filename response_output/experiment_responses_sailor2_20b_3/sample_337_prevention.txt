**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (2)** - Given my reserved nature and tendency to not find things overly appealing but still acknowledging practical value.
2. **Interesting (3)** - Neutral leaning towards positive due to its straightforward message about preventing tiredness, which resonates with real-life experiences.
3. **Good (4)** - While it isn’t exceptionally impressive, I believe the ad effectively communicates a need that people can relate to—feeling more energetic and alert.
4. **Attractive (3)** - Slightly attractive because of its directness but doesn't evoke strong emotional engagement due to my reserved personality.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (5)** - There's intent driven by the product’s potential benefits, particularly in maintaining daily energy levels; however, it is not an urgent need.
2. **Try (4)** - I am inclined to give it a try as there are no strong negative feelings against trying a new drink for these purposes.
3. **Consider (3)** - While open to considering the purchase, my decision will be influenced by other factors like price and reviews since it doesn’t immediately compel me.

In summary, though not fully enamored with the ad's presentation, I find practical value in its message, leading to moderate intent towards trying or considering the product. My reserved nature prevents strong enthusiasm but does allow for a pragmatic approach when assessing potential purchases.
