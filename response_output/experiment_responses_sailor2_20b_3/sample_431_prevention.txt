**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
    - *I like the ad (4)*: The claim is straightforward and resonates with practical concerns about appearance and energy levels.
    - *Interesting (5)*: It's engaging because it addresses common daily struggles.
    - *Good (6)*: While not groundbreaking, it effectively communicates potential benefits—appealing to my strong sense of well-being.
    - *Attractive (3)*: The simplicity can be seen as somewhat generic; stronger creative elements could make it more appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
    - *Intend to purchase (2)*: Despite the ad’s appeal, I don't have immediate plans since my current regimen works well.
    - *Try to buy (3)*: It may encourage a trial if given as part of a promotion or bundled offer.
    - *Consider buying (4)*: The idea is worth considering; might look into user reviews and additional benefits before making a purchase.

Overall, the ad has moderate appeal due to its relevant message but falls short on uniqueness. My proactive nature leans towards cautious consideration rather than an immediate buy decision.
