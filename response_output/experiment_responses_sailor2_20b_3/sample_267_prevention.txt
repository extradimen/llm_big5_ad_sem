**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)** - While the message is clear about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it feels slightly generic for my preferences.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The concept of fatigue prevention resonates somewhat; however, not enough to captivate me deeply.
3. **Good advertisement (Score: 2)** - I find it informative but lacks a compelling narrative or emotional appeal that would make it stand out.
4. **Attractive (Score: 1)** - The ad does not seem visually appealing or innovative given its straightforward warning tone.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase** (Score: 1) – Despite the message, there isn't a strong urge because other solutions like lifestyle changes also exist.
2. **Try to buy** (Score: 1) – Low motivation due to doubts about effectiveness and alternatives without trying it first.
3. **Consider buying** (Score: 2) – Open to considering but won’t prioritize this product over others with similar goals.

Overall, while the message aligns with my desire for well-being, the ad lacks compelling engagement or unique selling points that would drive a high purchase intent based on my personality and background.
