**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Agree with the talkative and sociable traits, I find the ad attractive in terms of messaging—6.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral tendencies but a mix of engaging promises; somewhat interesting—4.5.
   - **Good:** While helpful and imaginative, it lacks strong emotional stability for deeper trust or conviction—3.5.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly agree on being outgoing and seeing the product as part of an energetic lifestyle makes it appealing to me—5.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Despite a positive attitude, my limited budget (<15,000,000 VND) holds back immediate purchase intention—a 2.
   - **Try:** I might be open to trying the product based on its promises but cautious due to financial constraints—3.
   - **Consider:** The ad resonates with energy and confidence aspects; hence, it earns consideration for future purchases when budget permits—4.

Overall, though I appreciate the ad's appeal and presentation, practical considerations like affordability influence my immediate purchase intention.
