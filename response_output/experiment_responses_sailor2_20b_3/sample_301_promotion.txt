**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (Score = 6)** - While I appreciate its intention to promote energy and appearance, it seems geared more towards younger or perhaps high-income demographics.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score = 5)** - It holds some intrigue but might not fully resonate due to my focus on practical needs rather than aesthetics.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score = 4)** - The message is clear, but it lacks specific appeal for someone in a blue-collar job focusing on reliability and everyday value.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score = 3)** - Visually appealing elements might grab attention initially, but the core benefits don't align strongly with my priorities.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score = 2)** - Not high motivation due to perceived relevance and immediate needs not being met.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score = 1)** - Low likelihood as everyday functional drinks are more critical for my lifestyle.
- **I will consider buying it. (Score = 3)** - It may enter consideration if there's a discount, limited-time offer, or feedback from trusted peers.

In summary, while the advertisement is decent and somewhat engaging, its appeal falls short of convincingly influencing me to make an immediate purchase given my practical outlook on life and priorities as a blue-collar worker. However, it does keep the option open for future consideration under specific circumstances.
