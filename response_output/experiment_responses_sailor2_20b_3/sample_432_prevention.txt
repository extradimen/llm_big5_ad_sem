**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 4)**: The ad's message is clear but not particularly engaging for me. It feels somewhat generic.
    - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: There’s a hint of urgency with "may feel tired and look dull," which piques mild interest, given my need to stay alert in my role as a civil servant.
    - **Good (Score: 6)**: The ad presents a solution-driven message effectively, targeting fatigue issues relevant to daily life but not overly exaggerated or manipulative.
    - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While it has some appeal, the overall design and tone need improvement for stronger visual attraction. It doesn’t stand out enough for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to Purchase**: At a score of 2, I'm not strongly motivated just based on this ad alone. The message resonates but lacks compelling details about efficacy or brand trust.
    - **Will Try to Buy**: Score of 2 indicates that while the concept is decent, additional information (like ingredients, reviews) would be necessary before attempting a purchase.
    - **Will Consider Buying**: At 3, there's room for contemplation. It’s on my radar due to its relevance but not enough push without more research or personal endorsement.

In summary, though I appreciate the ad’s straightforward approach and preventive messaging, it doesn't significantly influence an immediate decision to buy. Additional details about the product and possibly a more compelling narrative would improve persuasion. Thus, there's moderate interest with cautious consideration for future purchase intent.
