**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 4): The premise seems somewhat relatable but isn't extremely engaging.
  - It's interesting (Score: 5): The concept of feeling tired and looking dull might grab my attention briefly, making it moderately intriguing.
  - Believe the ad is good (Score: 6): Given its straightforward messaging targeting common feelings, I find some credibility here.
  - Find the ad attractive (Score: 3): While not unappealing, the simplicity lacks a strong emotional draw for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intent to purchase this product (Score: 2): The appeal is minimal; it doesn't strongly motivate immediate action.
  - Will try to buy this product (Score: 1): I'm unlikely to take initiative based on the ad alone.
  - Consider buying the product (Score: 2): There's mild consideration, especially if prompted by other factors or personal experience.

Overall, while understanding its message and finding some merit in it, my high sociability and talkativeness aren't enough to make me excited about purchasing. The balance between credibility and emotional resonance is lacking for a strong purchase intention from this ad alone.
