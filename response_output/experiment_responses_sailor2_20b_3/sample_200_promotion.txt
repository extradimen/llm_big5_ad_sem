**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  *I like the ad (3):* The message resonates somewhat but not strongly.
  *Interesting (4):* It catches my attention for a moment due to its claims of energy and appearance benefits. 
  *Good (2):* While I appreciate the idea, there are several doubts regarding credibility—especially given personal experience with such products being overpromised.
  *Attractive (3):* The overall appeal is moderate; it doesn't strongly draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  *Intend to purchase (1):* Strongly disagree. Despite my practical needs, I'm skeptical about the product's effectiveness without more reliable proof or personal reviews from trusted sources.
  *Try to buy (1):* Also unlikely; given past disappointments with similar products and budget constraints, trying it isn't a priority.
  *Consider buying (2):* A slight possibility—primarily if there are cost-effective options available, but cautious consideration is needed.

In summary, the ad holds limited appeal due to my skepticism towards health/beauty claims and practical concerns about efficacy. While interested initially, my low purchase intention scores reflect caution based on personal experience and budget limitations.
