**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (Score 3):** While the ad seems alright and not off-putting, it doesn't excite me much.
  - **Interesting (Score 4):** The message is somewhat interesting because staying energized and looking good are relevant to daily life.
  - **Good (Score 2):** It's average; the claims seem plausible but aren't compelling enough on their own.
  - **Attractive (Score 5):** Thereâ€™s an appealing element in promoting energy and appearance, which resonates at a basic level.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score 1):** Strongly disagree. Despite the ad's messages, I'm not convinced enough by its claims.
  - **Will Try to Buy (Score 2):** Disagree but slightly open-minded; might give it a try if recommended by others or in an impulse moment.
  - **Consider Buying (Score 3):** Neutral/Neutral Positive. The product is on my radar, but not at the top of priorities given other financial constraints and uncertainty about effectiveness.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's straightforward appeal to practical needs, it falls short for me due to skepticism about its benefits relative to budget limitations and personal hesitation in new purchases. Hence, a cautious approach with low to moderate intention to buy.
