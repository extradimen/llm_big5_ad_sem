**Explanation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like**: While I don't have a strong affinity for this type of health-focused ad (Strongly Disagree), it's moderately enjoyable given its straightforward messaging (Score: 4).
2. **Interesting**: The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it intriguing enough to hold my attention (Score: 5).
3. **Good**: It effectively highlights a common problem but lacks compelling evidence or innovative solutions that would elevate it as exceptionally good advertising (Score: 3).
4. **Attractive**: Despite the message being relevant, I find the ad's overall appeal quite average due to its typical health drink marketing tone (Score: 2).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend**: Given my awareness of fatigue and appearance issues but personal preference for thorough research before purchases (Strongly Disagree), there is a modest intention driven by the potential benefits (Score: 4).
2. **Try**: Iâ€™m open to giving it a try if I see genuine improvement or recommendations from peers, balancing convenience with caution (Score: 4).
3. **Consider**: The ad stimulates consideration because it addresses everyday concerns without pushing overly aggressively; thus, it sits in the back of my mind as an option for future use (Score: 6).

In summary, while not highly engaging, the advertisement resonates moderately by addressing a common concern and nudging towards cautious evaluation rather than immediate purchase.
