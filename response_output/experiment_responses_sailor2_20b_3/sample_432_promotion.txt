**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude:** 
   - **Like the Ad (Neutral)**: While I find parts of it appealing, my reserved nature means I don't feel an immediate strong connection.
   - **Interesting (Agree)**: The concept resonates well as energy and appearance are important for a civil servant's daily performance.
   - **Good (Strongly Agree)**: It clearly highlights practical benefits which align with health-consciousness and self-care, valuable traits for me.
   - **Attractive (Disagree)**: The ad might not be visually appealing enough to strongly draw my attention; it needs more creativity.

2. **Purchase Intention:** 
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral due to cautious nature but open-minded about trying new things that align with wellness goals.
   - **Try to Buy**: Likely, as Iâ€™m health-conscious and willing to experiment with products promising energy and better appearance.
   - **Consider Buying**: High intention (5/7) because it's consistent with my values of productivity and self-improvement despite needing more credible evidence.

In summary, while the ad is moderately engaging and aligns well with my lifestyle needs, I find room for improvement in visual appeal and credibility. This balanced assessment leads to a neutral-to-positive overall attitude towards purchasing intent.
