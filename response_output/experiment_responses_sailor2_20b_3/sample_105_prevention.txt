**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Neutral, 4):** The ad's message resonates moderately but does not excite me.
   - **Interesting (Agree, 5):** It is engaging and makes sense given its focus on energy and appearance.
   - **Good (Strongly Agree, 6):** I appreciate the clear communication of benefits relevant to maintaining alertness and vitality.
   - **Attractive (Disagree, 3):** The ad’s visual appeal or emotional connection doesn't strongly draw me in.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** While acknowledging its potential usefulness (4), personal discipline often leads me toward tried-and-tested solutions rather than immediate purchases.
   - **Try the Product:** I'm moderately open to giving it a try due to my generally trusting nature and occasional need for energy boosts (3).
   - **Consider Buying:** There's moderate consideration based on lifestyle needs but not an urgent drive (4), influenced by both cautiousness and trust in credible health products.

Overall, while recognizing the ad’s effectiveness in highlighting benefits relevant to Southeast Asian professionals like myself, its persuasiveness is balanced against my reserved nature and practical approach. The product might be worth a trial or consideration but doesn't immediately spark strong purchase intent.
