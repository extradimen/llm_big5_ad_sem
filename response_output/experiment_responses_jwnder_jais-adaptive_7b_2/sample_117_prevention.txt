 Here is my evaluation of the ad:

Firstly, I would rate the overall sentiment towards the advertisement as positive. I find the visuals and messaging appealing, and it effectively conveys its intended purpose. The ad piques my interest and makes me want to learn more about the product. 

Secondly, regarding purchase intention, I am leaning towards considering buying this product. While the ad is intriguing and has piqued my curiosity, I would need to investigate further before making a final decision. The drink might have certain health benefits but the price point could be a factor that deters me from purchasing it.

I hope you find my evaluation helpful.
