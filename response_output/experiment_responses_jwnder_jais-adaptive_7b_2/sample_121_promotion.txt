 Here is the code for this problem:\n```python
def solve(self):
    attitude_score = float('-inf')
    purchase_intention_score = 0.5
    ad_type = 'promotion'
    ad_attitude_scores = ['I like', 'I think the ad is interesting', 'I believe the ad is good', 'I find the ad attractive']
    purchase_intention_scores = ['I intend to purchase this product', 'I will try to buy this product', 'I will consider buying this product']
    for i in range(len(ad_attitude_scores)):
        score = self.evaluate_personality_trait('Advertisement', 'I am ' + ad_attitude_scores[i])
        if score > attitude_score:
            attitude_score = score
    for i in range(len(purchase_intention_scores)):
        score = self.evaluate_personality_trait('Advertisement', 'I will ' + purchase_intention_scores[i])
