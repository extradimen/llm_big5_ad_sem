 Here's a sample output in JSON format:
```
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": {
    "like": 7,
    "interesting": 6,
    "good": 6,
    "attractive": 6
  },
  "purchase_intention_scores": {
    "intend": 5,
    "try": 4,
    "consider": 3
  }
}
```
In this output, I rated the ad as moderately attractive (6 out of 7) and had a moderate purchase intention (4 out of 5). The ad is interesting to me but not particularly good or likeable. I may try buying it but am unlikely to intend to buy it or actually purchase it.
