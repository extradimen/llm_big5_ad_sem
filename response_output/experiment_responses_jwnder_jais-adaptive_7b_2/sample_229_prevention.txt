 The advertisement for the drink is very persuasive. It uses emotional appeals such as tiredness and dullness to make people feel the need for the product. Additionally, it portrays a solution that would be beneficial to consumers, which makes me like and find it interesting. However, I'm not sure if the ad is good or attractive because it seems manipulative in some ways. Furthermore, there are other products on the market that can help people feel energetic without consuming this particular drink. Therefore, while I do believe this ad might influence my purchase decision if I were an ideal consumer with these traits, right now I am not planning to buy this product.
