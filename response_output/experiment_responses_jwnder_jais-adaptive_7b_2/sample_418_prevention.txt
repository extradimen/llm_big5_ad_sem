 The advertisement is not relevant to me as it targets people who are already tired and dull. Therefore, I cannot relate to the message of this ad. As a result, I have strong disagreements with all three statements: "I like the ad," "I think the ad is interesting," and "I believe the ad is good." My score for this ad would be (1,1,1).

I don't plan on purchasing the product anytime soon. I am only mildly interested in trying it but won't go out of my way to buy it. Therefore, I have neutral scores for "I intend to purchase this product," "I will try to buy this product" and "I will consider buying this product." My score would be (2,3,3).
