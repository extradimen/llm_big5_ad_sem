 The ad is not relevant to me and does not appeal to me. I would not buy the product, so I rate it as low: 1 = strongly disagree.\nAs for my attitudes toward the advertisement, I find it unattractive and unappealing, so I rate it as low: 1 = strongly disagree.

However, if someone else finds this ad persuasive or helpful, they might want to buy the product and score it higher than me.
