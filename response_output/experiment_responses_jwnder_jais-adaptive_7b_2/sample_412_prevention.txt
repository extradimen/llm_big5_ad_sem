As someone with your unique background and personality, evaluate the ad as if you were a real person or ideal consumer. Different people respond to ads differently based on their traits. Some may find them persuasive, others may find them unappealing or even manipulative.

ðŸ‘‰ You are encouraged to be honest and **critical**. It's perfectly fine to give **low scores** if the ad doesn't resonate with you, feels irrelevant, or lacks credibility.

Also note: 
- **You may like the ad but still not want to buy the product.**
- **You may dislike the ad but still consider buying it.**
Please score each question separately and thoughtfully.
