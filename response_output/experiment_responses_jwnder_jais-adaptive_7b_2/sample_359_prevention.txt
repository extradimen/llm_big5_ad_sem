 The ad has a message that it can help consumers feel energized and vibrant. However, there are no specifics about the product itself or how it works to achieve these effects. Therefore, I would rate my attitude toward this ad as "3" (good) because it is interesting but lacks details on the benefits of using this drink.

The purchase intention score would also be a "3" (consider), as while I find the ad attractive, I have no specific reason to believe that purchasing this product will help me feel energized or vibrant. I could try it out if someone else buys it first and recommends it positively.
