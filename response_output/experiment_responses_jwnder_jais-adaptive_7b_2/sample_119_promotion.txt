 Here's an example of how I might respond to the prompt:
```
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
In this example, I would rate the ad positively overall, with a strong belief that it's good and finding it attractive. However, my purchase intention is lower, indicating that while I think the product looks interesting, I may not necessarily intend to buy it or try to do so.
