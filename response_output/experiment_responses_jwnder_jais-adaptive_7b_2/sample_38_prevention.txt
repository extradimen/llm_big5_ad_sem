 {"ad_type":"prevention","ad_attitude_scores":["1","3","5","4"],"purchase_intention_scores":["2","3","3"]}\n\nBased on your demographic profile, you are a civil servant in your 40s with a Bachelor's degree and an annual income of over 46 million VND. You are also a male who is talkative, outgoing, and sociable, but not necessarily helpful or unselfish with others. Additionally, you are somewhat trusting, sometimes rude to others, careless in some situations, nervous easily, worrisome, emotionally stable, creatively inclined, original, and come up with new ideas.

As an individual with these traits and characteristics, the ad's message about being tired and looking dull after not consuming the product may not have much appeal for you. While it is true that this particular drink may give you energy to perform better at your job as a civil servant or provide more time to socialize with friends, its claim of enhancing overall well-being and appearance seems somewhat vague and unconvincing.

Therefore, you may believe that the ad is interesting because it highlights the negative consequences of not consuming this product, but find it less persuasive overall due to its lack of credibility or scientific evidence supporting its claims. As a result, your purchase intention score reflects this discrepancy in perceptions; while you may intend to try out this drink someday, you will probably only consider buying it instead of committing to purchasing it right away.

In conclusion, the ad may not resonate with you as much as other people due to its focus on energy and performance rather than health or appearance benefits, which are more closely aligned with your values and concerns as an individual.
