 The ad is trying to convince people that they will feel tired and dull if they don't drink the product. This seems like a manipulative tactic to me, so I disagree with it. The ad itself isn't very interesting or attractive either; in fact, it makes me feel uncomfortable because of how blatantly it tries to sell something that people might not need or want. Therefore, my attitude towards this advertisement is negative (score 1). In addition, based on what I saw in the ad, I don't think I would be interested in buying this product even if I did feel tired and dull (scores 3-5 for purchase intention). Overall, this ad was unappealing to me so I give it a low score overall.
