 Here's an example of how you can format your JSON response:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": {
    "like": 6,
    "interesting": 5,
    "good": 7,
    "attractive": 6
  },
  "purchase_intention_scores": {
    "intend": 4,
    "try": 5,
    "consider": 3
  }
}
This JSON shows that you have a positive attitude towards the ad, finding it likeable, interesting, and good. However, your purchase intention is lower, with only a moderate level of interest in buying the product.
