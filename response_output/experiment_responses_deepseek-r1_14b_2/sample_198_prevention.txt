Okay, let me try to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given profile. So first, I need to understand the ad: it's saying that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. That sounds like it's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable.

Looking at my demographic info, I'm a 60+ year old Chinese woman living with my parents. I have a high school education and work as a civil servant with a monthly income over 46 million VND. My personality traits are mixed; some make me more reserved and helpful, but others like being sometimes rude or careless.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - Hmm, since I'm reserved, maybe I don't find ads too exciting. But the message is about feeling tired and looking dull, which might resonate if I want to stay active. Not sure if it's enough for me to like it, but neutral seems okay.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The idea of staying energized could be appealing, especially with my age. Maybe it's somewhat interesting, so a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - I'm skeptical about ads making strong claims. It feels a bit too direct and maybe manipulative, so not sure if I trust it, but neutral again.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Since I'm not very outgoing or talkative, the ad's message might not strongly attract me. Maybe a 2 on this one.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My tendency to worry and get nervous makes me cautious about new products. Plus, I don't make thorough plans, so maybe I'm not convinced enough to intend buying it, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Similar hesitation as above; without a strong belief in the ad, trying it might be low on my list, another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - On the other hand, the idea of staying energetic is appealing, so considering it would be a bit higher, maybe a 4.

Overall, I'm not too sold on the ad, but there's some consideration there.
