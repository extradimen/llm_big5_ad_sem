Okay, let's break down how I arrived at my scores for the advertisement. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (4/7)**  
   The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. While these are positive points, the phrasing feels a bit generic and overused. As someone who values originality and new ideas, I appreciate creativity more than clichés. However, it's not outright dislike, so a 4 seems fair.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (5/7)**  
   The message touches on two key benefits: energy and appearance. These are relevant to many people, especially those with busy lifestyles. It's not groundbreaking but still engaging enough for a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**  
   While the ad effectively communicates its message, it lacks depth or unique selling points that would make it stand out. Without more specifics on how the drink achieves these benefits, my belief in the ad's quality is moderate.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**  
   The visual and emotional appeal of looking good and having energy can be compelling. However, without seeing the actual visuals or hearing the tone, it's hard to rate higher than a 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   My current lifestyle doesn't leave me feeling the need for an extra energy drink, especially since I'm already managing my schedule effectively. Without a strong personal need or compelling reason, my intent isn't high.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   If the ad generates enough curiosity and if the product is conveniently available, I might consider trying it once. It's not a must-have, but it's possible under certain circumstances.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The benefits mentioned are appealing on some levels—everyone wants to look their best and stay energized. If the product is recommended by others or if there's a promotion, I would likely give it serious consideration.
