Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese civil servant would react to the ad. Let's break it down.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting people who want to stay energized and presentable. The guy is 50-59, married, a postgraduate civil servant with a decent income. He probably has high standards and might be concerned about his image.

Looking at his personality traits:

He's talkative (strongly agrees), which means he enjoys social interactions. But he's reserved (also strongly agrees). That seems conflicting—maybe he's selective in who he talks to or situations he engages in. Outgoing is neutral, so not too much there.

Helpful and unselfish? He disagrees, so maybe he's more self-centered or less into helping others. Trusting—he's strongly agreeable, which might make him open to the ad's message. Sometimes rude? Disagrees, so polite perhaps. Thorough job—strongly agrees, so attention to detail is important.

Makes plans and follows through—agree, so he's goal-oriented. Careless? Strongly disagrees; he’s careful. Gets nervous easily—neutral. Worry a lot? Disagrees. Emotionally stable? Strongly disagrees—he might be more volatile or stressed. Active imagination? Strongly disagrees. Original ideas? Neutral. Artistic interests? Strongly agrees to having few.

So, he's detail-oriented, follows through on plans, not very trusting (but actually is), maybe a bit reserved but talkative in the right settings. He doesn't care much about being helpful or unselfish and might be more focused on his own needs.

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. For someone who values social interactions (since he’s talkative and outgoing), staying energized and presentable would be important. It plays into his desire to maintain a good image, especially in professional settings as a civil servant.

He might appreciate that the ad emphasizes not feeling tired, which ties into his need for thoroughness and following through on tasks without getting exhausted. Being careful, he'd look for products that genuinely help, so if this drink is seen as effective, it could appeal to him.

But he's emotionally unstable and has few artistic interests. The ad might not connect with him on an emotional level since the message isn't very imaginative or original. It’s straightforward—prevent tiredness and looking bad. He might find it functional but not necessarily appealing on a deeper level.

Purchase intention: Since he intends to buy things that are practical and useful, if this drink is perceived as effective, he might consider purchasing it. However, his disagreement with being helpful and unselfish doesn't directly affect purchase decisions here, since the ad targets personal benefits rather than helping others.

In terms of attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. - He's reserved but talkative; maybe not overly enthusiastic about the ad.
2. Interesting? - The message is clear but not very original or imaginative, so might be neutral on interestingness.
3. Good: It addresses practical concerns (energy and appearance), which he values, so might agree it's good.
4. Attractive: Functional ads can be attractive if they meet his needs, but since he has few artistic interests, maybe neutral.

Purchase intentions:

1. Intend to purchase: Maybe 5/7 if the ad makes him think it’s useful.
2. Try to buy: Might need more information or trust before trying.
3. Consider buying: Possibly higher than try because considering is a lower bar.

So scores might be [4, 3, 5] for attitude and [4, 3, 5] for purchase intentions.
