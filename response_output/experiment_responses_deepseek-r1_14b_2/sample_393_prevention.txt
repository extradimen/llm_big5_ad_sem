Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down.

First, my background: I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman living with my parents. I work in an office, have a high school education, and earn between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm neutral about being talkative, strongly disagree with being outgoing or helpful, and generally distrustful. I sometimes agree with being rude, don't do thorough jobs, and often make plans without following through. I’m emotionally stable but can be careless.

Looking at the ad's message: It's suggesting that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. So it’s targeting someone who wants to stay alert and presentable, possibly for work or social reasons.

Considering my personality, I'm not very outgoing or helpful, so maybe this ad isn't tailored to me because I don’t prioritize social interactions much. But since I’m an office worker, staying alert is important. The ad's message might resonate a bit because feeling tired could affect my job performance.

I'm emotionally stable but sometimes worry and get nervous easily. Maybe the idea of looking dull makes me self-conscious, which could make the ad more appealing. However, being reserved and not too trusting might make me skeptical about the product's effectiveness.

The ad uses fear to create a need: feeling tired and looking dull are negatives that people would want to avoid. But I'm also original and have an active imagination, so maybe the ad is trying to tap into my desire for new solutions to stay energized.

On the other hand, being unhelpful and sometimes rude might mean I don’t see the need for this product as much as someone more social. Plus, I tend not to follow through on plans, which could relate to lacking motivation without the drink.

So, in terms of attitude toward the ad: It's interesting because it addresses real concerns but might feel manipulative since it uses fear. Whether it's good or attractive depends on how it's presented, but I'm neutral towards such tactics. Purchase intention is low because I don't prioritize this need highly and am skeptical of the claims.
