Okay, so I need to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down the information provided about myself:

- **Demographics**: I'm from China, over 60 years old, have a bachelor's degree, work as a blue-collar worker, am divorced, and earn between 26,000,000 to 35,000,000 VND monthly. That's a pretty good income in Vietnam, so maybe I can afford premium products.

- **Personality Traits**:
   - Talkative: Agree (7)
   - Outgoing and Sociable: Strongly Agree (7)
   - Reserved: Agree (6)
   - Helpful and Unselfish: Disagree (1)
   - Trusting: Agree (7)
   - Sometimes Rude: Strongly Agree (7)
   - Thorough Job: Strongly Agree (7)
   - Makes Plans/Follows Through: Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Careless: Agree (6)
   - Nervous Easily: Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Worry a Lot: Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Emotionally Stable: Agree (7)
   - Active Imagination: Strongly Agree (7)
   - Original/New Ideas: Strongly Agree (7)
   - Artistic Interests: Disagree (6)

Now, the ad's message is about a drink that helps stay energized and look good. Given my income level, I can probably afford such products, but I'm not sure if it's necessary for me.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing and talkative, which might make social energy important to me. But I'm also disagreeable in terms of being helpful; maybe that doesn't matter here. The ad is positive, suggesting the drink can improve my daily appearance and energy levels, which could appeal to someone looking to maintain or enhance their lifestyle.

Considering trust, I tend to agree with trusting others, so if the ad seems trustworthy, it might influence me positively. However, the ad is a bit vague—it doesn't provide specific evidence or details about how the drink actually works. This lack of detail makes me less likely to strongly believe in its effectiveness.

I also have an active imagination and come up with new ideas, which could make me more open to innovative products, but I'm also careful (or not) depending on other traits. Wait, no—I tend to agree with being careless, so maybe I'm not overly cautious about such things.

My tendency to be thorough suggests that if the ad provided more details, it would be better. But since it's short and lacks specifics, it might not fully engage me.

Looking at purchase intention: I'm on the fence because while the idea is appealing, without concrete evidence or a strong personal connection (like maybe friends using it), I'm not sure. Plus, given that I'm over 60, I might be more cautious about new products unless they're proven.

So for ad attitude:
1. Like: The message is positive and could resonate with someone looking to improve their appearance and energy, but since the ad is vague, maybe a 5.
2. Interesting: It's not particularly unique; many ads make similar claims, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: Not great because it lacks specifics, so perhaps a 4.
4. Attractive: The message is positive and could be visually appealing if executed well, but the text alone isn't enough—maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Since I'm not convinced by the ad alone, maybe a low score like 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe higher than intent because it's an offer, so perhaps 4.
3. Consider buying: If I feel the product could be useful, I might consider it, so maybe 5.

Wait, but I need to use the scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). So let me think again:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like: The ad is positive and makes me feel good, so maybe a 6.
2. Interesting: It's not particularly unique, so maybe 5.
3. Good: Not the best because it's too vague, perhaps 5.
4. Attractive: If the visuals are appealing, maybe 6.

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to buy: Maybe 5 because I'm somewhat interested but not convinced.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 6 if the ad makes me curious enough.
3. Consider buying: Perhaps 7 if it aligns with my needs and I think it's effective.

Wait, maybe higher for purchase intention since energy is important as a worker and looking good might matter socially. So:

Ad Attitude Scores:
1. Like: 6
2. Interesting:5
3. Good:5
4. Attractive:6

Purchase Intention:
1. Intent to buy:5
2. Try to buy:6
3. Consider buying:7

I think that's a better fit because the ad's positive message might attract me, but without specifics, it's not enough to strongly agree on all points. Purchase intention is moderately high because while I'm interested, I need more information before deciding.
