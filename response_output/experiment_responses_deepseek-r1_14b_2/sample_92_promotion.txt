Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Considering my personality traits, I'm reserved and sometimes careless. The ad is vague and doesn't speak to any specific needs I might have. So, I don't feel a strong connection or liking towards it. Score: 2.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - While the concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing, the execution is generic. It doesn't offer anything unique that would hold my attention. Score: 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is clear but lacks depth or emotional appeal. Without a compelling story or personal connection, it's hard for me to find it truly good. Score: 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Visually, ads can be吸引人, but without specific details on how the drink actually helps, it doesn't attract me much. Score: 2.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Since I'm not convinced about the benefits and tend to make careless decisions, there's no strong intent to buy. Score: 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without a clear reason or incentive, trying it isn't something I'd prioritize. Score: 4 (maybe on a whim).

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's not something I would think about much, but the idea of looking good might make me consider it once in a while. Score: 5.
