Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and assign scores based on my given profile. Let me start by understanding the ad itself. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, that's a prevention-focused message, right? It's trying to scare people into buying the product to avoid negative outcomes like feeling tired or looking dull.

Now, considering my demographics: I'm from China, male, in my 30s, have a bachelor's degree, work as a managerial employee, divorced, and earn around 36-45 million VND monthly. So, I'm probably someone with a decent income but maybe a busy lifestyle given my job.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm neutral about being talkative, disagree on being outgoing and helpful, which might mean I'm more introverted or less likely to be in social situations where appearances matter. I strongly disagree with being reserved, so perhaps I'm somewhere in the middle. My agree with doing a thorough job suggests attention to detail, but I don't make plans often and tend not to be careless. I get nervous easily and sometimes worry a lot, which might affect how I perceive stress or fatigue.

The ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and dullness. Since I'm a manager, maybe I have busy days where staying alert is important. However, my personality traits suggest I might not be the most outgoing, so looking dull in social settings might not be as crucial for me as it would be for someone else. But feeling tired could still be a concern.

The ad's message is about prevention—avoiding negative outcomes. People with higher income might prefer products that maintain their image or energy levels. However, I'm not sure if the ad resonates with me because while I do worry about feeling tired, my personality traits like being less helpful and trusting might make me skeptical of such claims.

I also have an active imagination but am neutral on being original. So maybe the ad's message is clear but doesn't particularly inspire me creatively. My tendency to get nervous could mean that ads invoking fear might not be well-received, as I'm already prone to anxiety.

Now, evaluating the ad态度:

1. Do I like it? Probably not strongly because the fear-based approach might not appeal to someone who's already a bit anxious.
2. Interesting? Maybe somewhat interesting but not compelling.
3. Good? It's functional but doesn't feel emotionally resonant for me.
4. Attractive? Not really, since I'm more reserved and less outgoing.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Unlikely because the ad doesn't speak directly to my values or lifestyle strongly enough.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if there's a promotion, but not sure.
3. Consider buying? Possibly, but probably low on my list of priorities.

So, I'm thinking scores around 2-4 for ad attitude and lower for purchase intention.
