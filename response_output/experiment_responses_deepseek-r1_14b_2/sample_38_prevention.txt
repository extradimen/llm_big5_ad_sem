Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this virtual person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down their profile and personality traits step by step.

First, her demographic details: she's from China, over 60 years old, has a bachelor's degree, is single, a student, earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a decent income for Vietnam, maybe she's part of an affluent family or comes from a wealthy background.

Her personality traits: Neutral on being talkative and outgoing, so she might not be the most social but isn't reserved either. Strongly Disagree with being reserved, which means she's probably more open. Disagrees with being helpful and unselfish—maybe she's more self-centered or less inclined to help others. Strongly Agrees on trusting people, so she's likely trustworthy and believes in others.

She sometimes disagrees with being rude, meaning she might not be the friendliest but isn't outright hostile. She Disagrees on doing thorough jobs, which could mean she's a bit careless or maybe just not detail-oriented. Neutral about making plans—maybe inconsistent? Strongly Disagrees with being careless, so she's meticulous. Gets nervous easily and worries a lot sometimes, but is emotionally stable otherwise. She has few artistic interests but can be original and come up with new ideas.

Now, the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's focusing on preventing tiredness and dull looks, so it's a prevention-oriented ad.

Thinking about her personality, she's trusting (strongly agrees) which might make her more open to believing in the product. She's emotionally stable but can get nervous easily—maybe she's looking for ways to manage stress or maintain energy. She's original and comes up with ideas, so perhaps she values products that help her stay active and energetic.

However, she sometimes disagrees with being helpful and unselfish. Maybe she's more focused on herself rather than others. Since she's a student over 60, maybe she's looking for something to keep her alert during studies or daily activities.

Looking at the ad's message, it targets feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable. The prevention aspect might appeal to someone who values health and vitality. Her trustworthiness could make her more receptive to such claims.

But wait, she strongly agrees with having few artistic interests and this drink is probably marketed in a way that's more about functionality than creativity. Maybe the ad doesn't align with her tastes if it's too flashy or artistic, but since she's original, she might appreciate a simple, effective message.

For purchase intention: She's emotionally stable but gets nervous easily—maybe she wants something to help her manage stress and maintain energy. Her income is high, so she can afford premium products. However, does the ad make her feel that this drink is essential for her needs?

On the other hand, she's somewhat neutral about being talkative and outgoing, so maybe the social aspect of looking dull isn't as pressing to her. She might not be as concerned with others' perceptions unless it directly affects her self-esteem.

Putting it together: The ad's message resonates on health and energy, which could align with her values. Her trust in people makes her more likely to believe the claims. However, she's not extremely outgoing, so the social aspect may not be a top motivator, but preventing tiredness is practical.

So for attitude toward the ad: She might find it interesting (since it offers a solution), good because it seems helpful, and attractive if the messaging is clear. Maybe she likes it because it addresses her needs to stay energetic and focused as a student.

Purchase intention: She might intend to purchase because it's positioned as something beneficial for her health and daily routine. Trying or considering it could be likely given her income level and the product's positioning.
