Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at their demographic profile. They're a Chinese woman in her 40s, have a postgraduate degree, and are a managerial employee. She makes less than 15 million VND a month and is divorced. Her personality traits show she's reserved, not very helpful or unselfish, doesn't trust others much, sometimes rude, careless, and has few artistic interests but is emotionally stable.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the main message here is about energy levels and appearance. The drink is positioned to prevent tiredness and looking dull.

Now, considering her personality, she's reserved and not very outgoing. She doesn't trust others much, which might make her skeptical of ads. Also, she sometimes feels rude and careless, so maybe she doesn't care much about social appearances as others might. However, being in a managerial role, she probably wants to look professional, so looking dull could be a concern.

She's emotionally stable, so the ad's emotional appeal might not resonate with her much. Her personality traits don't lean towards trusting ads easily, which could make her less likely to believe the claims. The drink is presented as something you can't live without; she might see through that kind of exaggeration.

Looking at the questions about attitude towards the ad and purchase intention:

1. I like the ad: Since she's reserved and not very trusting, she might not find it appealing. Score around 3.
2. Interesting: The message is direct but might not capture her interest given her personality. Maybe a 4.
3. Good: She's critical, so unless the ad is well-made, she might not think it's good. Probably a 3.
4. Attractive: Ads that are more emotional or social might not attract her. Maybe a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She's cautious and might not feel the need after seeing the ad. Score 3.
2. Try to buy: Similar reasoning, maybe a 4 if it's positioned as useful.
3. Consider buying: Might think about it but not immediately. Maybe a 5.

I'm thinking she's on the fence because while the drink addresses concerns about energy and appearance, her personality makes her skeptical and reserved, so she might not be swayed easily. But since looking good is important in a managerial role, there's some consideration.
