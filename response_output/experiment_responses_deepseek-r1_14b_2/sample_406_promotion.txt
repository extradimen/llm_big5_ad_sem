Alright, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese civil servant in my late thirties. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down how I'd respond.

First, considering my personality: I'm talkative but not outgoing, which might mean I prefer ads that are more informative rather than overly social. I'm helpful? Not really—so messages about helping others might not resonate. But I do trust people a lot and make thorough plans, so credibility is important to me. However, I get nervous easily and worry a lot, but also have an active imagination. 

Looking at the ad's message: It's about energy and looking good daily. For someone in my position, staying energized could be appealing because of long work hours. Plus, looking good is a social aspect that might matter for professional interactions.

For attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. – Maybe 3. It’s positive but not sure if it's tailored to me.
2. Interesting. – 4. The idea of energy and appearance is relatable.
3. Good. – 4. Clear message, but might need more specifics.
4. Attractive. – 5. Visuals could be appealing, but the ad needs context.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy. – 3. Not enough info, but it's a consideration.
2. Try to buy. – 3. Might wait for reviews or more details.
3. Consider buying. – 4. It’s on my radar, but not a must-have yet.

I think the ad is decent but lacks specifics about how it actually works and what makes it different. Without that, I'm cautious.
