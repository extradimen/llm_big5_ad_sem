Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: It focuses on preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Given that I'm a manager with high income, I value looking professional and energetic. The ad directly addresses concerns about appearing tired, which is relevant to my daily life.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad. (6/7)**: The message is clear and targets issues I care about, so I find it likable.
2. **I think the ad is interesting. (5/7)**: It's straightforward but could be more engaging with a stronger emotional appeal or visuals.
3. **I believe the ad is good. (6/7)**: The message aligns with my needs, making me trust its effectiveness.
4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**: It's functional but lacks creative elements that might make it more appealing.

Purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product. (5/7)**: While the ad resonates, I'm cautious about the actual product's benefits without more information.
2. **I will try to buy this product. (6/7)**: The message makes me consider giving it a try to see if it works.
3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**: It's on my radar, but I might wait for reviews or promotions before deciding.

Overall, the ad effectively addresses specific concerns but could improve by adding more emotional depth or evidence of the drink's effectiveness.
