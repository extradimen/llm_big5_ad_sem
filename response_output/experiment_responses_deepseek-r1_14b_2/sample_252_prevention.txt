Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let me start by understanding their profile and personality traits.

They're a Chinese male under 20 with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Their personality traits show they're reserved (strongly agree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), make plans and follow through (strongly agree), get nervous easily (strongly agree), have an active imagination (strongly agree), but are not talkative or outgoing, don't do thorough jobs, aren't original with ideas, etc.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting someone who might feel fatigued and wants to avoid looking sleepy. Considering their age and occupation, maybe they're a student or young professional needing energy.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **Ad Attitude**:
   - Like: The ad seems aimed at avoiding tiredness and looking dull. Since he's reserved but has an active imagination, maybe it doesn't resonate much because he might not feel the need to change his appearance or tiredness is a given.
   - Interesting: Maybe 3 because it's somewhat relatable but not engaging enough for him.
   - Good: Itâ€™s straightforward but lacks depth in appeal, so perhaps a 4.
   - Attractive: The message is simple, but without strong imagery, maybe a 5.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - Intend to buy: He's reserved and might not feel compelled enough. A low score like 3.
   - Try to buy: If he feels the drink addresses his tiredness, maybe he'd consider it, so 4.
   - Consider buying: It's on his radar but not a must-have, so a 5.

I think his reserved nature and high tendency to get nervous might make him cautious about trying new products. His active imagination could make him think there are better options elsewhere.
