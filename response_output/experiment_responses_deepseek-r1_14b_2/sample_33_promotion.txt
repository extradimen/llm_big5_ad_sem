Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which aligns with someone who values their appearance and energy levels. However, being reserved (Agree) makes me less likely to openly express interest in such ads. Also, the strong disagree on helpfulness might make me more skeptical of the claims. So, I scored it a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The benefits are clear, but since I tend to be careless (Strongly Disagree) and not thoroughly convinced by ads, it's only moderately interesting. A 4 seems right.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: The message is positive, but my general trust is high, so I'm more likely to find it believable. However, the lack of detailed information makes me score it a 5.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: While the idea is appealing, my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious make me less drawn to it visually or emotionally. A 3 fits here.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: The benefits are tempting, but I'm skeptical of ads (Strongly Disagree on helpfulness) and don't plan to buy without more info. So, a 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Maybe in the future if others recommend it, but not immediately. A 3 seems accurate.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's on my radar, but I'm not committed yet. A 4 makes sense.

Overall, I'm moderately interested but not convinced enough to act right away.
