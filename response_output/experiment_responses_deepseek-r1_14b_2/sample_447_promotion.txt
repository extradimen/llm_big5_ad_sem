Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, for the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad emphasizes staying energized and looking your best, which are appealing to many people, especially those in managerial roles who need energy. However, it's a bit generic. So, I'd give it a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** While the message is positive, it doesn't stand out or offer anything unique. It's just another energy drink ad. So, a 4 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The ad does convey positive benefits but lacks specific details about how it achieves those results. Without more information, my belief isn't strong. A 5 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals and message are appealing enough for a quick glance, but they don't capture my attention for long. A 6 is reasonable because it's somewhat attractive but not outstanding.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm not convinced by the claims without more evidence or specific benefits. So, a 3 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's some appeal, but I might wait for more information or see other options. A 4 is appropriate.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on my radar, but not a sure thing yet. A 5 reflects that consideration without strong commitment.

Overall, the ad is decent but lacks specifics to strongly influence me towards purchase.
