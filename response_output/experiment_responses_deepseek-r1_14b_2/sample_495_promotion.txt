Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let's start by understanding his background and personality traits.

He's from China, over 60 years old, married, with a bachelor’s degree and a blue-collar job earning between 16–25 million VND monthly. That's actually quite a high income for Vietnam, so he might have higher purchasing power. His education is a bachelor’s, which isn't super high but enough to understand basic ads.

Looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, Sociable: Strongly Disagree (so probably introverted)
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree (so he's suspicious)
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree (polite)
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree (maybe careless or not detailed-oriented)
- Makes plans and follows through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Disagree (but he might be organized)
- Gets nervous easily: Agree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree (contradicts the above; maybe inconsistent)
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Few artistic interests: Neutral

So overall, he's somewhat introverted, not very trusting, gets nervous easily but isn't that worried. He has an active imagination and is original.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering his age (over 60), staying energized might be appealing because energy levels can drop as one ages. Looking good could also be important for self-esteem, especially if he's active or still working.

But given that he's strongly disagreeing with being trusting and outgoing, he might be skeptical of such ads. The claims are quite broad ("stay energized," "look your best"), which might not hold much credibility for him since he tends to be suspicious. He might think it's too good to be true or a marketing ploy.

He gets nervous easily, so maybe the ad's message could make him anxious if he doubts its effectiveness or fears negative side effects.

His active imagination and originality might make him more open to creative ideas, but if the ad is too vague or lacks concrete evidence, he might not trust it.

Purchase intention: He has a high income, which means he can afford such products. However, his skepticism might make him wait for reviews or try a different brand first. Since he doesn't find ads interesting or good, he's less likely to intend buying immediately but might consider it if others recommend it.

So scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: Maybe 3 (Neutral)
2. Interesting: 4 (Mildly Agree)
3. Good: 3 (Neutral)
4. Attractive: 4 (Mildly Agree)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 3 (Neutral)
2. Try to buy: 4
3. Consider buying: 5 (Agree, but not sure yet)
