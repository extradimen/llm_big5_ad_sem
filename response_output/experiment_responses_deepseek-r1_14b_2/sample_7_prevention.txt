Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So first, their background: they're a Chinese male in his 50s, postgraduate education, an office worker living with parents, and earns between 26-35 million VND a month. That's a decent income, so maybe he has some disposable income.

Looking at his personality traits: Neutral about being talkative and reserved, Disagree on being outgoing, which suggests he might not be the most social person. Strongly Disagree on being helpful and unselfish, so perhaps he's more self-centered. Also, Disagree on trusting others, but agrees he can sometimes be rude. He's Neutral on thoroughness, planning, and carelessness, but strongly disagrees with getting nervous easily.

Now, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. Maybe it's an energy drink or something similar.

Given his personality, he might not find the ad very appealing because he's not outgoing or sociable. The message about looking dull might not resonate with him as much since he's more reserved. Also, being somewhat rude and less trusting could make him skeptical of such ads. His income is high, but his traits suggest he's not someone who would be swayed easily by such claims.

For the attitude toward the ad: He's Neutral on being talkative and reserved, which might mean he doesn't find the ad particularly interesting or good. The wording about feeling tired could relate to him if he has a busy job, but his tendency towards thoroughness is neutral, so it's not a strong motivator.

Purchase intention: He earns enough to afford such products, but his skepticism and being less trusting might make him less likely to try the product just based on an ad. Plus, he doesn't feel strongly about social image, so the "look dull" part might not affect him much.

So overall, he probably wouldn't be very moved by this ad, giving it low scores on likability and interest. For purchase intention, maybe neutral or slightly disagreeable since he's not convinced by the ad but could consider other factors.
