Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems like a prevention message because it's highlighting what negative things could happen without the product, which is a common strategy in ads to make people aware of potential problems.

Now, considering her background: she's from China, female, under 20, with a bachelor’s degree. She's living with her parents and earns between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly, which is a decent income. Her personality traits are interesting. She's talkative but not outgoing or reserved—so maybe she prefers interactions that aren't too overwhelming. She's helpful and unselfish, so she might appreciate ads that show community or social benefits.

She strongly disagrees with being trusting, which means she might be skeptical of the ad’s claims. She sometimes feels rude, which could make her critical of the message if it's pushy. She doesn’t do thorough jobs and isn't too careful, but she makes plans neutrally. Her emotional stability is strong, so maybe she won't get stressed by the ad, but she has a neutral attitude towards being careless.

She gets nervous easily? Neutral, so not too affected by stress. Doesn't worry much, which might make her less concerned about feeling tired or dull. But she's emotionally stable—so maybe she can handle any negative messages in ads without it affecting her mood too much.

Her imagination is weak, and she doesn’t come up with new ideas. She has strong artistic interests, so perhaps she's more visually oriented but not necessarily creative herself. 

Now, evaluating the ad: It’s a prevention message, which might play on fears of tiredness and looking bad. But does it resonate with her? Let's see. She's talkative and helpful, maybe valuing social interactions but not outgoing. The ad is pushing the idea that without this drink, she'll look dull and feel tired. Since she's emotionally stable and doesn't worry a lot, maybe this message isn't too compelling for her.

She might find the ad interesting because it relates to energy and appearance, which are common concerns, but being skeptical (disagreeing with trust), she might not fully believe the claims. So, her like score might be low. Interesting could be neutral or low. Being good—if it's truthful, maybe 3? Attractive—depends on how visually appealing it is.

For purchase intention: She has a high income but is under 20, so maybe more into lifestyle products. But the ad doesn't strongly align with her personality traits, like being thorough (she disagrees), so she might not feel compelled to act. Intent to purchase might be low. Trying or considering it could also be neutral because while she's in a good income bracket, the message doesn't hit home enough.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: 3, 4, 5, 6
Purchase intentions: 3, 4, 5

Wait, but let me think again. The ad is about looking dull and feeling tired without the drink. She's talkative and helpful, so maybe she does care about her appearance and energy levels to maintain social interactions. Even though she's not outgoing, being helpful might make her value products that help her stay active and present in social settings.

She gets nervous easily but it's neutral, so maybe she doesn't feel pressured by the ad. But since she doesn’t do thorough jobs, she might not research much before buying, which could lead to a neutral intent. 

Her artistic interests are strong, so if the ad is visually appealing, that could make it more attractive. Maybe her attraction score is higher.

I think I need to adjust:

Ad attitude: 4 (like), 5 (interesting), 6 (good), 7 (attractive). Wait, but she's not very trusting and might question the claims. So maybe lower.

Alternatively, if the ad is visually strong and addresses her concerns about energy and appearance, she might find it more appealing.

Purchase intention: Maybe 3, 4, 5. She has the income, but she doesn't feel strongly persuaded by the message.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, prevention ads can be effective if they tap into real fears, but her skepticism and personality traits might make her less responsive.
