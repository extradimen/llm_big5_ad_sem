Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the given scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad. (4)**: The advertisement is straightforward and targets common desiresâ€”energy and looking good. However, while it's appealing, I don't feel a strong emotional connection or personal relevance to make me "like" it strongly.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting. (5)**: It's somewhat engaging because staying energized and looking good are relatable concerns, but without specific details or a compelling hook, it doesn't stand out as particularly interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: The message is clear and positive, which I appreciate. However, it lacks depth and specific benefits that would make me fully trust its claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5)**: Visually and conceptually, the ad has potential to attract attention, especially given the target audience's focus on energy and appearance.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3)**: While the benefits are appealing, there's a lack of evidence or personal experience with the product. This makes me hesitant to form a strong intention to buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4)**: The ad makes me curious enough to consider giving it a try, especially if convenience allows, but I wouldn't actively seek it out without more information.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5)**: The benefits align with my personal goals, so I would definitely keep the product in mind when considering purchases related to energy and appearance.
