Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 40-49 year old Chinese office worker with the given demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad: It claims the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. These are two strong selling points—energy and appearance.

Looking at my personality, I'm talkative (strongly agree) but reserved (agree). So, I might appreciate an ad that's engaging but not too overwhelming. Being outgoing is neutral, so perhaps the ad needs to be more personal or relatable.

I'm helpful and unselfish, which means ads that focus on benefits for others might resonate, but this one seems self-focused. Trust is neutral; maybe the ad doesn't build enough trust. Worrying a lot (strongly agree) and being thorough (agree) makes me cautious—does the ad provide enough evidence?

I tend to make plans and follow through (strongly agree), so an ad that offers something reliable might appeal. But I'm also emotionally stable, which could mean I don't react strongly to emotional appeals.

Now, considering my job as an office worker in China with a decent income, staying energized is crucial. The ad's promise of energy and looking good aligns well with my needs.

How would the ad make me feel? Since I'm talkative but reserved, maybe the message is too direct or pushy. But it's also highlighting benefits that are important to me.

Purchase intention: If the ad makes me believe in the product's effectiveness, I might consider buying it. However, without specific evidence or a compelling reason beyond just looking good and being energized, my cautious nature might hold me back from immediately intending to buy.

So, for ad attitude, maybe 4/7 on like, interesting as 3, good as 4, attractive as 5. For purchase intention, I'm not sure yet—maybe a 3, 3, and 4.
