Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND and I'm divorced.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, my personality traits. I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing? Disagree, so more reserved but not as much as disagreeing. Reserved is a Disagree for me. So maybe not very outgoing but not overly reserved either.

I'm helpful and unselfish, which I strongly agree with. But I'm generally trusting? Strongly Disagree, so I might be cautious about the ad's claims. 

I worry a lot (Strongly Agree), so ads that target anxiety or stress could resonate, especially if they offer solutions. The drink is supposed to help stay energized and look good, which are daily concerns.

Emotionally stable? Strongly Disagree, so I might be more susceptible to emotional appeals but also more critical of the ad's credibility.

I tend to make plans and follow through (Agree), so if the product is presented as reliable and consistent, it could appeal. However, I sometimes worry a lot, which makes me more skeptical about exaggerated claims.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. Do I like it? The message is positive but generic. It's appealing on a surface level, but since I'm cautious, maybe not strongly like it. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting? It's not particularly unique or compelling. So probably a 3 here too.
3. Good? It's decent but doesn't stand out as excellent. A 4 perhaps.
4. Attractive? The visuals and message are okay, so a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Not sure yet, but the claims seem a bit too good. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy? Slightly more inclination, maybe 4.
3. Consider buying? Definitely on my mind, so a 5.

I need to ensure that each score is between 1 and 7, reflecting my cautious yet somewhat interested stance.
