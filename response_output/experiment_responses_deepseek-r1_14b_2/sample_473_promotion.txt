Alright, so I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: the individual is from China, male, under 20, has a postgraduate degree, works as a managerial employee, is married, with a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. That's quite a high income for someone so young in China.

Now, looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Generally trusting: Neutral
- Sometimes rude: Agree
- Thorough job: Agree
- Makes plans and follows through: Neutral
- Careless: Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original with new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Agree

The advertisement is for a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is talkative but not outgoing, which might make them value social interactions without seeking them out. They get nervous easily, so ads that promise confidence or looking good might resonate to reduce anxiety. However, they are also somewhat reserved and might find such an ad too pushy. But since they have a high income, they might appreciate the idea of looking their best as a status symbol.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad's message is about energy and appearance. Given that they're thorough in their work, maybe the idea of staying energized for productivity appeals to them. Also, having an active imagination could make the ad more intriguing if it's creative. However, being reserved might make the ad less appealing if it's too over-the-top.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - For belief, credibility matters. Since they sometimes get rude and are neutral on trust, but earn a high income, maybe they're cautious about such claims. They worry not much, so perhaps they don't see immediate value in the product beyond superficial benefits. But being thorough might make them question if the ad is backed by real evidence.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness ties into how visually and emotionally appealing the ad is. If it's well-made and highlights the benefits of looking good, which could appeal to someone who values their appearance. However, if it's too focused on social aspects, being reserved might make them less attracted.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - High income suggests they can afford luxury items. The ad's promise of energy and appearance could align with a desire for productivity and social confidence. But if the person is more introverted, maybe not as much. Plus, being careless might make them less likely to follow through.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying something new isn't a strong trait here. They're neutral on making plans but thorough in their work. Maybe they'd be cautious about trying the product unless convinced by the ad's message.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is more likely if the ad resonates with their desire for improvement in energy and appearance, especially since they have an active imagination which might make them open to the idea of a drink making such a difference.

Putting it all together:

For ad attitude scores: The person might find the ad somewhat interesting but not overly likable. They might believe it's good if it's well-crafted but not necessarily attractive if it's too pushy. So scores could be 3, 4, 4, and 3 respectively.

For purchase intention: Considering buying is likely, trying less so, and intending to buy even less. Scores might be 3, 2, 4.
