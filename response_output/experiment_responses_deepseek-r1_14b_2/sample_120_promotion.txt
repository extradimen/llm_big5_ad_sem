Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that's supposed to keep me energized and look my best every day. Let me break down how I feel about it based on the information provided.

First, looking at the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It sounds pretty straightforward with two main benefits—energy and appearance. Since I'm a student in China, maybe around 20-29 years old, these points might hit close to home because students often need energy boosts and might care about looking good.

But wait, I scored myself as disagree on being helpful and unselfish, which suggests I might not be too focused on others' needs. However, the ad is talking about personal benefits, so that's probably relevant. Also, I'm neutral on being talkative and outgoing, but the ad doesn't seem to rely much on social interactions, just individual benefits.

I scored strongly disagree on trusting people, which makes me a bit skeptical. The ad claims it helps you look your best every day—does that mean it's a miracle drink? That seems too good to be true. I'm also strongly agreeing on having few artistic interests and being original, but the ad isn't about creativity or anything artsy, so maybe that doesn't influence me much.

Looking at my personality traits, I tend to disagree with being helpful and trusting. So when ads make big claims without evidence, it makes me more skeptical. The benefits here are clear, but they're presented in a way that might come off as overhyped. Also, I'm neutral on whether I worry a lot, but since I find the ad's claims a bit too perfect, I might question if there are any hidden downsides.

On the positive side, being original and imaginative could make me open to new products, especially if they promise something unique. The idea of staying energized is appealing because as a student, long study hours can be draining. Plus, looking good is something many people care about, so that's a solid selling point.

But considering my income level, 26–35 million VND a month. That's around $1000 to $1400 USD roughly, which in Vietnam might not be the highest but still allows for some spending on personal care products. However, if this drink is priced higher, it might make me think twice.

I'm also strongly disagreeing with being sometimes rude, so maybe I don't see a need to rush into buying something just because an ad says so. But the benefits are tempting—energy and looking good. Maybe I would consider trying it once, but not necessarily buy it immediately unless there's a discount or review backing it up.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: It's okay, but I'm not blown away by it. The claims are clear, but they feel a bit too perfect without any evidence. So, I might not like it much, find it somewhat interesting, think it's just average, and not particularly attractive because of the overhyped nature.

For purchase intention: I don't have a strong intent to buy right away, maybe try it if someone recommends it or there's a promotion, but considering buying it is still on my list. So my intentions are low but possible with more info.
