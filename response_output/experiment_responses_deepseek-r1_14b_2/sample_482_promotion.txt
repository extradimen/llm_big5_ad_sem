Alright, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement based on my given profile. First, I need to understand the ad itself: it's promoting a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. So, the main benefits are energy and appearance.

Now, considering my background as someone from China, over 60 years old, with a bachelor’s degree, working as an office worker, divorced, and earning more than 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm reserved, helpful, strongly disagree with being trusting, sometimes rude, strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, but make plans and follow through, tend to be careless (disagree), not get nervous easily, don't worry a lot, emotionally stable (disagree), have an active imagination (neutral), original and creative (disagree), and neutral about artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's attitude scores:

1. I like the ad: The ad is about staying energized and looking good. Since I'm over 60, maybe I'm more concerned with health and vitality. The drink could be seen as a way to maintain energy levels, which might appeal to me. However, I'm reserved, so I'm not sure if I would like an ad that's too pushy or energetic. Maybe it's okay but not something I'd strongly like.

2. I think the ad is interesting: The benefits are clear—energy and looking good. But for someone older, maybe the emphasis on appearance isn't as strong as health aspects. I'm neutral about this because while the message is straightforward, it might not deeply resonate with me since I'm more reserved and perhaps not easily interested in such ads.

3. I believe the ad is good: The claims are positive, but I'm someone who strongly disagrees with trusting others easily. So, I might be skeptical about the product's effectiveness. Also, being careful (disagree), so I don't trust the ad fully. Therefore, my belief in the ad's goodness would be lower.

4. I find the ad attractive: The ad is trying to look appealing, but as a reserved person, maybe it's not something that catches my eye strongly. It might be average in terms of attracting me.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product: Since I'm over 60 and perhaps more health-conscious, the idea of staying energized is good. But I'm cautious about products because I don't trust easily (strongly disagree). Plus, my income is high, but I might not feel the need for such a drink if I can manage without it.

2. I will try to buy this product: There's some interest in trying new things, but given my skepticism and being reserved, I might not actively seek out to buy it unless there's more convincing evidence or a strong recommendation.

3. I will consider buying this product: Considering the benefits, I might think about it, especially if I'm looking for something to boost energy. However, without trust in the ad, I'm less likely to take action but still might give it some thought.
