Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down step by step.

First, my background: I'm a Chinese student under 20, single, from a high school education, with a monthly income between 26,000,000â€“35,000,000 VND. My personality traits include being outgoing but also reserved, trusting, sometimes rude, not very thorough, make plans but can be careless, emotionally stable, original, and have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad, it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull without the drink. I think this is a prevention-focused message because it's highlighting what you might miss out on or feel if you don't use the product. It's using negative emotions to encourage action.

Now, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, the message is clear but maybe a bit negative. I'm not sure if that would make me like it. Maybe 4 out of 7.
2. Is it interesting? It does make you think about energy and appearance, so maybe 5.
3. Is the ad good? It's simple but might not be very creative. So, probably a 4.
4. Is it attractive? The message is direct, but I'm not sure if that's appealing enough. Maybe another 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad makes me aware of the problem, so maybe I'm considering it. A 5.
2. Will try to buy: Not sure yet, might need more info. So, 3.
3. Will consider buying: Definitely, but not decided yet. Maybe a 4.

Wait, let me think again. The ad uses fear of tiredness and looking bad, which could resonate with someone who values social image and energy. Since I'm outgoing, maybe that's appealing. But the negative tone might not be as effective. Also, I'm not very thorough, so I might not be convinced just by this ad alone. So perhaps my initial scores need adjustment.

Adjusting:

Ad attitude: Maybe 4,5,4,4
Purchase intention: 3,4,5?

Wait no, purchase intention should reflect how likely I am to buy based on the ad. If I'm considering but not sure, maybe higher for consideration. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.
