Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my responses for both the ad attitude and purchase intention scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The advertisement claims that the drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day. Given my personality traits, I am highly agreeable and helpful, which might make me more susceptible to messages that promote positivity. However, the ad is quite generic without any specific evidence or details about how it actually achieves these benefits. As someone who tends to get nervous easily and worries a lot, I'm cautious about such claims. So, while the message is appealing, the lack of concrete information makes me not entirely like it, so I'd give it a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The promise of energy and looking good is attractive, especially to someone who values their appearance and social interactions as much as I do. But again, without specific benefits or unique selling points, the ad doesn't stand out as particularly interesting. It's a common message in the market, so my interest is moderate at 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - For an ad to be believable, it needs to provide credibility or evidence. The current phrasing lacks any scientific backing, customer testimonials, or clear product benefits. Given that I'm strongly disagreeing with trusting ads, this makes me skeptical. So, my belief in the ad's goodness is low, around a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - While the message is positive and aligns with desirable outcomes, the execution might not be visually or conceptually appealing enough for me to find it attractive. Without strong imagery or a unique angle, it doesn't capture my attention strongly, hence a 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My score here is a 3. The ad's claims are tempting, but the lack of specific information makes me hesitant. I'm more practical and cautious in my purchasing decisions, especially with higher-priced items. Without knowing how the drink actually works or its ingredients, I'm not convinced enough to intend a purchase.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - While I might be curious, trying it isn't a sure thing. The ad doesn't provide enough incentive for me to take that step, especially considering my tight budget as a civil servant in China. So, I'm on the fence here, giving it a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Since the ad does touch upon benefits that resonate with me (staying energized and looking good), I can't outright dismiss it. It's something I might think about if I see more information or offers elsewhere. Thus, a 5 seems appropriate as I'm somewhat open to considering it.

Overall, my scores reflect a cautious but not entirely disinterested stance towards the ad and the product.
