Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down their profile and personality traits first.

They're from China, over 60 years old, a blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree. Their monthly income is pretty high for someone in that category—26 million to 35 million VND. They’re married, which might mean they have a family to consider when buying products. 

Looking at their personality traits: they're talkative but reserved. That seems a bit conflicting. They agree with being helpful and unselfish, so maybe they value community or family-oriented products? But they also sometimes find themselves rude, which could be a barrier in trusting the ad's message.

They strongly disagree with being outgoing and sociable but strongly agree to being reserved. This might mean they prefer more private or personal ads rather than those targeting social circles. Their thoroughness is low, so maybe they don't pay too much attention to details in ads. They're not good at making plans, which could affect their decision-making process.

They get nervous easily and are strongly emotionally stable—wait, that's conflicting too. Maybe they’re sensitive but manage their emotions well. They have an average imagination and originality, so perhaps the ad needs to be clear rather than too creative. 

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting fatigue and appearance concerns. For someone over 60, maybe they're concerned about staying energetic and looking good for family or social events.

But considering their personality, the ad is pretty direct and focuses on prevention of negative outcomes—feeling tired and looking dull. They might resonate with the idea of preventing these issues, especially since they value trust in ads. 

Their high income suggests they can afford such products, but being a blue-collar worker, maybe they prioritize practicality over luxury. The ad doesn't specify benefits beyond fatigue and appearance, which might not be enough to convince them.

They're talkative but reserved, so perhaps they don't seek out social validations from ads but more personal benefits. They worry a lot, so an ad that addresses potential problems without being too pushy could work.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: Since they find ads interesting and good if they relate to their needs, but maybe not necessarily attractive because it's too direct. 

Purchase intention: They might consider buying it because it targets real concerns, but since they’re not very thorough or planful, there’s a chance they wouldn’t follow through.
