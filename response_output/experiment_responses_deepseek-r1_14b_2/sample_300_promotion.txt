Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores for the advertisement and purchase intentions. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Given my personality traits, I'm outgoing but also sometimes rude and talkative. The ad is positive and energetic, which might appeal to someone outgoing, but since I find myself being somewhat reserved and not very helpful, it doesn't resonate as strongly with me. So a 3 seems fair.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad highlights staying energized and looking good, which are relatable but feel a bit generic. My active imagination might make me notice creative elements, but I'm not convinced it's groundbreaking. A 4 feels accurate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   While the message is clear, I'm skeptical about the actual benefits of such products. My tendency to be distrustful makes me question the claims. A 3 reflects this skepticism.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   The visual appeal might catch my eye, but without a strong emotional connection or unique angle, it doesn't hold my attention long. So a moderate score of 4 is appropriate.

Moving on to purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   I don't feel the ad provides enough specific benefits or addresses any personal needs effectively. My cautious nature and tendency to worry about spending money make me unlikely to buy. A 2 fits here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Without a compelling reason or evidence of effectiveness, trying it isn't a priority. My agreeable but not strongly disagreeing trait towards helpfulness doesn't push me towards trying the product. A 3 is reasonable.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   While I'm somewhat open to new products, considering buying would depend on more information or a compelling reason. Since the ad doesn't offer much depth, a 4 seems appropriate as it's neutral but leans towards not taking action.

Overall, my skepticism and personality traits make me less likely to be swayed by this advertisement.
