Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me summarize the given information. The virtual person is from China, male, over 60 years old, has a bachelor’s degree, works as a blue-collar worker, married, and earns between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND monthly. Personality traits include being neutral on talkativeness, strongly disagreeing with being outgoing or helpful, strongly disagrees on trustworthiness, tends not to be rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, neutral on making plans, isn't careless, gets nervous easily (agrees), doesn't worry much, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, is original but neutral on new ideas, and has few artistic interests.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Now, I need to evaluate the ad based on attitude towards it and purchase intentions. The person will score each statement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

Let me start by analyzing the ad's message. It seems to target someone who might feel tired or appear unattractive without this drink. Given that the individual is over 60, perhaps the ad is appealing to energy levels and appearance.

Looking at personality traits:

- He gets nervous easily (agrees), so maybe he's concerned about looking dull in social situations.
- He has an active imagination, which might make him consider scenarios where the drink helps him stay alert or appear better.
- However, he's not outgoing or helpful, so maybe he's more focused on personal benefits rather than social interactions.

For ad attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - Does this message appeal to him? He might appreciate anything that prevents tiredness, which could be seen as a positive benefit. But if he's reserved and doesn't see the need for such products, maybe neutral. Perhaps a 4.
   
2. Interesting.
   - The idea of avoiding tiredness is somewhat relatable but not overly interesting given his personality traits. Maybe a 3.

3. Good.
   - If it addresses a real concern (feeling tired), he might find it truthful, so perhaps a 5.

4. Attractive.
   - The message is straightforward, but without strong outgoing tendencies, maybe it's just okay—perhaps a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - He gets nervous and maybe this drink could help in those situations. But he has a blue-collar job, which might influence spending habits. Not sure if he would intend to buy; maybe 3.
   
2. Try to buy.
   - If the ad is somewhat convincing but not strongly so, he might be cautious. Maybe 3.
   
3. Consider buying.
   - Given that he's open to considering things that prevent tiredness and improve appearance, perhaps a higher score here, like 4.

But wait, I should cross-check with his traits. He tends to disagree on being thorough and making plans. So maybe he's not the type to try new products unless convinced. His monthly income is substantial for Vietnam (about $700+ USD), so perhaps he can afford it but may be cautious about spending.

His nervousness might make him more interested in staying alert, so maybe higher scores on purchase intentions. Alternatively, since he doesn't trust others much and isn't helpful, the ad's message might not resonate deeply with him.

I think I'll settle on:

Ad attitude: 4, 3, 5, 4
Purchase intention: 3, 3, 4

But I'm a bit unsure about some scores. Maybe for 'intend to purchase', it should be lower since he might not feel the need strongly enough.
