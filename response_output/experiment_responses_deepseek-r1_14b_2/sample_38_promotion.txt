Alright, let me break down my thought process as I evaluate this advertisement. First, the ad is for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. The target audience in this case is someone with a specific demographic and personality profile.

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - Given my personality traits, I'm somewhat talkative and outgoing, but not extremely so. However, the idea of staying energized could appeal to me if it's presented in a way that resonates with daily life. But looking at my artistic interests, which are low, I might not find the visuals or messaging very engaging. So, maybe around 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Since I don't have strong artistic interests and tend to be reserved, the content might not capture my attention unless it's very compelling. Maybe a 3 here as well.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Belief in the ad would depend on how credible the claims are. The benefits mentioned (energy and looking good) seem plausible but might be overhyped. I'm generally trusting, so perhaps a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Attractiveness could be low if the visuals aren't appealing or if the message doesn't connect with me. Given my reserved nature, maybe a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My monthly income is quite high, so I can afford it, but looking at my education and occupation as a student, perhaps I'm more cautious about spending. Also, being helpful and unselfish doesn't strongly align here. So, maybe 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Trying might be influenced by the ad's effectiveness and whether others recommend it. Without strong motivation, perhaps a 3 as well.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering is possible if there are positive reviews or if I feel the benefits are real. Maybe a 4 here since it's within my means and addresses some needs.
