Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 25-year-old guy from China working as a managerial employee with a monthly income of around 16-25 million VND. That's decent but not super high. Living with my parents, so maybe I have some influence on household purchases but also need to consider their preferences.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, that targets two main things—energy and appearance. Since I'm in a managerial role, staying energized could be appealing, especially if it's something that can help me perform better at work. But looking my best... Well, I might not prioritize that as much since I don't have a flashy job where appearance is everything.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing but neutral on being reserved. Not very helpful or trusting—so maybe the ad doesn't appeal to those traits. It says I tend to be careless and sometimes rude. That makes me think the product might not align with someone who values social niceties highly. But it's also about being original and having an active imagination, which could relate to wanting something that stands out or offers a unique benefit.

The ad's main selling points are energy and looking good daily. For me, energy is important, especially with a busy job. The drink might be seen as a tool to help me stay focused and productive. But the "look your best" part feels more superficial—maybe I don't think about my appearance that much, or perhaps I do, but it's not the top priority.

I also worry a lot and get nervous easily, so maybe stress-relief aspects would matter, but this ad doesn't touch on that. It focuses more on external appearances rather than internal benefits like reducing anxiety or improving mood.

Considering purchase intention: I'm not really motivated by looking good, but if the drink actually helps with energy, which is crucial for my job, it might be worth trying. However, I tend to be careless and sometimes make impulsive decisions, so maybe I wouldn't follow through on buying it unless there's a strong reason.

So, in terms of attitude toward the ad: It's somewhat interesting because it targets things that matter to me (energy) but doesn't resonate strongly with my personality traits. Purchase intention is low because while the energy aspect is appealing, other factors don't align as well, and I might not be convinced enough to buy.
