Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality.

They're a Chinese male in his 30s with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker, divorced, earning between 36-45 million VND per month. That's about $1,452 to $1,793 USD, which is decent but not extremely high income.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing, Sociable: Disagree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and Unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes Rude: Disagree
- Thorough Job: Disagree
- Makes Plans and Follows Through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Gets Nervous Easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worry a Lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Agree
- Active Imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, New Ideas: Disagree
- Artistic Interests: Neutral

So this person is talkative but not outgoing or reserved. They're not helpful, trusting, or rude—they’re probably quite self-reliant. They make plans and stick to them, are thorough, and not careless. They’re emotionally stable but don't have an active imagination or care much about being original or artistic.

The advertisement is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

I need to assess how this person would feel about the ad and their purchase intention.

First, let's consider the ad's message. It focuses on energy and looking good. For a blue-collar worker, staying energetic makes sense as it relates to productivity. However, "look your best" might be more relevant to someone concerned with appearance or social image, which doesn't seem to align with this person's traits.

Personality-wise, since he is not outgoing or sociable, perhaps looking good isn't a top priority for him. He’s more about being talkative but not necessarily seeking social validation through appearance. Also, he's emotionally stable and not someone who worries a lot, so maybe the energetic part doesn’t resonate as much.

Looking at his traits, he is talkative which might make him engage in conversations, but since he isn't outgoing or helpful, maybe the ad's message about looking good doesn't appeal to him. He’s focused on planning and following through, so maybe he values products that help him maintain a routine, but this ad seems more about appearance.

His emotional stability suggests he's not easily swayed by ads that play on fear or anxiety. The ad is positive but perhaps too much about looking good without practical benefits.

For purchase intention, since he's a blue-collar worker with a decent income, maybe the price point isn't an issue, but if the product is marketed towards appearance rather than functionality, it might not appeal. He’s also not someone who is original or imaginative, so the ad's message might not connect with him deeply.

So for ad attitude:

1. I like the ad: Maybe a 3 because it's positive but doesn't align with his values.
2. Interesting: Perhaps a 4 since it's a common ad theme but not unique.
3. Good: A 5, as it's well-made but doesn't resonate personally.
4. Attractive: A 6, maybe visually appealing but the message doesn't click.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Probably low, maybe a 2, since he might not feel the need for such a product.
2. Try: Maybe a 3, if it's recommended or convenient.
3. Consider: Perhaps a 4, as he might think about it but isn't convinced.

I should make sure these scores reflect his personality accurately. Since he values planning and following through, maybe he would consider the product if it fits into his routine, but the focus on appearance doesn't align with his traits.
