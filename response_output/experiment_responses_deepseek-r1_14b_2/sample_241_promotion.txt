Alright, let me break down how I arrived at each score. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking best, which aligns with health-conscious values, especially for someone over 60 who might prioritize vitality. However, given her reserved nature and being a civil servant, she might not find it overly exciting. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but perhaps too generic. It doesn't stand out enough to capture interest beyond the basic appeal. A 4 seems appropriate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The content is positive and makes sense for health, so it's believable. However, without strong emotional resonance, it might not feel exceptional. A 5 reflects moderate belief.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: While the message is appealing, the lack of specific details or emotional depth might make it less attractive to someone who values thoroughness and isn't easily swayed by typical ads. So, a 3 here.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Her cautious nature and careful approach mean she's not quick to buy without more info. A 2 reflects low intent initially.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: There's some interest due to the benefits mentioned, but she might wait for more reviews or information before trying it. A 3 seems right.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: The ad does spark consideration, especially since the benefits align with her lifestyle needs. A 4 shows that while not immediately convinced, she's open to thinking about it.
