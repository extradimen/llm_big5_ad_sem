Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target demographic is a 50-59-year-old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker, living with his parents, earning around 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's talkative but reserved, sometimes rude, tends to be careless and nervous, worries a lot, has an active imagination, but isn't original or artistic.

Starting with the ad itself: The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. For someone who's in their 50s, maybe they're concerned about energy levels, especially if they have a demanding job as a blue-collar worker. However, considering he's described as reserved and sometimes rude, but also talkative, I wonder how the ad speaks to his social needs.

He might not be very outgoing, so the ad's focus on appearing dull might resonate if he values others' perceptions of him. But since he tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, perhaps the idea of feeling tired is more relevant. However, he also worries a lot and has an active imagination, which could make him susceptible to ads that play into his fears or insecurities.

Now, thinking about whether he likes the ad: He's reserved but talkative. The ad is trying to create a need by highlighting negative outcomes without the product. His personality traits like being sometimes rude and careless might make him less trusting of such claims, so he might not strongly like it. Maybe a 3 or 4 on the scale.

Is the ad interesting? Considering his active imagination, maybe the message is somewhat intriguing, but since he's neutral towards trusting things, it might not hold his interest much. Perhaps around a 3-4.

Believes the ad is good: His tendency to worry and having an active imagination could make him more susceptible to believing such claims, but his critical side (being careless) might make him question its validity. Maybe around a 3 or 4 again.

Attractive? The visual aspect isn't described, so it's hard to say, but the message is about looking dull, which he might find somewhat relevant but not necessarily attractive. Perhaps a low score here, maybe a 2-3.

Moving on to purchase intention: He has a thorough job but tends to be careless and sometimes makes plans without following through. His income suggests he can afford such products, but his tendency to be careless and make hasty decisions might affect his likelihood to buy. Also, as someone living with parents, maybe family opinions influence him, but since the ad is more about personal appearance and energy, it's directly targeting him.

Intend to purchase: He might not have a strong intention because he's cautious about trusting ads. Maybe around 3-4.

Try to buy: If something catches his attention, he might consider trying it once, perhaps a slightly higher score than intent, like 4 or 5.

Consider buying: He might think about it more seriously if the product seems useful, but given his traits, it's uncertain. Maybe another middle score, say around 4.

So putting it all together, I'd estimate:

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like: 3
2. Interesting: 3
3. Good: 3
4. Attractive: 3

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 4
2. Try: 5
3. Consider: 4

But wait, maybe the attractive score should be lower because the message might not appeal to a reserved person as much. So perhaps:

Attractive: 2.

So final scores would adjust accordingly.
