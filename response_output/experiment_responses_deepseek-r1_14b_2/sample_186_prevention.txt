Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **Like**: The ad's message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable concerns. Given that I'm a blue-collar worker, staying energetic makes sense, so I agree it's okay but not overly likable.
2. **Interesting**: The concept of linking tiredness to a drink isn't new for me. I don't find it particularly engaging or novel, so my interest is neutral.
3. **Good**: As someone who values trust and has some skepticism, the ad doesn't provide enough evidence or details about the product's effectiveness. My stance is middle-of-the-road.
4. **Attractive**: The message is clear but not visually appealing to me, especially since I prefer more practical ads.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to Purchase**: Without strong evidence of the drink's benefits and given my limited income, I'm hesitant to commit to buying it.
2. **Try to Buy**: The ad's points are somewhat relevant, but without seeing proof or a recommendation, I don't feel compelled to try it.
3. **Consider Buying**: There's some merit in avoiding tiredness, so I might think about it under the right circumstances, like needing more energy.

Overall, the ad touches on my concerns but doesn't provide enough compelling reasons for me to act on purchasing the product.
