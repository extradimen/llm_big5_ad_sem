Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a male from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree, which is a bit unusual but okay. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND, so I'm not exactly flush with cash. I'm single/divorced, which might affect my lifestyle choices.

Looking at the personality traits: I'm talkative (Strongly Agree), which means I enjoy interactions and communication. However, I'm outgoing and sociable? Strongly Disagree. So while I like talking, I'm more reserved in social settings. That's a bit of a contradiction but manageable.

I'm helpful and unselfish (Agree) – so community-oriented. But generally trusting? Strongly Disagree. Hmm, that could make me cautious about ads and brands. Sometimes rude? Strongly Disagree again. So I'm polite, which is good to know.

I do thorough jobs (Strongly Agree), so attention to detail is important. Planning and following through (Strongly Agree) suggests I like structure and commitment. Careless? Disagree, so I'm careful in my actions.

Nervous easily? Disagree – not too anxious. Worry a lot? Agree – so I have some tendency to stress. Emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), which balances that out. Active imagination? Strongly Disagree – so maybe not the most creative type. Original and idea-come up with new ideas (Strongly Agree) – interesting, as I value innovation but lack an active imagination.

Artistic interests? Agree – so moderate interest in arts.

Now, evaluating the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message is about preventing tiredness and maintaining a good appearance. As someone who's thorough and plans well, avoiding tiredness could help me stay efficient. But I'm cautious (Strongly Disagree on trusting), so I might question the ad's credibility.

I worry a lot but am emotionally stable. So stress about tiredness is real, but I might be skeptical of quick fixes. The drink is positioned as essential for energy and appearance – appealing to someone who values looking good and being energetic, especially in social or professional settings.

Given my personality, I'm helpful but cautious. The ad's message aligns with wanting to maintain a good image and avoid tiredness, which could be important for me socially. However, my skepticism might make me question the drink's effectiveness. Also, considering my income level, it's more affordable than 15 million VND, so price-wise it might not be an issue.

Purchase intention: I might consider buying because of the benefits mentioned, but my cautious nature and tendency to worry could make me look for more evidence or try other methods first. But since I'm thorough and plan well, maybe I'll give it a shot after some research.
