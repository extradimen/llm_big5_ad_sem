Okay, let me break down how I came up with these scores. Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **Like the Ad**: The advertisement mentions feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Given my personality traits, especially being talkative but reserved, I might not resonate much with this because it feels a bit too direct. So, maybe a 4.

2. **Interesting**: Interestingness depends on relevance. Since I'm older and perhaps more set in my habits, ads targeting vitality or appearance might not catch my interest as much, so around 3.

3. **Good**: To judge if the ad is good, I think about clarity and effectiveness. It's clear but maybe a bit generic. A middle score like 4 seems fair.

4. **Attractive**: The visual aspects aren't described, but based on the message alone, it might not be visually appealing enough for me, so perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to Purchase**: I'm cautious about new products and have high income, but also tend to worry a lot. Maybe a 4 as I'm somewhat interested but not fully convinced.

2. **Try to Buy**: Trying might depend on the ad's persuasiveness. Since I find it somewhat interesting, maybe 5.

3. **Consider Buying**: Considering is more about evaluating options. Given my tendency to be careless and make plans without following through, perhaps a 4.
