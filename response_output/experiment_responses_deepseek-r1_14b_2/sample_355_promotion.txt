Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intention based on their demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It seems to target people who want energy and appearance benefits. 

Now, looking at the person's demographics: they're a Chinese-speaking female under 20 with a bachelor’s degree, working as a civil servant, living with parents, and earning over 46 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so she can afford premium products.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Rude: Disagree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Make plans/follow through: Strongly Disagree
- Careless: Neutral
- Nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original/new ideas: Neutral
- Artistic interests: Neutral

So she's not talkative or outgoing, which makes her more reserved. She’s trusting and emotionally stable but not very helpful or unselfish. She tends to make plans but doesn’t follow through, so maybe she's a bit disorganized or lacks discipline.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
She might not find it appealing because she's not outgoing or talkative. The ad is probably energetic and aimed at more social people. Since she’s reserved, she might not connect with it.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
The ad highlights energy and looking good. She values trust and emotional stability but isn’t into new ideas or creativity. Maybe the ad isn't exciting enough for her.

3. I believe the ad is good.
Trust is important to her. If the ad is truthful and presents real benefits, she might find it believable. But if it's too exaggerated, she might not.

4. I find the ad attractive.
She’s emotionally stable but not necessarily drawn to ads that emphasize social aspects or energy since she's more reserved. The visual appeal of the ad matters, but without details, it's hard to say.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
She earns a good income, so price might not be an issue. However, her personality traits like being unhelpful and sometimes careless could make her less likely to prioritize such products. Also, she doesn’t plan well, so maybe she doesn't see the need.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Trying something new might require her to take initiative, which she lacks since she doesn't follow through on plans. So probably not.

3. I will consider buying this product.
Considering it is possible if the ad makes a strong case. But given her reserved nature and other traits, she might not be motivated enough to actually buy it.

Scores:
- Ad attitude: 2, 3, 4, 3
- Purchase intention: 3, 2, 3
