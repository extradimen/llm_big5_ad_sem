Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let's break down the information given.

First, the person is a Chinese male in his 20s with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, single, earning less than 15 million VND per month. His personality traits are important here: he strongly disagrees that he's talkative or reserved, which suggests he's not very outgoing but perhaps more introverted. However, he strongly agrees that he's outgoing and sociable. Wait, that seems contradictory—maybe I misread. Let me check.

Wait, no, the first trait is "I am talkative." He strongly disagrees. Then "I am outgoing, sociable," he strongly agrees. So he's not talkative but is outgoing and sociable. That might mean he prefers interactions in groups or social settings but isn't necessarily the life of the party.

He's helpful and unselfish, agreeing to that. Trusting? He disagrees. Sometimes rude? Strongly disagree. Thorough job? Neutral. Makes plans and follows through? Neutral. Careless? Strongly disagree. Gets nervous easily: strongly agree. Worries a lot: agrees. Emotionally stable: agrees. Active imagination: strongly disagree. Original, comes up with ideas: agree. Few artistic interests: agree.

So he's someone who values being helpful, not very trusting, gets nervous easily but is emotionally stable. He's original but not very imaginative or artistically inclined. He doesn't make plans often but isn't careless either.

Now the ad targets feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. So it's a prevention message—preventing tiredness and dull appearance. The user's background as a civil servant might mean he has a busy job, maybe dealing with stress or long hours, so staying alert is important.

Looking at his personality: being outgoing but not talkative, perhaps he values social interactions but isn't the most vocal. He gets nervous easily, which might make him more concerned about appearances in social settings. Being emotionally stable and helpful suggests he's reliable but maybe sensitive to how others perceive him.

The ad's message is about looking dull without the drink—so it's playing on his desire to maintain a good image, perhaps especially in professional or social contexts as a civil servant. It could appeal to his need to feel confident and presentable.

For the ad attitude: he might find it interesting if it addresses his concerns about appearing tired, but maybe not too likeable because prevention ads can sometimes feel pushy. Whether he believes the ad is good depends on how relatable the message is. He's more likely to find it attractive if it aligns with his desire for social approval.

Purchase intention: Intend to purchase—maybe not high unless the ad strongly resonates. Trying or considering might be higher because prevention products can be considered as optional but useful.

Wait, but he gets nervous easily and worries a lot, so maybe this ad taps into those anxieties about looking tired, which could make him more likely to consider it. However, being emotionally stable might mean he doesn't get overwhelmed by such ads. His originality could mean he's open to trying new things if the product seems effective.

So, for the ad态度 scores: He might find it somewhat interesting and good but not extremely likeable or attractive. For purchase intention: maybe neutral on intent but more inclined to consider buying after thinking about it.
