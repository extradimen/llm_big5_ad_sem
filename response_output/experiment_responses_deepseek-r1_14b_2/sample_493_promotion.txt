Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me start by understanding my profile. I'm from China, female, over 60, have a high school education, am a student, divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing (Strongly Disagree), reserved (Neutral), helpful (Neutral), trusting (Neutral), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), thorough (Neutral), planful (Agree), careless (Strongly Disagree), nervous (Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Disagree), has an active imagination (Agree), original and creative (Disagree), and artistic interests (Disagree).

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate this based on the given 7-point scale for both attitude toward the ad and purchase intention.

Starting with attitude:

1. Like the ad: The ad is positive, but since I'm over 60, maybe I don't relate as much to energy drinks. Also, being reserved and sometimes rude might make me less interested in ads that are too upbeat. So, probably a lower score, like 3.

2. Interesting: It claims benefits for energy and appearance, which could be appealing but not necessarily interesting enough given my personality. Maybe around 4.

3. Good: The message is clear, but I'm cautious about health products. Not sure if it's trustworthy. Maybe 4 or 5.

4. Attractive: The ad sounds good, but as a student on a budget, the price might be an issue. So, maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Even though the benefits are appealing, I'm not sure about the cost and effectiveness. Probably a 3.

2. Try to buy: Might consider it if available, but probably not immediately. Maybe also a 3.

3. Consider buying: It's on my mind, but I'll wait for more information or a discount. Maybe a 4.

So putting it all together:
