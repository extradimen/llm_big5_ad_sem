Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad's message focuses on avoiding tiredness and looking dull without the drink. While it's a common approach, I feel it might be too generic and overused. It doesn't particularly resonate with me because I'm not as concerned about appearing energetic all the time.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept isn't new to me; I've seen similar ads before. So, it's not particularly interesting or innovative.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the message is clear, it lacks depth and emotional appeal. It doesn't make a strong case for why this drink is better than others.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals might be appealing, but the core message doesn't draw me in enough to feel attracted to it.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: I'm more inclined towards products that offer long-term benefits rather than short fixes. This drink seems like a quick solution without convincing evidence of its effectiveness.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong reasons or personal need, there's no compelling reason for me to seek it out.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It might be considered if I ever feel the need, but it's not at the forefront of my mind.

Overall, while the ad is functional, it doesn't align with my values or lifestyle enough to drive purchase intent.
