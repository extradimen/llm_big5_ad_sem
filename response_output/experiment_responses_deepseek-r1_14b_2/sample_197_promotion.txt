Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance. As a 30-39 year old male in China who's married and has a high income, I'm probably looking for products that fit into a busy lifestyle but also offer some vanity benefits.

Starting with the ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad.** - I score this a 4. The message is clear, but it feels a bit generic. I don't see anything particularly innovative or exciting here. It's just stating two common benefits of energy drinks.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Also a 4. While it's not uninteresting, there's nothing that really stands out or captures my attention in a unique way.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - I give this a 5 because the message is positive and focuses on health and appearance, which are important to many people. It's straightforward and easy to understand.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Another 5 here. The ad is visually appealing with its design, but without seeing the actual visuals, it's hard to say if it's truly attractive beyond the text.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - A 3. While the benefits are appealing, there are so many similar products out there that I don't feel a strong personal need or desire to buy this specific one.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Also a 3. Maybe if I saw it in a store and was reminded of the ad, but without more compelling reasons, it's not a top priority.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - A 5 here because the benefits do align with what many people look for, so it's something that could be on my consideration list, especially if the price is right or there's a promotion.

Overall, while the ad isn't bad, it doesn't resonate strongly with me personally. I'm more focused on other aspects of health and wellness, and without seeing any unique selling points in the ad, my interest is lukewarm.
