Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

First, considering my demographic profile: I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, currently divorced, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative but not outgoing, helpful and unselfish, generally distrustful, sometimes rude, careless, emotionally stable (which I'm not), and having few artistic interests.

The ad's message is that without this drink, one might feel tired and look dull. 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad seems to target feelings of fatigue and a desire to appear energetic. While these are relatable, I'm not convinced by the claim as it's too vague. The benefits aren't clearly explained, making it hard for me to connect emotionally. So, I'd score this around 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept isn't particularly engaging or unique. It doesn't stand out from other similar ads and doesn't trigger my interest. Thus, a score of 3 seems appropriate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: To believe an ad, I need to trust its message. Given my tendency to distrust (Strongly Disagree), and since the ad lacks detailed evidence or credibility, I wouldn't find it trustworthy. A 2 here makes sense.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Attractiveness in ads usually comes from compelling visuals or a strong emotional hook. The message is basic and doesn't resonate with me deeply. So, scoring it a 3 feels right.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Without clear evidence of the drink's benefits, I'm skeptical. My cautious nature (Strongly Disagree in trusting) makes me less likely to buy immediately. A score of 2 fits here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Trying a product usually requires some level of belief or curiosity. Since the ad doesn't provide enough reason to believe, I'm hesitant to even consider trying it. Thus, a 3 might be too high; perhaps a 4 if I were more open, but given my skepticism, maybe a lower score? Wait, no—if the first is 2 (low intent), this should reflect a slightly higher consideration without strong conviction, so maybe a 4.

Wait, actually, let me rethink. If I'm not intending to purchase, trying would be even less likely. So perhaps both scores are low. Maybe I should adjust:

1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 2
3. Consider: 3

But the original thought was a 4 for 'try', which might not align with the initial lower score.

Alternatively, considering that without belief, all intentions would be low. So perhaps all purchase scores are around 2-3. But to balance, maybe:

1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 3
3. Consider: 4

Wait, no—intent is lower than trying or considering. So, I think the original thought of [3, 4, 5] might be too high given my distrust and lack of belief.

Perhaps a better approach:

- Intend to purchase: low (2)
- Try: slightly higher but still cautious (3)
- Consider: maybe neutral (4), as I'm not dismissing it entirely but not convinced either.

But I need to ensure consistency with the initial evaluation. Since the ad didn't make me believe in the product, all purchase intentions would be low. So:

1. Intend: 2
2. Try: 3
3. Consider: 4

Wait, considering that 'consider' is a lower bar than trying or intending, perhaps it's higher? Hmm, no—actually, if I'm not intending to buy, I wouldn't try either, so maybe all scores are low.

Alternatively, given the initial evaluation of the ad as somewhat interesting but not believable, my consideration might be neutral (4), while intent and trying would be lower. So perhaps:

1. Intend: 2
2. Try: 3
3. Consider: 4

This way, I'm indicating that while I don't intend to buy or try, I haven't ruled out considering it if more information is provided.

I think this makes sense.
