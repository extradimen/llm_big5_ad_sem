Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the user's background: she's a Chinese female under 20, single, working as a civil servant with a high income, has high school education. Her personality traits show she's talkative, outgoing, but also reserved and helpful. She's not trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in her work, makes plans and follows through, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, neutral on emotional stability, doesn't have an active imagination or original ideas, and has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Let's start with her attitude towards the ad. She likes ads if they resonate with her values. The ad focuses on energy and looking good, which might appeal to someone who values social presentation and maybe has a busy schedule. However, she's reserved and somewhat talkative but outgoing—so perhaps the idea of looking good is important for her socially.

She's not trusting, so the credibility of the ad might be in question. Does the ad have any trustworthy elements? Maybe if it's from a known brand, but since we don't know that here, she might be skeptical. 

Her tendency to worry and get nervous suggests she might be concerned about the product's safety or effectiveness. She's also thorough, so she would want evidence or clear benefits.

For purchase intention: she makes plans and follows through, so if she's convinced, she might intend to buy. But she's sometimes careless, so maybe not as committed. Her high income might mean she can afford it, but her personality traits like being helpful and unselfish might make her prioritize other things over this drink.

Looking at the 7-point scale:

1. I like the ad. – Maybe a 3. It's okay but doesn't strongly resonate.
2. Interesting? Perhaps 4. Not very compelling, but slightly interesting.
3. Good: 5. It has positive messages, but not outstanding.
4. Attractive: 6. The idea of looking good and being energized is appealing.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: 4. She's considering but not sure.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 5. If she feels the benefits, she might try it.
3. Consider buying: 6. It’s on her radar.

Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Let me think again. Since she tends to worry and is not trusting, maybe her intent is lower. So perhaps:

Purchase intentions might be lower because of skepticism. Maybe:

1. Intend: 4
2. Try: 5
3. Consider: 6

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers here.

Alternatively, considering she's thorough and makes plans, but also worried, maybe:

Ad attitude scores: 4,4,5,6

Purchase intentions: 4,5,6

I think that's a reasonable estimate.
