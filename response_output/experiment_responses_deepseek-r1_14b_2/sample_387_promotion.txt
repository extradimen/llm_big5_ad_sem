Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman over 60 with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker and married. My monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND.

Let me think about the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'm talkative but reserved, so maybe the message needs more depth. Since I'm outgoing? No, I'm actually strongly disagreeing on being outgoing; I'm reserved. So maybe an ad that's more personal or has a story might connect better.

I'm helpful and unselfish, so perhaps an ad highlighting community or shared benefits could resonate. But this ad is individual-focused, which might not hit the mark for me as much.

I trust people strongly, so credibility is key. The ad should come from a trustworthy brand. If it's just any brand without clear trustworthiness, I might be skeptical.

I sometimes get nervous easily and worry a lot but am emotionally stable. So stress-relief or stability messages could be appealing, but this ad is about energy and looking good, which might not directly address my concerns.

I'm thorough in jobs but disagree with making plans, so maybe the drink's effectiveness over time matters to me. I need something that consistently works daily.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. Like: The message is positive but may be too generic for me. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: Doesn't stand out; a 4.
3. Good: It's decent but not compelling—maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: Not visually appealing or unique, so perhaps a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: I don't feel strongly enough yet—maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: Might consider once, maybe a 3.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, but not sure—perhaps a 4.

So the scores might be [3,4,5,4] for attitude and [4,3,4] for purchase intention.
