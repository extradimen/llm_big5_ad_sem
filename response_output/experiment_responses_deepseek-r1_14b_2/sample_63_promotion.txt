Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Given my personality, I'm not very talkative and tend to be reserved, but I am outgoing in some ways. The advertisement is energetic and positive, which might appeal to someone more extroverted or less reserved than me. However, since I'm somewhat reserved and don't find such ads particularly exciting, I only give it a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad's message about staying energized and looking your best is appealing on a surface level, but it doesn't speak to my deeper concerns or values. My high worry tendency makes me skeptical of such claims without more evidence. So, I'm somewhat interested but not strongly so—hence a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   For an ad to be "good," it needs to resonate with me and feel credible. The claims made are general and lack specific benefits or proof. My tendency to worry makes me question the product's effectiveness, leading me to score this a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   The visual appeal of the ad matters, but without more context, it's hard to gauge. Since I'm not emotionally swayed easily and am more reserved, I might not find it particularly attractive—so another 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   My high monthly income suggests I can afford such products, but my skepticism towards the ad's claims and my tendency to worry about effectiveness make me hesitant. I don't feel a strong intent to buy, so a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Even though I might not intend to purchase immediately, the idea of trying it isn't completely off the table if I had more information. However, without compelling reasons, it's still low—another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Considering is a middle ground. While I don't have strong feelings either way, I might think about it in certain situations or see more ads. A 4 seems fair here as there's some consideration but no definite decision.
