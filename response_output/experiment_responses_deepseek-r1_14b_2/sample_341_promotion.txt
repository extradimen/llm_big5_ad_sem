Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand her background. She's from China, female, over 60 years old with a high school education. She’s divorced, and her monthly income is more than 46 million VND, which is quite high. Her occupation is listed as "Other," so maybe she's retired or does something else.

Looking at her personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree
- Outgoing/sociable: Disagree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree
- Plans and follows through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Nervous easily: Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original/new ideas: Agree
- Artistic interests: Disagree

So, she's not talkative or outgoing but is reserved. She doesn’t see herself as helpful or trusting, which might make her more skeptical. However, she does a thorough job and makes plans, so she values efficiency and follow-through. She tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, which could mean she’s a bit high-strung. She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas but doesn’t have strong artistic interests.

The advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

I need to evaluate how she would respond to this ad and her purchase intention.

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
2. Interesting.
3. Good.
4. Attractive.

She’s reserved and not very trusting, so she might be skeptical of such ads. The drink claims to help stay energized and look good. Given her age and income level, maybe she's looking for something that provides real benefits without being too flashy.

However, she is thorough and makes plans, so she might appreciate the ad if it presents clear benefits. But since she doesn't like to be talkative or outgoing, perhaps the message isn't targeting her personality traits directly.

She tends to be careless but also gets nervous easily. Maybe the ad's claims are too broad for her to fully trust. She’s not very trusting of ads in general (Strongly Disagree), so that might make her less likely to like it.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy.
2. Try to buy.
3. Consider buying.

She has a high income but is also careful with how she spends her money. The ad's claims are quite strong—staying energized and looking good. She values thoroughness, so if the product delivers, she might be inclined to buy it. However, her skepticism towards ads could make her wait or seek more information before deciding.

She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas, which might make her curious about the drink's benefits but also cautious.

Putting this together:

For ad attitude scores (1-7):

1. Like: She’s reserved and not trusting, so maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The claims are strong; perhaps she finds it interesting as 4.
3. Good: Since she doesn't trust ads much, maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: Not very appealing to her reserved nature, so 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: She might not feel strongly enough to intend purchase right away, so 3.
2. Try: Maybe on the fence, so 4.
3. Consider: Definitely considering it but not sure yet, so 5.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent. Let me think again. She is thorough and makes plans, which might make her more methodical in purchasing decisions. So if she thinks the product could be beneficial, she might intend to try it after some consideration.

Maybe for ad attitude:

1. Like: Maybe a 4? Because the claims are positive, but she's not very trusting.
2. Interesting: Definitely interesting as it targets health and appearance, so maybe 5.
3. Good: It's a simple message, but since she isn't trusting, perhaps 4.
4. Attractive: The ad might be too flashy for her reserved nature; maybe 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: She is thorough and plans, so if convinced, she would intend to buy—maybe 5.
2. Try: Since she's cautious but open, try after some thought—perhaps 4.
3. Consider: Definitely considering it as an option—so 6.

Wait, that might make more sense because her personality traits like thoroughness and following through suggest she would take the time to consider and then act if convinced.

But I'm a bit confused because she's not trusting of ads. So maybe the scores should be lower for ad attitude but higher for purchase intention if the product seems legitimate.
