Alright, let's break this down. I'm evaluating an advertisement for a drink that claims without it, you might feel tired and look dull. So first, considering my background: I'm over 60, married, with a postgraduate degree, living in China, making around 36-45 million VND a month. My personality traits include being reserved, having an active imagination and original ideas, but also sometimes agreeing that I do thorough jobs, though I can be careless at times.

Looking at the ad's message: it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull. For someone my age, this might resonate because as we get older, energy levels can drop, and appearance is something many people care about. The drink is positioned to prevent these negative outcomes. 

Now, evaluating the ad_type as "prevention" makes sense here since it's about avoiding feeling tired or looking dull.

For the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad: Considering my reserved nature, I might not strongly like an ad that's too flashy, but the message is straightforward and addresses real concerns, so maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The concept is simple but effective for its target audience. Maybe a 5.
3. Good: It's functional and truthful in its claims, so a solid 5.
4. Attractive: Not particularly appealing due to being too direct, perhaps a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: While the message is relevant, I'm cautious about new products without more evidence. A 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe on a whim if it's recommended elsewhere, so a 4.
3. Consider buying: It's something that might be considered for its benefits, so a 5.

Overall, the ad speaks to my needs but doesn't quite hit the mark strongly enough for high scores in attitude or a definite purchase intention.
