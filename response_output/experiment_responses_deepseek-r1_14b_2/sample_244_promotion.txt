Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My job is to evaluate how much I like the ad (on a 7-point scale) and then assess my purchase intentions.

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Since I'm outgoing, but also have an active imagination and original ideas, ads that are creative might appeal to me. The message about energy and looking good sounds positive. Maybe I'd like it, so maybe a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad seems to target someone who wants to feel good and look their best. Given my personality traits like being talkative (neutral) but having an active imagination (strongly agree), the ad's message could be seen as interesting, maybe a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   The claims are about energy and appearance. I'm somewhat trusting (strongly agree), so believing in the ad might not be high unless there's more evidence. Maybe around 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Being outgoing, an attractive ad could catch my attention. If it's visually appealing, maybe a higher score like 5 or 6, but without knowing the visuals, I'll go with 5.

Next, purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   I'm neutral on being helpful and unselfish, which might affect how much I care about such products. The ad makes positive claims, but not sure if I'd be convinced enough to buy it immediately. Maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Since I make thorough plans (strongly agree) and am somewhat trusting, maybe I'm more inclined to consider trying it. A 5.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   The claims are appealing, so considering it makes sense. Maybe a higher score like 6.

So putting it all together:
