Alright, let me break down my thought process for evaluating this advertisement. 

First, I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. I'm a managerial employee living with my parents. My personality traits show that I'm outgoing but not talkative, trusting, and have an active imagination. However, I tend to be careless, sometimes rude, and don't make thorough plans.

The ad claims the drink helps stay energized and look your best daily. Since I value looking good and being energetic, this seems relevant. The ad's positive message might appeal to me because of my outgoing nature and desire for improvement.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad: 5 - Neutral. It's a positive message, but not enough to make me strongly like it.
2. Interesting: 5 - Neutral. The benefits are clear, but nothing unique stands out.
3. Good: 6 - Agree. It offers tangible benefits, making it good.
4. Attractive: 7 - Strongly agree. The imagery and message are appealing.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 2 - Disagree. I'm not convinced enough to buy immediately.
2. Will try to buy: 3 - Neutral. Maybe if reminded again, but not a strong commitment.
3. Consider buying: 5 - Agree. The benefits make it worth considering.

Overall, the ad is good and attractive, but my cautious nature makes me hold off on immediate purchase.
