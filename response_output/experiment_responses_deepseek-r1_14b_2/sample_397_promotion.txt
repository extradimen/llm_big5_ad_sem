Alright, I'm a 50-59-year-old woman from China with a postgraduate degree and working in an office. I'm divorced and earn less than 15 million VND a month. My personality traits show I'm not very talkative or outgoing, which means I prefer quieter social settings. I tend to be careless sometimes but do thorough work. I make plans but don't always follow through. I'm emotionally stable but can come off as rude and have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad, it says the drink helps stay energized and look your best daily. Given my reserved nature, an ad that's too energetic might not appeal to me. The benefits are clear—energy and appearance—but since I'm not outgoing, maybe I don't feel the need to "look my best" every day as much. Also, considering my income level, the price of such a drink could be a barrier.

For purchase intention, even if I like the ad, cost might make me reconsider. Plus, I tend to be thorough but sometimes careless, so I might not prioritize this product over others.
