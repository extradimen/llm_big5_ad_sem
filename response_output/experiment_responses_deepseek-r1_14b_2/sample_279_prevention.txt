Alright, let's break down how I approached evaluating this advertisement. First, understanding my demographic and personality traits was crucial. Being a female in her late twenties with a postgraduate degree but working outside the traditional corporate sector, I'm likely looking for products that align with a modern, possibly busy lifestyle.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key message here is about energy and presentation. As someone who values being alert and presentable, especially in social or professional settings, this speaks directly to me. However, my personality traits also play a role. I'm talkative but not outgoing, which might mean I prefer products that enhance my natural energy without feeling forced.

The ad's tone is direct and slightly negative, highlighting what happens if you don't use the product. This could resonate with someone who's cautious about their appearance and energy levels, like me. But considering my tendency to worry a lot and get nervous easily, the message might also feel a bit anxiety-inducing rather than reassuring.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: I find it interesting because it touches on common concerns about tiredness and looking good. It's well-crafted in that sense. However, I'm not sure if I fully agree with the approachâ€”feeling tired is subjective, so the effectiveness might vary. The ad feels good but perhaps a bit over the top in its claims.

Attractiveness-wise, the message is clear, which is a plus. But the emotional appeal might be too strong for my taste. I'm more analytical and might want to see evidence or benefits beyond just looking dull without it.

For purchase intention: The ad makes me consider if this drink could truly improve my energy levels. Since I tend to make plans but sometimes feel careless, maybe I'd try it once. However, the high price range (16-25 million VND) is a significant factor. That's more than just a regular drink; it might be seen as an indulgence rather than a necessity. So while the ad is persuasive in targeting my concerns, the cost and other factors make me hesitant to intend purchasing immediately or feel compelled to try it multiple times.

In summary, the ad effectively targets my fears of tiredness and looking dull, aligning with my personality traits. However, the emotional intensity and cost considerations temper my interest.
