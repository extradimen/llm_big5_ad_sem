Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese female with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down how I would approach this.

First, understanding the demographic profile: I'm under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work as a blue-collar worker, am divorced, and earn between 26-35 million VND monthly. Wait, that income seems high for someone under 20, especially in China. Maybe it's a mistake? Or perhaps the currency conversion is different. But regardless, my income is on the higher side.

Personality traits: I'm talkative (Strongly Disagree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Strongly Disagree). So, I'm quite an extrovert. Helpful and unselfish? Strongly Disagree, so maybe I'm more self-centered. Generally trusting? Also strongly disagree, so I might be skeptical. Sometimes rude? Neutral. Thorough job? No, I don't do thorough jobs. Making plans and following through? Agree. Careless? Neutral. Get nervous easily? Disagree. Worry a lot? Strongly Disagree. Emotionally stable: Agree. Active imagination: Agree. Original with new ideas: Disagree. Few artistic interests: Disagree.

So, personality-wise, I'm outgoing but not helpful or trusting. I make plans but don't follow through thoroughly, and I have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often. Emotionally stable, so probably not easily swayed by emotional ads.

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and dull looks without the drink. It suggests that the product will help you stay energetic and look good.

Attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: The tagline is clear but might be too generic. Since I'm outgoing, maybe it resonates with me because looking good is important in social settings. But given my skepticism, I might not find it compelling enough to like it strongly.
2. Interesting: It's a common message, so maybe not very interesting. Neutral or slightly disagreeable.
3. Good: The ad delivers a clear benefit but lacks unique selling points. Maybe on the lower side of agreement.
4. Attractive: Without any emotional appeal or creativity, it might not be very attractive to me.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: I don't feel strongly enough about the product's benefits to intend buying it.
2. Try to buy: Slightly higher than intent, but still low because the ad doesn't create a strong desire.
3. Consider buying: Maybe neutral or slightly agree, as I might think about it if I see it again, but no immediate action.

I'm thinking that since I don't find the ad very persuasive due to my skeptical nature and outgoing personality expecting more engaging content, my scores would be low to moderate on both attitude and purchase intention.
