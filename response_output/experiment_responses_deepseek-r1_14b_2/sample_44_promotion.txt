Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working in a blue-collar job. I live with my parents and earn around 36–45 million VND monthly. My personality traits are reserved, helpful, trusting but sometimes not, thorough, cautious about plans, not careless, not easily nervous but worry a lot yet emotionally stable, not imaginative, not original, and have few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I like the ad. Let's think—if the ad is energetic and positive, maybe it resonates, but given my reserved nature, I'm neutral towards liking ads in general. However, the message about energy and looking good might appeal to me because of my thoroughness and desire to look presentable. So maybe a 3.

Is the ad interesting? The claims are common, so not very interesting. Maybe a 2.

Is the ad good? It's functional but lacks creativity. Probably a 3.

Is it attractive? Given I'm reserved, maybe neutral again, so 3.

For purchase intention: Do I intend to buy? I'm cautious about trying new products, especially without specific benefits mentioned. So probably a 2.

Will I try to buy it? Maybe not immediately, but if others recommend, perhaps a 3.

Consider buying: The ad makes me think it's worth considering, so maybe a 4.

But wait, the user is blue-collar with high income—maybe she values practicality more. The ad doesn't provide specific evidence or details, which might make her skeptical. So perhaps lower scores for purchase intention.
