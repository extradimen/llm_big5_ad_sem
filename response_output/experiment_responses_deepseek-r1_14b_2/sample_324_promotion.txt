Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, considering the ad's message about staying energized and looking your best, it resonates with someone who values personal appearance and energy levels. However, I'm not particularly interested in such products since I don't place a high priority on beauty or supplements.

Looking at the first attitude score towards the ad: "I like the ad." Since I don't resonate much with the message, my score is low at 2.

Next, "I think the ad is interesting." While it's not uninteresting, it doesn't capture my attention enough. So, another 2.

For "I believe the ad is good," I'm somewhat neutral but leaning towards disagreement because the claims seem a bit generic and overused. That's a 3.

Lastly, "I find the ad attractive." The visuals might be appealing, but the core message doesn't attract me personally. So, it gets a 2 again.

Moving on to purchase intention: 

"I intend to purchase this product." Definitely not; my score is 1 here.
 
"I will try to buy this product." No interest at all, so another 1.

For "I will consider buying this product," there's no consideration at all, hence a 1 as well.

Overall, the ad doesn't connect with me on a personal level, and I don't see myself purchasing the product based on the given traits.
