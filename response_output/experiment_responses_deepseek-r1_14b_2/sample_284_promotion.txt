Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 20-29 year old male from China with a postgraduate degree, currently a student living with my parents and earning about 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), reserved (strongly agree), sometimes rude (neutral), thorough in my work (strongly agree), but generally not trusting (strongly disagree) and emotionally stable (neutral).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points are energy and appearance. Since I'm a student, staying energized could be appealing, especially with exams or long study hours. But looking my best might not be as much of a priority for me right now.

Personality-wise, being reserved and sometimes rude makes me less likely to care about social image through products like this. Also, I worry a lot and get nervous easily, but the ad doesn't address those emotional states. The drink's benefits are practical, which I might appreciate, but my reserved nature might make me less interested in using it for social reasons.

Purchase intention: While the energy aspect is good, especially since I'm a student with busy schedules, the other aspects of looking best don't resonate as much. Plus, I tend to be careful and thorough, so I'd want more information before buying.

Scores:
- Ad attitude: Neutral or slightly below on all counts because it doesn't fully connect with my personality.
- Purchase intention: Neutral on intent but might consider it if needed, hence a 4 for considering.
