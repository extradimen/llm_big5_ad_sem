Okay, so I need to figure out how a Chinese woman in her 40s with a high school education and a blue-collar job would perceive this ad. Let's break it down.

First, the advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with her background: She's single, earns between 26-35 million VND monthly, which is on the higher side for a blue-collar worker in China. That might mean she values products that offer visible benefits or convenience.

Her personality traits: She agrees she's outgoing and helpful but neutral about being reserved. She strongly trusts people, which could make her more likely to believe the ad if it comes from a trusted source. She disagrees with being talkative and sometimes rude, so she's probably more of a friendly person. She's emotionally stable but tends to get nervous easily.

Now, evaluating the ad: It promises energy and looking good daily. These are appealing benefits for someone who might be juggling work and personal life. Since she's outgoing, she might appreciate the social aspect of looking her best.

But does she trust the ad? Trust is a big factor here. She strongly agrees with being trusting, so if the ad seems credible, she might believe it. However, if there's no evidence or clear benefits explained, she might be skeptical.

Looking at purchase intention: The ad targets energy and appearance, which are relevant to her lifestyle. But without knowing how effective the drink is, she might not feel compelled to buy immediately. She’s practical and values thoroughness, so she’d probably want more information before deciding.

She scores herself as neutral on making plans and being careless, which means she's organized but not impulsive. So, she might consider buying after thinking it through.

Her emotional stability is high, but she gets nervous easily, which might make her cautious about new products or ads that seem too good to be true.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: It's positive and claims benefits that matter to her, so she might like it as an interesting and good idea. But without more details, she might not find it extremely attractive.

For purchase intention: She might intend to buy if convinced, but trying or considering would require more thought or evidence.
