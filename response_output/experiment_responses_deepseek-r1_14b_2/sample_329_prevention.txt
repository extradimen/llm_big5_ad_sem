Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as the virtual person described. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My task is to score my attitude toward the ad and my purchase intentions on a 7-point scale.

First, let's break down the demographic profile. I'm a Chinese male in my late 20s with a postgraduate degree, working as an office worker, currently divorced, and earning over 46 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income, so maybe that affects what products I consider. Also, personality-wise, I'm outgoing, talkative, have an active imagination, and original ideas but tend to disagree with being helpful or trusting.

The ad seems to be targeting people who might feel tired and look dull without the drink. It’s probably a product aimed at enhancing energy or appearance. Since I’m an office worker, maybe long hours could make me tired, so this could be relevant.

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is straightforward but maybe a bit cliché. As someone who values originality, I might not find it very appealing. But the idea of feeling tired without the drink is relatable, especially in an office setting where energy is important. So maybe a 4.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - It's not particularly innovative. The concept is common in energy drinks. But it does tap into a real need, so perhaps a middle score like 3.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Believability depends on how much I trust such claims. Since I'm generally distrustful (Disagree), I might not fully believe it's effective. Maybe a 4 because it makes sense but isn't compelling.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Visual appeal and creativity matter. If the ad is just text, it's not very attractive. But if it has engaging visuals, maybe higher. Without more info, I'll go with a neutral score of 3.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intention depends on whether I feel it solves my problem. If the drink actually works, yes. But given my skepticism, maybe not strongly intended. A 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying once is different from intending long-term. Maybe a bit more likely, so 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is the first step. Given the message's relevance, it might be on my list. So perhaps a 5.

Wait, but let me think again about the ad's appeal. Since I'm outgoing and like new ideas, maybe the ad could be more creative. If it uses humor or original visuals, I might rate higher. But if it's generic, then lower.

Purchase intention: With a high income, maybe I don't need to buy such products often, but if effective, why not? So considering is more likely than intending immediately.
