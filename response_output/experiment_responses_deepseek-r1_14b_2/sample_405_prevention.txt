Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 50-59-year-old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working in blue-collar and currently divorced. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is a significant amount, so I'm likely more financially stable.

Looking at my personality traits: I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, and also generally trusting. But I'm not talkative or outgoing, which might make me more reserved in social settings. I do a thorough job but don't make plans often. I tend to be careless sometimes and have an active imagination.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting people who want to avoid feeling tired or looking unattractive because of that. 

Starting with the attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, the message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, maybe this drink could help me stay energized during long shifts. But the ad feels a bit negative, focusing on what happens without it. I don't know if I'd "like" it, but it might be useful.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, especially in demanding jobs. So maybe it's interesting because it addresses real concerns.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's straightforward but lacks a compelling reason to choose this drink over others. There are many energy drinks; what makes this one better?

4. Is the ad attractive? The message is clear, but it could be more engaging with visuals or a stronger emotional appeal.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: I'm cautious about new products. Without knowing more benefits, I'm not sure if I'd buy it immediately.

2. Will I try to buy it? Maybe, if the ad's message resonates enough and there are offers available.

3. Consider buying: It could be a consideration, especially if others recommend it or if I see consistent positive reviews.
