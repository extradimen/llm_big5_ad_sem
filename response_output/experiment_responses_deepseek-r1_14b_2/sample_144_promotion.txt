Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, that's the main message. It's targeting people who want energy and good looks daily. Now, considering my background, I'm a young female from China, still in high school, working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, earning less than 15 million VND a month. My personality is talkative but not outgoing, reserved, very helpful and unselfish, not trusting, never rude, thorough, good at following plans, sometimes careless, not nervous, don't worry much, stable emotionally, not very imaginative, but original with ideas.

So, the ad's main points are energy and looking good. As a student or someone working, staying energized is important. But I'm reserved and not outgoing, so maybe the "look your best" part isn't as crucial for me. However, being helpful and unselfish, maybe the idea of feeling better to help others is positive.

I think about whether the ad resonates with me. The drink sounds like it's for people who are busy or active, which could be relevant since I might need energy for school or work. But I'm also careful and thorough, so I'd probably want more information before trusting the product.

Looking at the attitude questions:
1. Do I like the ad? It's simple but maybe a bit too general. Not sure if it appeals to me personally. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting? It's not particularly unique or attention-grabbing, so maybe a 4.
3. Good? As an advertisement, it seems okay but not impressive. Perhaps a 5.
4. Attractive? The visuals might matter, but since I'm text-focused here, I'll assume it's neutral, so maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Not sure yet; need more info. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy? If I see it in stores, maybe I'd consider trying once. A 4.
3. Consider buying? It might be an option if the price is right, so a 5.

I think my scores would reflect that I'm somewhat interested but not strongly convinced yet.
