Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience here seems to be someone who is concerned about their energy levels and appearance. The person in question has a high income, so they might be looking for premium products, but also value social image.

Looking at their personality traits: They are outgoing and talkative, which means they probably care about how others perceive them. However, they disagree with being helpful and unselfish, suggesting they might prioritize themselves over others. They strongly agree with having an active imagination and originality, so they might appreciate creative ads but could be critical if the ad feels generic.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:
1. Do I like the ad? Well, the message is about not feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's a common concern for someone who's outgoing. Since they value social image, it's likely to resonate. They might agree (maybe 4 or 5).
2. Is the ad interesting? The concept is straightforward but effective. Maybe a middle score like 5.
3. Is the ad good? The message is clear, but maybe not very original. Perhaps a 4 or 5.
4. Is the ad attractive? With high income and a focus on image, it might be seen as somewhat attractive, maybe a 6.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: They are thorough and make plans, so if they find value, they might intend to buy (maybe a 6).
2. Will try to buy: If the ad makes them think the product is essential, they might try it (perhaps 5).
3. Consider buying: Given their income level, they might be more cautious but still consider it (maybe 4).

Putting it all together, I'll assign scores based on these thoughts.
