Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me recap their demographic and personality traits. They're a middle-aged Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, working in an office, divorced, earning around 36-45 million VND per month. Their personality is quite talkative and outgoing, which means they probably enjoy social interactions and might be someone who values being seen positively in social settings.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Agree
- Artistic interests: Neutral

So, from this, the person is quite an extrovert but not very trusting or helpful. He gets nervous easily and tends to be a bit careless. He's also someone who makes plans but might not always follow through thoroughly.

Now, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target feelings of fatigue and social image. The ad is probably positioned as an energy booster that helps maintain a vibrant appearance, which would appeal to someone who values their social image and doesn't want to appear tired or unattractive.

Considering his personality:

1. Being talkative and outgoing means he cares about how others perceive him. So, the idea of looking dull might resonate because he wants to make a good impression.
2. However, his tendency to get nervous easily suggests that maybe social interactions are somewhat stressful for him. If this drink can help reduce tiredness or boost energy, it could alleviate some of those feelings.
3. He's not very trusting and tends to be helpful/unselfish, so the ad might not immediately gain his trust unless he feels it genuinely addresses his needs.
4. The part about feeling tired is something relatable for office workers, especially given his occupation. Long hours or stressful work could lead to fatigue.

On the other hand, he's somewhat careless and agrees that he tends to be a bit rough. He might not see the drink as essential but more of a luxury. However, since he makes plans and follows through, maybe he values products that help him maintain his lifestyle and social image.

So for attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: Maybe 5 or 6 because it's relevant to his social needs, but not sure if he trusts the claim.
2. Interesting: Perhaps a 4. The message is clear, but it might feel too generic.
3. Good: Maybe 4 again; it has a good message but lacks something unique.
4. Attractive: Likely a 5 or 6 since it's visually appealing and addresses his image concerns.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Maybe 4 because while the ad speaks to him, he's not very trusting of such claims without more evidence.
2. Try to buy: Could be a 3; perhaps he might give it a try if it's conveniently available.
3. Consider buying: Likely a 5 because it addresses his needs, but he needs more convincing.

I think the ad would have a moderate impact on him. He's not immediately sold but is open to considering it, especially since it aligns with his social and energetic personality.
