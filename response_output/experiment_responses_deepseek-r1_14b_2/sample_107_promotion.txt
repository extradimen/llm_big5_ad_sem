Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a married managerial employee from China with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. This puts me in a relatively high-income bracket, which might influence my purchasing decisions towards higher-quality or premium products.

Looking at my personality traits:

- **Talkative**: Disagree
- **Outgoing, Sociable**: Agree
- **Reserved**: Strongly Agree
- **Helpful and Unselfish**: Disagree
- **Trusting**: Disagree
- **Sometimes Rude**: Disagree
- **Thorough Job**: Disagree
- **Makes Plans and Follows Through**: Strongly Disagree
- **Careless**: Strongly Disagree
- **Nervous Easily**: Neutral
- **Worry a Lot**: Disagree
- **Emotionally Stable**: Strongly Disagree
- **Active Imagination**: Disagree
- **Original, New Ideas**: Strongly Disagree
- **Artistic Interests**: Agree

Given that I'm reserved and not particularly talkative or helpful, the ad's message about staying energized and looking your best might not resonate with me as much. The ad seems to target someone outgoing and perhaps more social, which doesn't align with my personality.

I tend to be careful and thorough in my actions, but since I strongly disagree with making plans and following through, maybe I'm more methodical but less likely to follow through on purchasing decisions without deeper conviction. However, being reserved might make me less interested in products that emphasize social or energetic aspects.

The ad's message is clear—energy and looking good—but the way it's presented might not appeal to someone like me. Since I'm emotionally stable but have a neutral stance on getting nervous, perhaps the ad doesn't create an emotional connection for me.

Regarding purchase intentions: while I don't intend to buy the product immediately (disagree), I might consider it if it aligns with my needs, hence a 'consider' score of 3. Trying it would be less likely unless there's a strong reason or recommendation.

So, each attitude towards the ad is low because the message doesn't connect with my reserved and less outgoing nature, leading to scores around 2-3. For purchase intentions, without a compelling reason, I'm neutral but slightly leaning towards considering it.
