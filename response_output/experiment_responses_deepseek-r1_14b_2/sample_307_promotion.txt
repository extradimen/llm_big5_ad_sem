Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the demographic profile: I'm from China, female, aged 40-49, have a bachelorâ€™s degree, work as a blue-collar worker, married, with a monthly income under 15 million VND. My personality traits include being outgoing (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Agree), trusting (Agree), but also careless (Strongly Agree) and sometimes rude (Disagree). I make plans and follow through (Strongly Agree).

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is positive, focusing on energy and looking good. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, I might appreciate an ad that promotes a healthy lifestyle. But since I tend to be careless, maybe I won't pay too much attention. So, 3.
2. Is it interesting? The promise of daily benefits could catch my attention if the ad is well-made. Maybe a 4.
3. Do I think it's good? It sounds beneficial, but without specific proof, I'm neutral. A 4.
4. Is it attractive? Visual appeal matters. If it's visually appealing, maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The benefits are tempting, but as a blue-collar worker with budget constraints, the price might be a concern. Maybe a 3.
2. Will I try to buy it? Without trying, I'm not sure if it works. So, also a 3.
3. Will I consider buying? It's something I might think about, especially if others recommend it. A 4.

Putting it all together, the scores would be [3, 4, 4, 5] for attitude and [3, 3, 4] for intention.
