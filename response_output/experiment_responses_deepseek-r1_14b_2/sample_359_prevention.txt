Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, who is divorced and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are: talkative (Agree), outgoing (Disagree), reserved (Strongly Disagree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disgree), trusting (Agree), sometimes rude (Neutral), thorough job (Disgree), makes plans and follows through (Disgree), careless (Strongly Disagree), gets nervous easily (Neutral), worries a lot (Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), has an active imagination (Neutral), original with new ideas (Strongly Disgree), few artistic interests (Disagree).

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." I need to evaluate my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention on a 1-7 scale.

Starting with attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? The tagline is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. As someone who's emotionally stable, maybe this appeals to me as it suggests maintaining energy and appearance. But since I'm not outgoing or helpful, maybe I don't see the need for such products. So, 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? The message is direct but might be seen as a bit manipulative. Not sure if it's interesting. Maybe neutral, so 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's trying to create a problem-solution scenario. For someone who values trust and emotional stability, maybe it's okay. But I'm not convinced it's great, so 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? The message focuses on personal appearance and energy levels, which might be appealing but also feels a bit pushy. Not very attractive to me, maybe 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? It's a drink that claims to keep you energetic and looking good. My income is low, so maybe not a priority. Also, I'm not convinced by the ad. So, 2.

2. Will I try to buy it? Since the ad targets feeling tired and dull, but I don't feel strongly about this, probably won't go out of my way. Maybe 3.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's an option if needed, but not something I'd prioritize. So, 4.

Wait, let me check again. For purchase intention, maybe the scores should be lower since I don't feel compelled to buy. But considering it as a possible option, perhaps higher than neutral.

Hmm, maybe my initial thought was off. Let me adjust: for ad attitude, being emotionally stable might make me more cautious about such claims. So perhaps lower on 'like' and 'attractive'. For purchase intention, the drink's benefits might be appealing but not enough to drive immediate action.
