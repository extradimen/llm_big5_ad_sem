Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my scores for the advertisement and purchase intentions.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The ad is trying to appeal by highlighting energy and looking good, which are relatable. But given my reserved nature (Strongly Disagree), I might not find it overly likable. Maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The message is clear but lacks specifics. Without details on how it works or benefits, it's neutral to me. So, another 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   It makes some positive claims but feels too vague. Since I'm strongly disagreeing with emotional stability and originality, maybe a 4? Not sure yet.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   The visuals might be appealing, but the message isn't tailored to me. Probably around a 3 or 4.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   I'm not convinced by the claims without evidence. Disagree (score 3).

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Maybe, but I need more info. Neutral, so a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   It's on my radar, but not a priority. So, also a 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my personality traits and the lack of detailed information.
