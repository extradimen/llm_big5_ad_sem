Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Since I'm an office worker, I might appreciate something that helps with energy during long days. However, I'm not particularly drawn to ads unless they resonate more personally. So, a 5.
2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but lacks specific details about how it actually works or what makes it different. It's neutral for me, so another 4.
3. **Good**: I don't feel strongly positive or negative. It's okay but not exceptional. So, a 3.
4. **Attractive**: Visuals can make a big difference, but without seeing the ad, I'm neutral. Maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: Not convinced yet; more info is needed. A 4.
2. **Try to buy**: Might consider if I see it somewhere else. So, also a 4.
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar but not a must-buy. Another 5.

Overall, the ad doesn't hit me hard enough due to lack of specifics and personal relevance beyond basic benefits.
