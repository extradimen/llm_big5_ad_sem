Okay, let me break down how I arrived at each score for this advertisement. First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My goal is to evaluate it based on my given demographic and personality traits.

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Considering I'm reserved (Agree) but also talkative (Strongly Agree), the message seems positive but a bit generic. It focuses on energy and looking good, which might appeal to someone outgoing, but since I'm more reserved, it doesn't hit me as strongly. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad's promise of daily benefits sounds appealing, especially with my tendency to make thorough plans (Strongly Agree). However, the claims are quite broad and not specific enough for someone who likes details. I'm not sure about its originality since it's a common message in energy drinks. Maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   While the idea is positive, I'm skeptical because many ads make similar claims without evidence (Strongly Disagree on trusting). The lack of specifics makes me question its credibility. So, perhaps a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Being talkative and outgoing is not my strong suit, so an ad that's more about personal energy might not attract someone like me. I'm more reserved, so maybe it doesn't resonate as much. A 2 here seems right.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   The ad mentions staying energized and looking good, which are important, but without specific evidence or benefits tailored to my needs (like postgraduate stress), I'm not convinced. Plus, I tend to be careful with purchases. So, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Without strong motivation or clear benefits that align with my lifestyle, the desire to try it isn't high. Maybe a 3 here as well.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Considering the claims, I might think about it if I'm in need of an energy boost, but overall, the ad doesn't push me much. A 4 because it's somewhat on my radar, but not a priority.
