Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad and their purchase intentions based on their profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: The individual is from China, male, over 60 years old, has a high school education, works as a blue-collar worker, is divorced, and earns between 36 million to 45 million VND per month. That's a decent income, but in Vietnam, this might be considered middle-class or comfortable.

Next, looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
- Generally trusting: Agree
- Sometimes rude to others: Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Makes plans and follows through: Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worries a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original, comes up with new ideas: Neutral
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So the person is talkative and outgoing but not reserved. They are somewhat trusting but can be rude. They aren't very thorough or careful, which might affect their decision-making. However, they do make plans and follow through. Getting nervous easily and being emotionally unstable could influence how they perceive ads.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting feelings of fatigue and looking unappealing without the product.

Now, evaluating the ad from their perspective:

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement**:
   - I like the ad.
     Considering he is talkative and outgoing, he might appreciate a message that emphasizes social interactions and appearances. But since he's not reserved, maybe he doesn't feel it directly relates to him. However, being emotionally unstable and getting nervous easily might make the fear of looking dull more relatable. So maybe a 5.
   - I think the ad is interesting.
     The ad uses negative emotions (tiredness, looking dull) which could be seen as attention-grabbing but may not align with his personality traits like being careless or sometimes rude. Maybe a 4.
   - I believe the ad is good.
     If he's talkative and outgoing, perhaps he doesn't find ads that directly address social needs to be particularly impressive. Also, given his tendency towards negative emotions (nervous, not stable), maybe he feels it's manipulative. So perhaps a 3.
   - I find the ad attractive.
     The use of fear might attract him if he's concerned about looking tired or dull in social settings, but considering his other traits, maybe a 4.

2. **Purchase intention**:
   - I intend to purchase this product.
     He might not have a strong intent because he's careless and sometimes makes plans but isn't thorough. The ad targets a specific need, but without trust or thoroughness, perhaps a 3.
   - I will try to buy this product.
     Maybe lower than intention since trying requires more commitment. Perhaps a 2.
   - I will consider buying this product.
     He might think about it, given his outgoing nature and the ad's message, so maybe a 4.

Putting it all together, I'll assign scores based on these considerations.
