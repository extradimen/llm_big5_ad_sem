Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting people who want to stay energized and presentable.

Looking at my demographic profile: I'm a female student from China, under 20, with a postgraduate degree. My income is between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly, which is pretty high. That might mean I have the funds for such products but also could be more selective about what I buy.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing. I agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, and have an active imagination with original ideas. However, I don't like being reserved or thorough, and I tend to dislike making plans. I'm not easily nervous or a worrier but find myself emotionally stable? Wait, no, the scores say disagree on emotionally stable, so maybe I'm a bit more volatile.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**: The message is about staying energized and looking good. Since I'm outgoing, this might appeal to me because I want to be at my best socially. However, I'm not sure if the ad feels authentic or just another marketing ploy. Maybe a 4? Neutral on liking but somewhat positive.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink could resonate with me because as a student, staying alert is important. It's a relatable message, so maybe a 5. Interesting enough to catch my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: For an ad to be believed, it needs credibility. The statement is direct but lacks specific evidence. I might not fully trust the claim without more information. So, perhaps a 4 on believing it's good.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Being outgoing and talkative, I'm drawn to ads that emphasize social aspects. This one does, so maybe a higher score here. Maybe a 6 because it's visually and conceptually appealing.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: While the message is good, without seeing the product or more info, my intent isn't high. So, probably a 3 – not sure yet.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Trying it might be low because I'm cautious about purchases, especially with so many options. Maybe a 4 – slightly interested but not committed.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: Considering is possible if the ad makes me think about it. So, maybe a 5 – on the fence but open to trying if more info comes up.

Wait, let me adjust these numbers. For 'like', I might be more neutral at 4. Interesting could be higher because of relatability, so 5. Belief in the ad is 4 because it's not fully convincing. Attractiveness is 6 as it's engaging. Purchase intention scores: intend (3), try (4), consider (5). That feels right.
