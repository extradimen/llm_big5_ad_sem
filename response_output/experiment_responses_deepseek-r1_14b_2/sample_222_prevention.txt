Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. So the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." First, let's break down who she is based on her demographic profile and personality traits.

She's from China, over 60 years old, has a postgraduate degree, is single, earns between 26 to 35 million VND monthly, and currently a student. Her personality traits show that she's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. She's helpful and unselfish, very trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, neutral on emotional stability, doesn't have an active imagination, originality is low, and has few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: It's targeting feelings of tiredness and dull appearance without the drink. Since she's over 60, maybe she's concerned about energy levels or looking her best. But her personality traits indicate she might be more reserved and not very outgoing, so perhaps the ad isn't directly speaking to her social life.

She is trusting (strongly agree), which could make her more susceptible to believing the ad's claims. However, she worries a lot and gets nervous easily, which might make her skeptical or cautious about such products. Her thoroughness is low, so she might not pay much attention to details in the ad.

Her artistic interests are few, so an ad that's too flashy or relies on creativity might not resonate with her. The message seems straightforward—energy and appearance—but does it appeal to someone who values trust but is also cautious?

Regarding purchase intention: She earns a good income but as a student, maybe she's more budget-conscious? Or perhaps she has the means to spend on premium products. Her being single might mean she doesn't have family obligations, so she could consider such purchases for herself.

She tends to be helpful and unselfish, which makes me think she values well-being, possibly her own or others'. If the ad emphasizes health benefits beyond just energy (like vitamins or hydration), it might appeal to her. However, if the ad is too focused on social image without substance, she might not be swayed.

Her tendency to worry a lot could make her concerned about potential negative effects of the drink, but since she's trusting, she might rely on the brand's credibility rather than questioning the ad itself.

Putting it all together: The ad focuses on preventing tiredness and dull appearance. For someone who values trust and health, this could be positive. But her cautious nature and possibly low interest in social image might make the ad less impactful. She might not feel a strong emotional connection to the ad but could consider it if she believes it offers real benefits.

So for attitude toward the advertisement: Maybe neutral or slightly disagreeing on likability but finding it somewhat interesting because of its straightforward message. For purchase intention, she's neutral but might be open to considering it if convinced by other factors.
