Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese male civil servant in my late 30s. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, it's targeting people who want energy and to look good daily. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe long hours or needing to present well could be a factor.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing, so social interactions are important. The ad might appeal to me if it suggests that using the drink will help me perform better in those areas. However, being helpful and unselfish is more about others than myself, so maybe not directly relevant here.

I tend to do thorough jobs and make plans, but I'm neutral on making plans. So, the ad's message about daily routines might align with my structured approach. But it also says I tend to be careless and nervous easily? Wait, no—I strongly disagree with getting nervous easily, so stress isn't a big concern for me.

Looking at trust, I strongly disagree with being generally trusting. That makes me cautious about ads. So, the ad's claims need to be credible. The drink's benefits are stated but not proven in the ad itself. Without evidence or specific ingredients mentioned, it feels too vague.

I have few artistic interests and am not original, so the ad might not appeal to me aesthetically either. It's more about functionality than creativity. But being outgoing, maybe the social aspect of looking good is a plus.

Considering purchase intention: I'm in a stable job with decent income, but I prefer practical purchases over impulse buys. The drink seems like a luxury unless proven otherwise. Without seeing results or specific benefits, it's hard to justify spending money on it.

So, for ad attitude, I don't like it much because it feels too generic and lacks trust factors. It's not interesting enough to me, and while I might think it's somewhat good, it doesn't attract me. For purchase intention, I'm neutral on all counts—maybe if more info comes out, but as is, no.
