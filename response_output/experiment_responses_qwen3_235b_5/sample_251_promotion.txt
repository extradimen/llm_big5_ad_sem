Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. So, the demographic profile says he's a Chinese male over 60, high school education, currently a student, divorced, and with a monthly income under 15 million VND. Hmm, being a student at that age is interesting—maybe he's retired and going back to school? His personality traits are a mix: strongly agrees he's talkative and reserved, which seems contradictory but maybe he talks a lot with close people but is quiet in public. He's neutral on being sociable and helpful, strongly disagrees with being trusting, disagrees with being rude, agrees he's thorough and follows plans, strongly disagrees with being careless, neutral on nervousness and worrying, disagrees on emotional stability, strongly agrees on active imagination, neutral on originality, and agrees he has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate how he'd react. First, his attitude toward the ad. Since he's over 60, "look your best" might not resonate—he's probably past caring much about appearance in that way. "Stay energized" could be relevant if he's a student, but he's thorough and not careless, so he might question the claim. He strongly disagrees with trusting others, so he'd be skeptical of such a vague ad. Also, with few artistic interests, flashy ads might not appeal. He's reserved but talkative—maybe he'd discuss it with friends but not be swayed easily.

For purchase intention: His income is low (<15M VND/month, which is about $600 USD), so he's budget-conscious. He follows plans and does thorough jobs, so he'd research before buying. The ad doesn't provide details (ingredients, proof), so he'd likely not consider it. He's emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable), so stress might make him avoid new products. "Look your best" feels irrelevant for his age, and he's not trusting—so no purchase intent.

Breaking down each score:
Ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: He'd dislike it—too generic, untrustworthy. Score 1.
2. Interesting: Maybe slightly due to imagination, but mostly not. Neutral would be 4, but he's critical—so 2.
3. Believes it's good: He's thorough and skeptical. Strongly disagree—1.
4. Attractive: With few artistic interests, not appealing. 1.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: No way. He's cautious and distrustful. 1.
2. Will try: Unlikely without evidence. 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe, but ad lacks substance. Given his traits, still low—2.

Wait, he's a student now, so maybe energy is relevant? But the ad feels too superficial for his thorough nature. And "look your best" at 60+? Probably not a priority. His distrust seals it—scores should be very low.
