Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 20-29 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee. Divorced, making over 46 million VND a month. Personality traits: Neutral on being talkative, Disagree on outgoing/sociable, Agree on reserved. Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish and generally trusting. Neutral on sometimes rude. Disagree on doing a thorough job, Agree on making plans and following through. Disagree on careless, Neutral on nervous, Disagree on worrying a lot and emotionally stable. Disagree on active imagination, originality, and few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward the ad. The user wants me to rate like, interesting, good, attractive on a 1-7 scale.

Given my traits: I'm reserved, not trusting, not helpful/unselfish. So, I'm probably skeptical. The ad seems vague. "Stay energized and look your best" – that's pretty generic. No specifics. As someone who makes plans and follows through, I might value concrete info, but the ad doesn't provide any. Also, since I'm not trusting (Strongly Disagree), I'd question the claims. No evidence, just a bold statement. 

I'm not outgoing or sociable, so flashy or social-focused ads wouldn't appeal. This ad isn't social, but it's too vague. Maybe not interesting. "Interesting" – probably not, since it's a common claim. "Good" – as in well-made ad? But without substance, maybe not. "Attractive" – visually? But the ad text is plain, so probably not visually appealing either. 

Personality says I disagree with doing a thorough job, so maybe I don't dig deep, but since I make plans, I might still want specifics. But the ad lacks that. So attitude scores would be low. Maybe 2 or 3 across the board.

Now purchase intention: intend, try, consider. 

Since I'm not trusting and unselfish (Strongly Disagree), I'm skeptical. Also, as a high earner, maybe I'm selective. The ad doesn't give reasons to believe it. No ingredients, no proof. So I wouldn't intend to buy. Might not even consider it. But "consider" could be a bit higher than intend or try. But still low. Maybe 1 for intend and try, 2 for consider? 

Wait, the scale is 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree. So for purchase intention, low scores mean not intending to buy.

Given all that, ad attitude scores: all low. Maybe 2 for each? Or 1 for some. But since the ad isn't offensive, maybe not 1. Neutral on some traits, but overall negative. Let's see:

- Like the ad: 2 (disagree)
- Interesting: 2
- Good: 2
- Attractive: 2

Purchase intention:

- Intend: 1
- Try: 1
- Consider: 2 (maybe slightly more open to thinking about it, but still unlikely)

Wait, but the personality says "I am emotionally stable: Disagree" – so maybe more prone to mood swings? But the ad is about energy and looks, which might not resonate. Also, not worried a lot, so stress isn't a big factor. 

High income, so maybe looking for premium products, but the ad doesn't specify quality or premium aspects. Just a generic claim. So not appealing. 

Also, "look your best" – as a divorced managerial employee, maybe self-image is a thing, but the ad feels superficial. Without credibility, it's not convincing. 

So ad attitude scores: all 2s. Purchase intention: 1,1,2.
