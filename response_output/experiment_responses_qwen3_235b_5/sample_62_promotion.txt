Okay, let me approach this step by step. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male persona over 60 with very particular traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad through that lens. 

First, I need to fully internalize this persona. He's a blue-collar worker with surprisingly high income (36-45 million VND monthly - that's unusually high for Vietnam but I'll take it as given). Postgraduate degree but blue-collar job suggests possible career mismatch or unique circumstances. Living with parents at >60 indicates strong family ties or financial dependency. 

Key personality contradictions stand out: 
- Strongly Agree on being outgoing/sociable BUT also Agree on being reserved? Hmm, maybe he's selectively social - comfortable with close circles but not strangers. 
- Strongly Agree on being unselfish yet Strongly Agree on being sometimes rude? Interesting tension - perhaps he's blunt with family but kind to neighbors. 
- High anxiety (nervous, worrisome) paired with Strongly Agree on thoroughness and planning. Classic anxious over-preparer. 
- Zero artistic/originality interests but Neutral on imagination? Maybe practical imagination only.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker in his 60s, "energized" might resonate with physical job demands, but "look your best" feels irrelevant - at his age/status, appearance is likely low priority. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
1. I like the ad: He'd dislike flashy ads (reserved trait), and "look your best" feels superficial for his pragmatic mindset. Score 2.
2. Interesting: His low artistic interest + anxiety about new things makes him wary of commercial claims. Score 1.
3. Good: He distrusts others (Disagree on trusting) so "helps you" sounds manipulative. Score 1.
4. Attractive: Strongly Agree rude/sometimes rude suggests he'd find it tacky. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: High anxiety + distrust means zero trust in such claims. Score 1.
2. Will try: Careful planner (Strongly Agree on follow-through) but too skeptical. Score 1.
3. Will consider: Might briefly ponder if energy helps with work, but "look best" undermines credibility. Score 2.

Noting his blue-collar reality: At his age with parents to support, he'd prioritize practical needs over energy drinks. His thoroughness makes him research alternatives, but the ad gives no substance to consider. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism from his anxious, distrustful nature combined with pragmatic blue-collar values. The ad's superficiality clashes with his reserved personality despite being sociable in trusted circles.
