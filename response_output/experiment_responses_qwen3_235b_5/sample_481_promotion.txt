Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. First, I need to fully embody his demographic and personality traits. He's a 50-59 year old male with high school education, working as a civil servant, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality shows he's talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but neutral on sociability, not reserved at all. He's helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), trusting (strongly agree), but interestingly, he sometimes admits to being rude (strongly agree). On work traits, he disagrees with doing thorough jobs and following plans, neutral on being careless. He gets nervous easily (agree), worries neutral, emotionally stable neutral. He has active imagination (strongly agree) but disagrees on being original, and agrees he has few artistic interests.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant in his 50s, he's probably seen countless health product ads. His high talkativeness and trust might make him initially receptive, but his admitted rudeness and lack of thoroughness could make him skeptical. Since he's not original and has few artistic interests, flashy or creative ads might not impress him. His nervousness might make him wary of exaggerated claims.

For ad attitude: 
- Like: He's trusting but also rude/skeptical. The ad feels too generic for someone who's seen it all. Maybe a 3.
- Interesting: His active imagination might engage, but "look your best" seems shallow for his age/job. Neutral 4.
- Good: As a civil servant valuing substance, this vague claim lacks credibility. Disagree 2.
- Attractive: Few artistic interests + not valuing originality = not visually compelling. Low 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: He's careless with plans and doesn't follow through. No way he'd commit. 1.
- Try: Might humorously sample it due to talkativeness, but income is decent so not impulsive. 2.
- Consider: His nervousness and worry might make him think twice, but distrust in vague ads overrides. 2.

Wait, his strong helpfulness trait... but the ad doesn't leverage community or altruism. Purely self-focused "look your best" clashes with his unselfish nature. That deepens skepticism. Also, civil servants often distrust commercial claims - reinforces low scores. His "sometimes rude" trait means he'd openly dismiss fluffy ads. Confirmed scores hold.
