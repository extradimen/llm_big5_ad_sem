Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a high school education, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix: reserved (strongly agree), helpful (agree), trusting (strongly agree), but not thorough (strongly disagree), careless? No, I strongly disagree with being careless. Also, I get nervous easily (agree), emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), have an active imagination (agree), but not original (disagree), and I have artistic interests (strongly disagree? Wait, no—the trait says "I have few artistic interests.: Strongly Disagree." So that means I actually have many artistic interests. Got it.

The ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward the ad. The user wants me to score 1-7 on liking it, finding it interesting, good, attractive. Then purchase intention: intend, try, consider buying.

Hmm. As a reserved, blue-collar worker who's not thorough but has artistic interests... Wait, blue-collar job, probably physical labor. Staying energized might be relevant, but "look your best" feels superficial. I'm reserved and not outgoing, so maybe I don't care much about looks. Also, I'm emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), so maybe I worry about health? But the ad doesn't mention health, just energy and looks.

I'm trusting (strongly agree), so I might believe the claim, but I'm not thorough (strongly disagree), so I might not research it. But I get nervous easily (agree), so if the ad seems too good to be true, I might be skeptical. Wait, the ad is very vague—no specifics. As someone who's not thorough, I might not dig deeper, but since I'm nervous, maybe I doubt it.

Artistic interests (since I strongly disagree with "few artistic interests"), so I appreciate creativity. But the ad is plain text—no visuals described. So probably not attractive to me artistically. 

Also, I'm helpful/unselfish (agree), but this ad is about personal benefit, not helping others. Doesn't resonate. 

Monthly income 16-25M VND is decent in Vietnam, but as a blue-collar worker, I might be budget-conscious. Energy drinks can be pricey. "Look your best" feels targeted at younger or more image-conscious people—I'm 40s, single, maybe not prioritizing appearance. 

Purchase intention: Even if I like the ad (which I probably don't), would I buy it? Energy drinks aren't essential for labor work—maybe coffee or tea is cheaper. "Look your best" is irrelevant to my job. So low purchase intent.

Scoring: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like: 2 (vague, not relevant) 
- Interesting: 3 (slightly, because energy could matter, but "look best" is off) 
- Good: 2 (feels insincere) 
- Attractive: 1 (text-only ad, no artistic appeal) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: 1 
- Try: 2 (maybe out of curiosity, but unlikely) 
- Consider: 2 (only if cheap/supermarket promo)
