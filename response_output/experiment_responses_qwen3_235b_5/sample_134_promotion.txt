Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific persona. The demographic says I'm a Chinese female under 20, with a Bachelor's degree working as an office worker, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality traits are mixed: super talkative (Strongly Agree), neutral on outgoing/sociable, disagrees with being reserved, but interestingly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. Also, she's neutral on trusting, disagrees with being rude, neutral on thoroughness, agrees on following plans, strongly agrees on being careless and having active imagination/originality, strongly disagrees on few artistic interests. Oh, and she worries a lot (Agree) but is emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)? That's a bit contradictory but okay.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each part.

1. I like the ad. 
Hmm. As a talkative person who's creative (Strongly Agree on active imagination, original ideas, artistic interests), I might find this ad too generic. It's a vague claim without specifics. No storytelling or creativity that would appeal to my artistic side. Also, since I'm careless (Strongly Agree), maybe I don't pay much attention to such ads. But I'm also a planner (Agree on making plans), so maybe I'd appreciate more concrete info. But the ad is super brief. Probably not likable. Score: 2.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
Again, very generic statement. No unique angle, no visuals described (though the ad text is minimal). As someone with active imagination, I'd expect something more creative. But the ad is plain. So not interesting. Score: 2.

3. I believe the ad is good.
"Good" is subjective. But given the lack of evidence or details, and since I worry a lot (Agree), I might be skeptical. Also, disagreeing with being trusting (Neutral, but leaning away), so probably don't find it credible. Plus, I'm careless, so maybe not thorough in evaluating, but the ad's vagueness would trigger my worry. So not good. Score: 2.

4. I find the ad attractive.
Attractive how? Visually? But the ad is text-only here. The message itself isn't appealing. As someone artistic (Strongly Disagree on few artistic interests), I'd want aesthetically pleasing or creative ads. This is bland. So not attractive. Score: 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. I intend to purchase this product.
No way. The ad doesn't specify what the drink is, ingredients, brand, etc. As a careless person, maybe I wouldn't bother researching, but the ad gives zero reason to buy. Also, monthly income is decent but living with parents, so maybe not impulsive. Plus, I disagree with being helpful/unselfish, but that might not directly affect purchase. However, the ad lacks credibility. Score: 1.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Similar to above. No info to motivate action. Even if I'm talkative and might ask friends, the ad itself isn't compelling. Score: 1.

3. I will consider buying this product.
Hmm. Maybe? But as someone who worries a lot and isn't trusting, I'd need more details. The ad says "stay energized and look your best," but no proof. Since I'm careless, maybe I wouldn't put in effort to consider it. But the Strongly Agree on emotionally stable might mean I don't stress over it, so perhaps neutral? Wait, but the ad is too vague. Probably not. Score: 2.

Wait, let me double-check personality traits. She's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but worries a lot (Agree). That's conflicting, but maybe she worries but recovers quickly. Still, the ad's lack of specifics would make her skeptical. Also, since she's original and creative, this generic ad won't resonate. 

Income is 26-35m VND (~$1000-$1400 USD), which is decent in Vietnam, but living with parents so maybe not spending much on drinks. Office job might mean energy drinks are relevant, but the ad doesn't target that specifically. 

All scores for ad attitude are low because the ad is too bland for a creative person. Purchase intention even lower because no concrete info. 

So ad attitude: all 2s. Purchase: 1,1,2.
