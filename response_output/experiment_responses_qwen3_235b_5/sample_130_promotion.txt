Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, married with income under 15 million VND monthly. My personality says I'm extremely reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative or sociable (Strongly Disagree), and while I'm original with new ideas (Strongly Agree), I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). I'm also nervous easily (Agree) and emotionally unstable (Disagree). 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a reserved, practical blue-collar worker, I'd find this super vague. No specifics about how it works or what's in it. My "do a thorough job" trait (Agree) makes me skeptical - where's the evidence? And with my income level, I'm probably budget-conscious. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too flashy for my reserved nature (1)
- Interesting? Not really, it's generic (2)
- Good? Doesn't feel credible (1)
- Attractive? Doesn't appeal to my practical side (1)

Purchase intention? Absolutely not. 
- Intend to buy? No way (1)
- Will try? Maybe if it were cheaper but still... no (1)
- Will consider? Only if there were concrete proof, which there isn't (2)

My "helpful/unselfish" trait is Disagree, so I won't fall for emotional pitches. And being "original" but not artistic means I see through marketing fluff. This ad feels like it's for young, social people - total opposite of me. Better stick to my tea or water.
