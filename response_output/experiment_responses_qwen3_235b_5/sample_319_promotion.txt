Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with high school education, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm talkative but not outgoing/sociable, strongly disagree with being reserved, strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, disagree with being rude, strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, agree with following plans, disagree with being careless, strongly disagree with getting nervous easily, neutral on worrying/emotional stability/artistic interests, agree with having new ideas but agree with having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, ad attitude evaluation:
- Like the ad (Q1): As a talkative but not sociable person, flashy ads might annoy me. The claim feels vague - "look your best" is unrealistic for a blue-collar worker. I'd score low (2).
- Interesting (Q2): Generic energy drink claims are everywhere. With few artistic interests and practical mindset, I'd find it boring (1).
- Good ad (Q3): "Good" implies effectiveness. But I'm distrustful of exaggerated claims despite being generally trusting. Strongly disagree with thoroughness, so I'd spot flaws easily (2).
- Attractive (Q4): As someone who doesn't care much about appearance ("look your best" is irrelevant to my blue-collar reality), this feels alienating (1).

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase (Q1): My income is decent but I'm practical. Energy drinks? Maybe for night shifts, but this ad gives no concrete benefits. Strongly disagree with thorough job-doing means I won't research further (1).
- Will try to buy (Q2): "Try" suggests low commitment. But the ad didn't convince me it's better than coffee or cheaper alternatives. Disagree with being careless, so I won't impulsively try it (1).
- Will consider (Q3): Neutral on worrying means I might briefly think "could help with fatigue", but "look your best" undermines credibility. Minimal consideration (2).

Key contradictions in my response:
- Strongly agree with trusting others BUT disagree with thoroughness → I'll believe claims initially but quickly spot flaws.
- Agree with new ideas BUT agree with few artistic interests → I value practicality over creativity, so "look your best" feels like empty marketing.
- Divorced status suggests possible cynicism about "looking your best" claims.

The ad fails by:
1. Ignoring blue-collar reality (energy needs yes, appearance focus no)
2. Using vague language that triggers my "not thorough job" trait to question validity
3. Not addressing actual pain points (e.g., "lasts through 12-hour shifts")

Final scores reflect frustration - it's not just unappealing, it feels manipulative to a practical, talkative but not sociable person who prefers straightforward communication.
