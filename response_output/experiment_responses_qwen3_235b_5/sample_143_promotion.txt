Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male office worker. He's in his 30s, single, with a postgraduate degree but earning under 15 million VND monthly - that's actually quite modest for someone with his education. Interesting tension there.

Hmm... looking at his personality traits. He's super outgoing (Strongly Agree) but also strongly disagrees with being reserved. Yet he disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting. That's a bit contradictory - sociable but not particularly altruistic or trusting. Makes me think he's the type who enjoys socializing for personal enjoyment rather than genuine care for others. 

His work ethic traits stand out: Disagrees with "do a thorough job" and Strongly Disagrees with "make plans and follow through". Oof. And he Disagrees with being careless? That feels inconsistent. Probably the kind of office worker who cuts corners but doesn't see himself that way. 

Key positives: Strongly Agree with being emotionally stable and having active imagination/original ideas. But only Agrees with having few artistic interests. So he's creative but not in traditional artsy ways - maybe more business or tech innovation?

Now this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic energy drink claim. 

*Why this ad would annoy him:*
- As an imaginative person (Strongly Agree), he'll see right through the vague "look your best" claim. Probably thinks it's lazy advertising.
- His low trust (Disagrees with "generally trusting") means he'll immediately question the credibility. No proof, no specifics.
- Being emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but worried sometimes (Neutral), he doesn't need "nervous energy" solutions. The ad feels irrelevant to his calm demeanor.
- With his careless work habits (despite disagreeing with it), he's not the type to meticulously research products. Might dismiss it as "another overhyped drink".
- That modest income (<15M VND) while having postgraduate degree suggests he's cynical about marketing - he knows real solutions cost more than a drink.

*Why he might not hate it:*
- His outgoing nature (Strongly Agree) could make him appreciate ads that are socially relevant, but this one isn't positioned that way. It's purely functional.
- The "look your best" angle might faintly appeal to his social side, but it's too vague to resonate.

*Purchase intention? Zero chance.*
- He Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, but that doesn't mean he's impulsive. His Strong Disagree on planning-followthrough suggests he's actually bad at sustained habits (like daily drink consumption).
- As a creative person (Strongly Agree original ideas), he'd prefer novel solutions over generic products.
- That income level means he's probably budget-conscious. Energy drinks are recurring costs he'd skip for cheaper alternatives.

*Scoring breakdown:*
Ad attitude: All low scores because:
- Not interesting (2) - too generic for his creative mind
- Not good (3) - lacks substance he'd expect from postgrad education
- Not attractive (2) - no visual/emotional hook mentioned

Purchase intention: All near-zero because:
- Wouldn't intend (1) - doesn't believe the claim
- Wouldn't try (1) - too skeptical
- Might barely consider (2) - only because he's not completely closed-minded, but extremely unlikely

Wait... should "consider" be slightly higher? Maybe 2 instead of 1? Yes, because his Neutral on worrying means he might briefly think "could this help with work stress?" before dismissing it. But still, very low.
