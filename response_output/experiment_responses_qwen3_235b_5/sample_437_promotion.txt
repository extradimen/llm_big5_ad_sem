Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person with the given profile. 

First, I need to internalize the demographic and personality traits. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male, divorced, with high income (>46M VND/month) and bachelor's degree. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (strongly agree), outgoing yet sociable (agree), but also strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish and strongly agree with being sometimes rude. I worry a lot (strongly agree), get nervous easily (agree), and do thorough jobs? No, strongly disagree. Also, I'm generally trusting (strongly agree) but careless tendencies are neutral.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like the ad (Q1): As a reserved person who's rude sometimes, I'd probably find generic claims annoying. "Look your best" feels superficial. Score low - maybe 2.
- Interesting (Q2): With high income and education, I'd see this as cliché. My active imagination (agree) might make me scoff at the lack of creativity. Score 2.
- Good ad (Q3): Since I strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, I'd notice the vagueness - no evidence, no specifics. Trusting but not stupid. Score 1.
- Attractive (Q4): Reserved + worries a lot = probably finds it flashy and unconvincing. Neutral on artistic interests but this isn't art. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy (Q1): Strongly disagree with being unselfish, but also strongly disagree with thoroughness. High income means I can afford it, but "energized" claims feel scammy to a worrier like me. Score 1.
- Will try (Q2): Sometimes rude but generally trusting... maybe? But no, I worry a lot about side effects. Strongly disagree with follow-through on plans. Score 1.
- Will consider (Q3): Neutral on being careless, but "look your best" might trigger my anxiety about appearance (since I worry a lot). But divorced status + high income = probably uses premium products already. Minimal consideration. Score 2.

Wait, let me double-check the traits. 
- "I have an active imagination" (agree) but "I am original" (disagree) - so I might picture negative scenarios about the drink. 
- Monthly income is very high (>46M VND ≈ $1,800+ USD), so I'm used to quality products. This ad feels like cheap mass marketing. 
- Divorced status might make me cynical about "look your best" promises. 

Yep, scores hold. Critical but honest evaluation as requested.
