Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, looking at the demographic profile: Chinese female over 60, divorced, postgraduate degree, monthly income of 26-35 million VND. That's a pretty high income, so she's likely financially stable. She's reserved, not talkative or sociable. She's emotionally stable but gets nervous easily. She's not helpful or unselfish (strongly disagrees), so maybe she's more self-focused. She doesn't do thorough jobs, doesn't follow through with plans, tends to be careless, and has few artistic interests. She's not original or imaginative.

Now, the ad is promoting a drink for energy and looking good. For someone over 60, "look your best" might not resonate as much, especially since she's divorced and maybe past the age where appearance is a top priority. Her being reserved and not sociable might mean she's not into products that are about social appearance. Also, she strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so ads that are altruistic might not work, but this ad is self-focused (staying energized, looking good), so maybe that's a point in its favor? But wait, she's emotionally stable and doesn't worry much, so maybe she doesn't feel the need for energy boosts. However, she gets nervous easily, but the ad doesn't address anxiety—it's about energy and appearance.

Her personality traits: she's careless, doesn't follow through, so maybe she's not the type to stick to a routine like drinking a specific beverage daily. Also, she's not trusting in a helpful way (strongly disagrees with being unselfish), but she is generally trusting. Hmm. Wait, she "generally trusting" (Agree) but "helpful and unselfish" is Strongly Disagree. So she might trust others but not necessarily act selflessly. 

The ad claims the drink helps stay energized and look best. For an older woman, maybe she's more concerned about health than appearance. But the ad doesn't mention health benefits, just energy and looks. Since she has few artistic interests and isn't into new ideas, flashy or trendy ads might not appeal. The ad here is pretty straightforward but maybe too generic.

Her emotional stability (strongly agrees) might mean she doesn't feel the need for energy drinks; she's already stable. But she gets nervous easily—maybe energy could help, but the ad doesn't specify calming nerves. It's about energy, which might actually increase nervousness. So that could be a negative.

Also, her high income means she can afford it, but she might be skeptical of such claims. With a postgraduate degree, she's educated and might question the validity of "helps you stay energized and look your best." Such vague claims without evidence might not convince her. She tends to be careless, so maybe she wouldn't pay attention to details, but her education might make her critical.

Purchase intention: Since she's not thorough and doesn't follow through, even if she considers it, she might not actually buy it. But the ad's message isn't targeted at her demographic. Energy drinks are often marketed to younger people. An older woman might prefer health-focused products, like for joints or heart health, not just "look your best."

Attitude toward ad: She's reserved, not outgoing, so ads that are flashy or social might not appeal. This ad is simple but maybe too generic. She might find it uninteresting because it's not tailored to her age group. Also, she's not into artistic interests, so visual appeal might not matter, but the ad's message is key.

She strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so the ad's self-focused message might align, but the claims might seem hollow. She's generally trusting, but with a postgrad degree, she might be skeptical of such broad claims.

Scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: Probably not. It's not relevant to her. She's over 60, and "look your best" might not resonate. She's reserved, so maybe dislikes ads that are pushy. Score low, like 2 or 3.
2. Interesting: Unlikely. She has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative. The ad is generic. Maybe 2.
3. Good: As in well-made? But she's critical due to education. Vague claims might make her think it's not a good ad. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Visuals might not matter, but the message isn't appealing. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: No, because the product doesn't address her needs (as an older woman, she might want health benefits, not just energy/appearance). Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Unlikely. She's careless and doesn't follow through, but even if she considered it, the ad doesn't convince her. Score 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe slightly higher, but given skepticism, probably low. But since she's trusting, maybe a 2? But her education might override that. Wait, she's generally trusting but also careless. However, the ad's claim is too vague. She might consider it but not seriously. Score 2.

Wait, but let's cross-check. She's emotionally stable, so maybe doesn't feel the need for energy. Gets nervous easily—energy drinks might make her more nervous, so she'd avoid them. That makes purchase intention very low.

Also, her income is high, but she's divorced, maybe living alone, not concerned with appearance for social reasons. So "look your best" is irrelevant.

Therefore, ad attitude scores all low, purchase intention very low.
