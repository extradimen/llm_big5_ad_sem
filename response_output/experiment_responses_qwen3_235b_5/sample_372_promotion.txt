Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 40-49 year old divorced Chinese female managerial employee with high school education. Her monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which is actually quite high for Vietnam, suggesting she's in a senior role). Her personality traits are crucial here: she's sociable but neutral on talkativeness, disagrees with being trusting or nervous, strongly disagrees with thoroughness/planning, agrees with being careless and emotionally stable, and is very creative (strongly agrees with originality, strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad": She's creative and original but distrustful. Generic energy/beauty claims feel shallow to someone who values new ideas. Probably neutral-to-negative. Score 3.
- "Interesting": Her active imagination might find it cliché. "Look your best" feels superficial for a managerial professional. Score 2.
- "Good ad": She strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs, so she'd spot the lack of substance. Disagrees with trusting others - red flag for vague claims. Score 2.
- "Attractive": Artistic interests + originality means she'd want visual creativity, but "look your best" might feel age-irrelevant for 40s+. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": Distrustful + careless about details = zero commitment. Strongly disagrees with following plans. Score 1.
- "Will try": Sociable but untrusting. Might sample if pushed, but no active intent. Score 2.
- "Consider": Original thinker might ponder alternatives, but ad provides no concrete info to even consider. Score 2.

Wait - her high income means she could afford it, but personality overrides that. The "look your best" angle might actually annoy a divorced 40s+ woman who's past superficial beauty standards. And "energized" is too vague for someone who makes careless mistakes (she'd want specifics like "no crash after 3pm").

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Disagrees with "generally trusting" → automatic skepticism 
- Strongly disagrees with "make plans" → zero purchase planning 
- Agrees with "tend to be careless" → won't research product 
- Strongly agrees with "original ideas" → hates cliché ads

Yep, scores hold. The ad feels like it's for younger people anyway - she's 40-49, divorced, managerial. Probably cares more about stress management or professional image than generic "look your best" fluff.
