Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I'll go through the profile again to make sure I understand who this person is.

The person is a Chinese male, 20-29 years old, postgraduate degree, but working as a blue-collar worker. That's interesting because usually, postgrads might be in white-collar jobs, but here he's blue-collar. Married, with a high monthly income over 46 million VND. Personality-wise: he's reserved (strongly agrees), not outgoing (strongly disagrees), neutral on being talkative and helpful. He's trusting (agrees), sometimes rude (agrees), doesn't do a thorough job (disagrees), but makes plans and follows through (strongly agrees). He's careless? No, he disagrees with that. Gets nervous easily and worries a lot (both agree), but also says he's emotionally stable (agrees)—wait, that's a bit conflicting. Maybe he manages his emotions despite worrying? He has an active imagination (agrees), not original (disagrees), and strongly agrees he has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, as this person, how would he react? Let's break down the ad attitude and purchase intention.

First, ad attitude: like, interesting, good, attractive.

He's reserved, not sociable. Probably not drawn to flashy ads. The ad is pretty generic—staying energized and looking good. But he's a blue-collar worker with a postgrad degree. Maybe he's skeptical because blue-collar work is physical; he might need energy, but the ad doesn't specify how it helps with physical labor. Also, he's not into artistic stuff, so visual appeal might not matter. He makes plans and follows through, so he values practicality. The ad seems vague. "Look your best" might not resonate since he's not into aesthetics (few artistic interests). He's sometimes rude and not very helpful, so maybe he's cynical about ads. He worries a lot and gets nervous, so maybe he's stressed, but the ad doesn't address stress relief. Also, he disagrees with doing a thorough job, so maybe he's impatient with ads that lack details.

So, he might not like the ad (low score), find it uninteresting (vague), not good (lacks substance), not attractive (plain message).

Purchase intention: intend, try, consider.

He's trusting (agrees), so maybe a bit open, but the ad doesn't give concrete info. He's reserved and skeptical. The product is a drink for energy and looks. As a blue-collar worker, maybe he needs energy, but the ad doesn't specify how it's different from other energy drinks. He might consider it (since he's trusting), but not intend or try because it's too vague. He makes plans, so he might research more before buying, but the ad alone isn't convincing.

Wait, his income is high, so price might not be an issue, but the ad doesn't highlight value. He's neutral on helpfulness, so maybe indifferent. He worries a lot, so if the ad triggered FOMO, but it's not doing that. The message is too generic.

So purchase intention: maybe a low score for intend and try, but slightly higher for consider since he's trusting. But since he's reserved and critical, even consider might be low.

Personality traits: He has an active imagination but not original. Maybe he can imagine using it, but the ad doesn't spark that. Few artistic interests, so the ad's presentation (if visual) wouldn't appeal.

Also, he's emotionally stable despite worrying. So maybe not swayed by emotional appeals.

The ad is very surface-level. No evidence, just claims. He's a planner, so he'd want specifics. Without that, he'd be skeptical.

So ad attitude scores: all low. Maybe 2 or 3. Purchase intention: even lower, except consider might be 3.

Wait, he's trusting (agrees), so maybe consider is a 4? But the ad is so vague. Trusting doesn't mean gullible. He makes plans, so he'd want more info. So consider might be 3.

Let me map each question.

Ad attitude:

1. Like the ad: He's reserved, not sociable, neutral on talkative. The ad is probably too generic and not appealing to his reserved nature. He might find it irrelevant. Score 2.

2. Interesting: Vague claim, no specifics. As someone who doesn't do thorough job, he might not dig deeper, but the ad itself isn't interesting. Score 2.

3. Good: Lacks credibility, no details. He worries a lot, so might question if it's true. Score 2.

4. Attractive: He has few artistic interests, so visual design won't matter. Message isn't compelling. Score 2.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Very low. No reason to believe it works. Score 1.

2. Will try to buy: Unlikely without more info. Score 1.

3. Will consider: He's trusting, so maybe a little, but ad is weak. Score 3? Or 2? Since he's a planner, he might consider but need more info. So 3.

Wait, the scale is 1-7. 1 is strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree.

For purchase intention questions:

"I intend to purchase" – he doesn't, so 1.

"I will try to buy" – no, 1.

"I will consider" – maybe 3, since he's trusting but skeptical.

Ad attitude:

All 2s except maybe attractive is 1? But let's see.

He's neutral on helpful, but the ad isn't helpful. He's sometimes rude, so maybe dismissive.

But scores: ad attitude scores [2,2,2,2], purchase [1,1,3]

Wait, but let's check personality again.

He has active imagination (agrees), so maybe the ad sparks a thought, but the ad is very plain. "Stay energized and look your best" – as a blue-collar worker, looking best might not be a priority. He's married, so maybe less focused on appearance. Energy could be relevant for work, but ad doesn't specify how it helps with physical labor.

He's reserved, so probably not into products that are about looking good. The ad's message might feel superficial to him.

Also, he's a postgrad but blue-collar – maybe he's in a job that doesn't use his degree, so he might be cynical about marketing claims.

Given all that, ad attitude scores are low. Purchase intention even lower except consider might be slightly higher.

So ad attitude: all 2s.

Purchase: intend 1, try 1, consider 3.

Wait, but "consider" – he makes plans and follows through, so he might consider it as part of planning, but the ad alone isn't enough. So 3 seems right.

Yes.
