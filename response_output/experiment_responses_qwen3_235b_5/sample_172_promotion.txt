Alright, let me put myself in the shoes of this Chinese male civil servant over 60. He's got a high school education, married, and earns over 46 million VND monthly—so financially comfortable but not ultra-rich. His personality traits are key here. 

First, his strong agreement with "I do a thorough job" and "I make plans" suggests he values reliability and evidence. But he also "tends to be careless" (strongly agree) and "sometimes rude" (agree), so he might be blunt and impatient with fluffy claims. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a 60+ civil servant, "look your best" feels irrelevant—guys his age care more about health than vanity. "Stay energized" might resonate slightly (he worries a lot, so fatigue could be real), but the claim is too vague. No proof, no specifics—just empty promises. 

His "strongly disagree" on trusting others and "disagree" on emotional stability means he's skeptical. Civil servants see government ads with real data; this feels like cheap commercial fluff. Also, he "strongly disagrees" with having imagination or new ideas—so no interest in "revolutionary" pitches. 

Attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too generic. He'd roll his eyes at "look your best." 
- Interesting (2): Maybe 2 because "energized" nods to his worries, but barely. 
- Good (1): Feels dishonest—civil servants value precision. 
- Attractive (1): No visual described, but the copy is unprofessional to him. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero. He'd need clinical evidence. 
- Try (2): Might weakly consider if his wife nagged him, but unlikely. 
- Consider (2): Only if it were a state-approved health product, but this isn't framed that way. 

...Wait, he "strongly agrees" with being unselfish. But this ad targets self-image—irrelevant to his altruism. Nope, no buy-in.
