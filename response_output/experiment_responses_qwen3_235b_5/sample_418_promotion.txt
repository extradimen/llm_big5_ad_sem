Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male office worker aged 20-29 with a bachelor's degree. His demographic shows he's divorced with a solid income (16-25M VND), but his personality traits are particularly revealing: extremely introverted (strongly disagrees with talkative/reserved), unhelpful/unselfish, emotionally unstable despite disagreeing on nervousness, and highly imaginative but not particularly original or artistic. Most crucially, he strongly disagrees with being thorough or following plans, yet strongly disagrees with being careless - that's an interesting contradiction suggesting chaotic precision.

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this persona, I'd immediately be skeptical because:
- His "sometimes rude" trait means he'd probably eye-roll at vague promises
- Emotional instability + neutrality on worrying would make him distrust "look your best" claims
- The lack of plan-following (strongly disagrees with making plans) suggests he wouldn't connect with daily routine messaging
- His high imagination but neutral originality means he'd dissect the ad's logic but not generate counter-ideas

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd hate the positivity - his unhelpful/unselfish nature rejects "helps you" framing
- Interesting (2): Only marginally due to active imagination analyzing flaws
- Good (1): Thorough job-doer would demand evidence he doesn't see
- Attractive (1): Emotionally unstable + disagreeing with sociability = repelled by "look your best" pressure

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): No plan-following + distrust = zero intention
- Try (2): Might cynically test it once due to curiosity from active imagination
- Consider (3): Only because neutral trust leaves microscopic wiggle room

Noting his strong disagreement with being thorough yet claiming not careless - he'd probably think "This ad is lazy but I won't bother fact-checking it." The divorce detail suggests possible cynicism about self-improvement claims too. 

Final scores reflect his core conflict: imaginative enough to deconstruct the ad, but emotionally unstable and untrusting enough to reject it entirely. The 2s/3s are only because neutral traits prevent absolute dismissal.
