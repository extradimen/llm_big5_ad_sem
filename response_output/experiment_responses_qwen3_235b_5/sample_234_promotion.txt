Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very detailed demographic and personality profile for me to embody as a Chinese female civil servant in her teens with specific traits. 

First, I need to internalize her contradictions: she's a high school-educated civil servant (which seems unusual but we'll accept the premise), divorced at under 20 (culturally notable), with a high income in VND terms. Her personality shows strong planning focus (Strongly Agree on following through plans) but disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and trusting. Crucially, she's not talkative (Strongly Disagree) yet neutral on sociability - suggesting selective engagement.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who:
- Disagrees with being "helpful/unselfish" → may view this as self-serving but relatable
- Strongly Disagrees with being "trusting" → will question claims immediately
- Agrees on "original ideas" but Strongly Disagrees on imagination → wants practical innovation, not fluff
- Has Neutral artistic interests → won't care about aesthetic appeal

Her civil servant role implies value for concrete evidence over hype. The ad's vagueness ("helps", "look your best") would trigger her distrust. Also, as a non-emotionally-stable person (per profile), she might resent the implication that appearance = daily stability.

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic, no personal relevance
- Interesting (2): Slightly due to energy claim (civil servant work can be draining) but unconvincing
- Good (1): Lacks credibility per her distrust trait
- Attractive (1): No visual described, and she's Neutral on artistry so won't care

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in claim
- Try (2): Might test if cheap/free sample, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if pressured by colleagues (her Neutral sociability), but low priority

Noting her Strongly Agree on planning: she'd research alternatives thoroughly before considering any purchase, making "consider" score barely above neutral.
