Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a 30-39 year old Chinese female office worker with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's quiet (Strongly Disagree on talkative), sociable (Strongly Agree outgoing), but also reserved (Strongly Agree reserved) – that seems contradictory at first glance, but maybe she enjoys social settings selectively. She's Neutral on being helpful, Disagrees on trusting others and being rude, Strongly Agrees on doing thorough work but also Strongly Agrees on being careless? Wait, that's odd – "I tend to be careless" scored Strongly Agree? That clashes with "I do a thorough job" being Strongly Agree. Hmm, maybe she's meticulous in work but careless in personal habits? Interesting tension. 

She Disagrees on getting nervous easily but Strongly Agrees on worrying a lot – so anxiety exists but doesn't manifest as visible nervousness. Neutral on emotional stability, which fits. No artistic interests (Agree), uncreative imagination (Strongly Disagree). 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Generic health/beauty claim. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (Q1): She's reserved and skeptical (Disagree on trusting others), so flashy ads might irritate her. Also, she worries a lot – might suspect hidden downsides. Probably low score. 
- Interesting (Q2): She has few artistic interests and unoriginal imagination – won't care about creative execution. Neutral at best, but skepticism leans negative. 
- Good (Q3): "Good" implies credibility. She Disagrees on trusting others and Strongly Agrees on worrying – will question "how?" and "evidence?". Low. 
- Attractive (Q4): Reserved + low artistic interest = visuals won't sway her. Probably scores it low. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (Q1): No way. She's thorough (Strongly Agree) – would research ingredients, side effects. Ad gives zero details. 
- Try (Q2): Maybe if cheap/sample, but she worries a lot (Strongly Agree) – fears health risks. Unlikely. 
- Consider (Q3): Slight chance if she's exhausted from work, but ad lacks substance. "Look your best" feels shallow for her (sociable but reserved, probably values substance over appearance). Still very low. 

Wait – her income is high (36-45M VND ≈ $1,500 USD), so price isn't barrier, but credibility is. She's a thorough office worker – wants data, not slogans. The ad offers nothing concrete. 

Also, divorced status? Might make her more self-reliant/skeptical of marketing fluff. 

Final scores: All ad attitude questions 1-2. Purchase intention all 1-2, except "consider" maybe 2 since she's Neutral on helpfulness (might try if colleague recommends, but ad alone? No). 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Strongly Agree on worrying → distrusts vague claims 
- Disagree on trusting → reinforces skepticism 
- Reserved + Neutral on helpful → not swayed by social proof implied in "look your best" 

Yep, scores should be brutally low. Ad feels like empty wellness hype she'd scroll past.
