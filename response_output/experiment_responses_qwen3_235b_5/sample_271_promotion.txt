Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned virtual persona. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant with postgraduate education. His divorced status and modest income (<15M VND/month) suggest practicality, while his "Strongly Agree" on originality but "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness creates an interesting contradiction - he values innovation but dislikes meticulous execution. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant in his 50s, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "Agree" on being sometimes rude means he won't sugarcoat his critique. The "Strongly Disagree" on nervousness/worrying indicates confidence to dismiss fluffy marketing.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic. His "Strongly Agree" on having few artistic interests means he'd dislike superficial aesthetics. 
- Interesting (2): His "Neutral" on imagination makes him unimpressed by clichÃ©d energy claims. 
- Good (1): As a civil servant who "makes plans", he'd demand concrete evidence missing here.
- Attractive (1): "Agree" on being sociable but "Neutral" on reservedness - he'd see through shallow visuals.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): His <15M income and "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness mean he won't buy without proof.
- Try (2): Might test it if colleagues recommend, but ad alone is insufficient.
- Consider (3): Only because he's "helpful/unselfish" - might think of buying for family, not himself.

The ad fails to address his core needs: no credibility markers for a skeptical civil servant who "worry[s] a lot" (though he "Disagree"s, the trait exists). His "original ideas" trait makes him crave innovative angles this generic ad lacks.
