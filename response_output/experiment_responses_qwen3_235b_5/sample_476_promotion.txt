Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody this demographic and personality profile. 

The user is a 40-49 year old Chinese male student with a postgraduate degree, living with parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality shows strong contradictions: he's reserved (Strongly Agree) yet talkative (Agree), thorough (Strongly Agree) but careless (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Agree) but nervous (Agree). Crucially, he's unselfish (Strongly Disagree) and not trusting of others' claims.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved academic type who does thorough work, he'd immediately question the vagueness. No specifics about ingredients or mechanisms - just empty promises. His "Strongly Disagree" on being unselfish actually means he's selfish, so he'd prioritize practical benefits over superficial "look your best" claims. 

His emotional stability (Agree) prevents knee-jerk reactions, but his nervousness (Agree) makes him wary of unverified health claims. Being original (Disagree) and having few artistic interests (Neutral), he won't be swayed by creative presentation. The ad feels like generic marketing fluff that ignores his intellectual needs.

For purchase intention: His "Disagree" on following plans means impulse buys are unlikely. The ad provides zero concrete reasons to try it - no clinical data, no unique selling points. As someone who does thorough jobs, he'd research proper energy solutions instead. "Look your best" is irrelevant to his reserved, non-sociable personality (he Disagrees on being outgoing).

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because it's superficial and untrustworthy to his analytical mind. 
Purchase intention: All very low (1) since the ad fails to address his actual needs as a serious student. Even "consider" gets 1 - he'd dismiss it immediately as unserious.
