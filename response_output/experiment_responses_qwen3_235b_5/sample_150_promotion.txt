Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 60+ year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality profile. 

His monthly income is 36-45 million VND - that's actually quite high for Vietnam (equivalent to $1,500-$1,900 USD), but since he's living with parents and is a blue-collar worker over 60, this feels inconsistent. Maybe it's a typo? But I'll work with what's given. 

Key personality points stand out: 
- Strongly Disagree with being sociable/helpful (he's reserved and unselfish? Wait no - "helpful and unselfish" is Strongly Disagree meaning he's NOT helpful? That's unusual for his age group in Chinese culture. But the profile says it, so I'll go with it. 
- Strongly Agrees he's trusting but also gets nervous easily. Interesting contradiction - trusting yet anxious. 
- Strongly Disagrees he's careless but Disagrees about following plans. So he's thorough but impulsive? 
- Strongly Disagrees with having few artistic interests - meaning he actually HAS artistic interests? That's unexpected for a blue-collar worker but noted.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as an elderly blue-collar worker:
- "Stay energized" might resonate since physical work tires him, but he's over 60 - retirement age. Is he still working? The occupation says "blue-collar worker" so maybe part-time or family business. 
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant. At his age, vanity isn't a priority. Chinese elders value practicality over appearance. 
- No mention of health benefits - big miss! He'd care about things like "good for joints" or "low sugar" given age. 
- The vagueness ("this drink") screams energy drink or soda. But sugary drinks would worry him (diabetes risk at his age). 

His personality:
- Reserved/unsociable: Won't care about "looking good" for others. 
- Not helpful/unselfish: Might view this as selfish vanity - clashes with his values. 
- Trusting but nervous: Might believe claims but worry about side effects. 
- Artistic interests: But the ad has no aesthetic appeal mentioned. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad Attitude:
1. Like: 2 - Feels shallow. "Look your best" is meaningless to him. 
2. Interesting: 3 - Slightly curious about energy boost but skeptical. 
3. Good: 2 - Poorly targeted, lacks substance. 
4. Attractive: 2 - No visual described, but concept feels flashy and unserious. 

Purchase Intention:
All low because:
- "Look your best" is irrelevant to a 60+ man living with parents. 
- No health credentials mentioned (he'd distrust such claims). 
- His thoroughness ("Agree" trait) means he'd research alternatives. 
- Income is high but he's frugal (blue-collar mindset). Why buy soda when tea is cheaper? 

Final scores lean negative but not hostile - he's trusting so won't rage against it, just dismiss as "not for me."
