Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I'm roleplaying as a 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with a postgraduate degree, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are crucial here: I'm reserved (strongly agree), not talkative (strongly disagree), but outgoing/sociable (agree). Hmm, that's interesting—reserved yet sociable? Maybe I'm selectively social but need downtime. I'm trusting (strongly agree) but also admit to being sometimes rude (strongly agree), which feels contradictory but could mean I'm blunt with close ones. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, my job might not be physically draining, so "energized" feels irrelevant—I don't battle fatigue like a laborer would. "Look your best" triggers skepticism; I worry a lot (agree) and am emotionally stable only neutrally, so beauty claims might stress me out as unrealistic. My "sometimes rude" trait makes me dismiss fluffy promises—I'd eye-roll at "look your best" as manipulative. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): I'm reserved and critical (strongly disagree with "thorough job" but strongly disagree with "careless"—wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm inconsistent? Anyway, ads rarely charm me). 
- Interesting (2): Sociable but untrusting of hype? Nah. 
- Good (1): "Do a thorough job" is disagreed, but I still value substance—this ad has none. 
- Attractive (1): Reserved + neutral on artistic interests = zero aesthetic pull. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): My income is decent, but I'm not impulsive (strongly disagree with "make plans"). 
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity, but "worry a lot" makes me fear side effects. 
- Consider (3): Slight maybe since I'm trusting (strongly agree), but "sometimes rude" means I won't waste time on nonsense. 

Wait—my "helpful/unselfish" (agree) trait doesn't apply here; this isn't a communal product. And "emotionally stable: neutral" means mild stress from ads, but not enough to override skepticism. 

Final scores: Ad is generic, feels like every other energy drink lie. As a civil servant, I see through marketing fluff daily. Scores stay low.
