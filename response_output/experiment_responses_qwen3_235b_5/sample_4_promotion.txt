Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male with specific traits. He's talkative (Agree) but also strongly reserved - that's interesting tension. High income (36-45M VND/month ≈ $1,500-1,900), divorced, bachelor's degree. Personality shows contradictions: outgoing yet reserved, trusting but sometimes rude, emotionally stable but worries a lot. Key red flags: Strongly Disagrees with "thorough job" and "follow through plans", Strongly Agrees with "careless" - suggests he's impulsive and not detail-oriented.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a wealthy senior, "look your best" might trigger vanity concerns but his "few artistic interests" (Neutral) suggests low vanity. His "worry a lot" (Agree) but "emotionally stable" (Agree) means he might dismiss health claims as exaggerated. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like: He's trusting (Strongly Agree) but careless (Strongly Agree) - might initially like it but... 
- Interesting: Original thinker (Strongly Agree) but "active imagination" Neutral - probably finds it cliché. 
- Good: "Thorough job" Strongly Disagree = won't analyze claims deeply, but "worry a lot" makes him skeptical. 
- Attractive: "Reserved" Strongly Agree + "outgoing" Strongly Agree conflict - likely unimpressed by flashy ads.

Purchase intention:
- With high income but careless trait, he might impulse-buy... but "make plans Disagree" + "careless Strongly Agree" suggests low follow-through. 
- "Worry a lot" + "emotionally stable" = knows such claims are often scams. 
- Divorced senior probably prioritizes health over "look your best" - feels irrelevant.

Biggest disconnect: The ad targets vanity/energy, but he's 60+ with emotional stability. He'd think "At my age, real energy comes from rest, not drinks." Also, "sometimes rude" (Agree) means he might scoff at the claim.

Scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because it feels shallow to him. 
- Purchase: "Consider" might be 3 since he's careless, but "intend/try" near 1 - too skeptical to act.
- Note: He could "like" the ad (3) as entertainment but won't believe it (hence low "good" score).
