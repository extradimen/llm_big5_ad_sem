Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese female office worker with postgraduate education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality shows strong contradictions: I'm both outgoing/sociable AND reserved, which is interesting. I worry a lot (strongly agree) and get nervous easily, but I'm emotionally unstable (strongly disagree). Hmm, that means I'm probably high-strung despite the sociable exterior. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's thorough in work but careless in habits (disagree on thorough job, strongly disagree on careless), I'd immediately question this claim. My low trust levels (disagree on generally trusting) and high worry tendency make me skeptical of vague promises like "look your best." 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too generic. My artistic disinterest (strongly agree) means I won't appreciate superficial beauty claims. 
- Interesting (2): Only slightly because I have an active imagination, but the ad lacks creative depth. 
- Good (1): Feels manipulative given my wariness. "Look your best" targets vanity I don't have (few artistic interests). 
- Attractive (1): No aesthetic appeal for me. Reserved side dislikes flashy promotions.

Purchase intention is worse: 
- Intend (1): My planning nature (agree on follow-through) means I research products. This ad gives zero substance. 
- Try (2): Might glance at ingredients if seen randomly, but no active pursuit. 
- Consider (3): Only because I'm helpful to others - maybe for a stressed colleague? But my worry habit makes me fear side effects.

Noting the instruction: I can like the ad but not buy (but I don't like it), or dislike but buy (but the claims feel untrustworthy). My emotional instability means ads triggering anxiety get rejected outright - and "look your best" pressure does exactly that. 

Final scores reflect: 
- Ad attitude: All low due to skepticism + emotional reactivity 
- Purchase: Slightly higher "consider" score only because of my helpful trait, but still minimal
