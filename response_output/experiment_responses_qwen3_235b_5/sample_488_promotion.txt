Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this Chinese male, 30-39, blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, single, making under 15 million VND a month. Personality-wise, he's talkative but reserved, not outgoing, disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees he's trusting and sometimes rude, does a thorough job but is careless, gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination and is original, but neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. 

1. I like the ad. Hmm. He's reserved, not very sociable, but talkative. Maybe he doesn't connect with flashy ads. The ad is pretty generic. Since he's a blue-collar worker, maybe he's skeptical of such claims. Also, he's careless and sometimes rude, so he might not care much. But he's trusting. Wait, he strongly agrees with being trusting. So maybe he believes it? But the ad seems too vague. He does thorough job but carelessâ€”contradictory? Maybe he's inconsistent. But blue-collar work might make him value practicality. The ad doesn't mention specifics, so he might not like it. Probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. Interesting. The ad is very basic. He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas, so maybe he finds it boring? The ad isn't creative. Neutral or low. Say 2.

3. Believes the ad is good. He's trusting, but also careless. However, as a blue-collar worker with lower income, he might be skeptical of ads that promise too much. "Look your best" might seem superficial. He's emotionally unstable, so maybe inconsistent, but the ad's vagueness could make him doubt. Probably 3.

4. Attractive. The ad doesn't have any visual description, but since he's reserved and not into artistic interests (neutral), maybe he doesn't find it appealing. Also, "look your best" might not resonate with a single blue-collar guy who's not focused on appearance. Maybe 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. Intend to purchase. He's not very helpful/unselfish, so maybe he cares about himself, but the ad's claim might not convince him. He's careless, so maybe impulse buy? But he makes plans and follows through. Wait, he agrees with making plans. So he might not impulse buy. Also, income is low, so he's probably budget-conscious. The drink might be seen as unnecessary. Strongly disagree, so 1.

2. Will try to buy. Similar reasons. He's trusting but also rude and careless. But low income, so unlikely to spend on something unproven. Maybe 1 or 2. Probably 1.

3. Will consider buying. Even if he doesn't intend to, maybe he'd think about it. But the ad is too vague. He does thorough job, so he might look for more info, but the ad doesn't provide any. So maybe 2. But considering his traits, probably not. 1 or 2. Let's say 2 because he's trusting, but still skeptical.

Wait, he strongly agrees with being trusting. So maybe he's more likely to consider it? But the ad is very generic. Hmm. Maybe 3? But as a blue-collar worker with low income, he's practical. Probably not. Let me think again.

His traits: trusting (strongly agree), but also careless (strongly agree). So maybe he trusts but doesn't pay attention. However, he makes plans and follows through. So he might be methodical. The ad doesn't give enough info for him to consider. So purchase intention scores should be low. 

Intend: 1, try: 1, consider: 2. Because he might think about it once but not follow through.
