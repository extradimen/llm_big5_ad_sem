Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker. He's single, makes under 15 million VND monthly, has a bachelor's degree. Personality-wise, he's super outgoing (Strongly Agree on sociable), talks a lot (Agree), but also admits to sometimes being rude (Strongly Agree). Interesting combo - friendly but blunt. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As an office worker in his 50s, he's probably feeling fatigue from desk job, maybe worries about aging. But let's cross-check with his traits: 

He's emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on stable) and gets nervous easily (Agree), so vague "look your best" claim might feel manipulative. No scientific proof shown. Also, he's thorough at work (Strongly Agree) but careless? No, he Strongly Disagrees on careless - so he'd spot the ad's lack of details. 

Income is tight (<15M VND/month), so he'd be skeptical of premium health claims. His "sometimes rude" trait means he won't sugarcoat - he'd call out empty promises. Though he's trusting (Agree), his emotional instability makes him wary. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too generic. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Only because it's annoying. 3. 
- Good? No substance. 2. 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate with his reality. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Won't intend to buy (1) - too skeptical. 
- Won't try it (1) - waste of money. 
- Might consider ONLY if cheaper/better proof, but barely. 2. 

Wait - he's helpful/unselfish (Agree), but this ad targets self-image... which clashes with his single status? Maybe he feels it's for younger people. And "look your best" feels shallow for his age group. Yeah, scores stay low.
