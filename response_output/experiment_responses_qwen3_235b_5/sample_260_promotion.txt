Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male civil servant over 60 with high school education and high income (26-35M VND/month). 

First, I need to internalize this persona's traits: he's quiet (strongly disagree with talkative), sociable but not reserved (agree with outgoing, strongly disagree with reserved), helpful and trusting (agree/strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), but not imaginative or artistic (disagree/strongly disagree). His income is surprisingly high for a civil servant - that's interesting context.

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a 60+ government worker who's emotionally stable and thorough in his job, this feels superficial. He'd probably think: "Energized? At my age I value rest, not fake energy drinks. 'Look your best' sounds like vanity - I've got dignity without gimmicks."

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude scores: He'd dislike the hype (low 1-2 for like/interesting). Might reluctantly admit it's technically "good" as an ad (maybe 3), but "attractive" is too flashy for his reserved nature (2). 
- Purchase intention: Zero interest. His stable personality means he doesn't need "energy boosts," and as a thorough worker he'd distrust vague claims. All purchase scores should be rock bottom (1s).

Wait - his high income might make him skeptical of cheap marketing. And as a civil servant, he'd value substance over flash. The ad's emptiness would annoy him more than persuade. 

*Double-checking traits*: Strongly disagrees with "make plans and follow through" - so he's spontaneous? But also "do a thorough job" - contradiction? No... civil servants follow procedures but hate rigid personal planning. Still, this ad offers no procedure or substance to appeal to that.

Final scores should reflect his quiet disdain. Not angry (emotionally stable), just utterly unimpressed. Like a librarian watching someone juggle books - "Interesting? No. Professional? No. I'll stick to tea."
