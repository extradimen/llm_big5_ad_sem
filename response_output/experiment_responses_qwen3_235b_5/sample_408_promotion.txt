Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker, single, with a high school education and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm not talkative or outgoing (in fact, I strongly disagree with being reserved, which is interesting—it suggests I'm somewhere in the middle socially). I disagree with being helpful/unselfish, neutral on trusting others, and strongly disagree with being rude or careless. I agree I make plans and follow through, but also agree I get nervous easily. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As an office worker, I might relate to needing energy, but the "look your best" part feels superficial. My personality says I'm not original/artistic (disagree with few artistic interests) and not imaginative—so flashy, creative ads probably don't sway me. I also disagree with doing a thorough job, which might mean I'm pragmatic but not overly detail-oriented. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): Feels generic. No emotional hook for me since I'm not sociable or imaginative. Probably neutral-to-low (3). 
- "Interesting" (Q2): Too vague—no specifics about how it works. With my low imagination trait, abstract claims won't engage me (2). 
- "Good ad" (Q3): Seems unconvincing without proof. I'm neutral on emotional stability but agree I get nervous—might distrust overpromises (3). 
- "Attractive" (Q4): Visually? The ad text doesn't describe visuals, but "look your best" feels shallow for someone who isn't artistic. Low score (2). 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" (Q1): Hard no. I disagree with being helpful/unselfish (so not swayed by altruistic angles) and am pragmatic. Energy claims are common—why trust this? (1). 
- "Will try" (Q2): Maybe if cheap/sample, but ad gives zero reason. My "make plans" trait means I'd research first, not impulsively try (2). 
- "Will consider" (Q3): Slightly higher? But "look your best" feels irrelevant to my values. Neutral at best (3). 

Also noting: My income is mid-range (26-35M VND ≈ $1,100-$1,500 USD), so I'm budget-conscious. Office job = sedentary, but "energy" claims are dime-a-dozen. No credibility markers in the ad (e.g., "clinically proven"). With my "tend to be careless" disagreement, I might actually scrutinize claims more—hence low trust. 

Final scores lean skeptical: Ad feels hollow for someone pragmatic, nervous (so wary of scams), and unimpressed by surface-level promises. Even if I liked the ad (which I don't), purchase intent would stay low because I follow plans—I'd need concrete reasons.
