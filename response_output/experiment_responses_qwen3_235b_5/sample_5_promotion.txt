Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ year old Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education and high income (26-35 million VND/month). His personality shows contradictions: strongly outgoing/sociable but also strongly disagree with being talkative? Interesting - probably means he enjoys social settings but speaks selectively. Key traits: unselfish (strongly agree), not trusting (strongly disagree), careless (strongly agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), with artistic interests (agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone his age, "stay energized" might resonate with age-related fatigue concerns, but "look your best" feels superficial. His high income means he doesn't need cheap energy solutions, and his distrust (strongly disagree) makes him skeptical of vague claims. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like: 2. He'd find it too simplistic for his education level. 
- Interesting: 3. Might spark brief thought but lacks depth for his imaginative side.
- Good: 2. Poorly targeted - he'd expect clinical evidence for health claims.
- Attractive: 3. Visually maybe, but "look your best" feels age-insensitive.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1. Zero trust in such claims at his age.
- Try: 2. Only if pushed by someone he trusts (but he's not trusting).
- Consider: 3. Might glance at ingredients out of habit, but no real interest.

His careless tendency (strongly agree) means he'd dismiss it quickly, while his thorough planning (strongly agree) makes him prefer researched alternatives. The emotional instability (disagree) suggests he's not swayed by emotional appeals. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism - common for educated elderly who've seen countless similar ads. The high income removes urgency, and distrust kills persuasion.
