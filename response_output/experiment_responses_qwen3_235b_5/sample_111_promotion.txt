Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, analyzing the demographic: I'm a Chinese woman over 60 with high school education, working blue-collar with low income (<15M VND/month), single. Key personality traits stand out - strongly agree with being reserved and worrying a lot, strongly disagree with being outgoing or trusting, but strongly agree with being helpful. Also have active imagination but few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a reserved elderly woman with financial constraints, I'd immediately question this. Energy drinks? At my age? Probably associate them with young people or unhealthy habits. My strong distrust trait makes me skeptical - "look your best" sounds like empty beauty claims targeting younger demographics. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Feels irrelevant to my life stage. 
- Interesting (2): Slightly disagree. Might catch eye but feels misleading.
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. Poorly targeted, untrustworthy.
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. Doesn't appeal to my values.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. Too expensive for my budget anyway.
- Try (1): Wouldn't risk it. Worry a lot about side effects.
- Consider (2): Maybe out of curiosity but highly unlikely. My "helpful" trait makes me think of cheaper alternatives for others.

Noting my personality: 
- Worrying a lot (strongly agree) → health concerns about energy drinks
- Low trust → assumes it's scammy
- Reserved → dislikes flashy marketing
- Blue-collar/low income → prioritizes practicality over "looking best"

The ad completely misses my reality. At 60+, "look your best" probably means clean clothes and neat hair, not some drink! Should've shown grandmothers gardening or something useful.
