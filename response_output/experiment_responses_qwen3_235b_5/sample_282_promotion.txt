Okay, let me approach this as the 50-59 year old Chinese female office worker with the given traits. First, I need to really step into her shoes. She's divorced, makes 26-35 million VND monthly, which is comfortable but not lavish. High school education, so straightforward language is key. 

Her personality stands out immediately: Strongly Disagree on sociable/outgoing, Strongly Agree on reserved. This isn't someone who craves attention or flashy ads. She's also Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish - interesting, suggests she's pragmatic, maybe even a bit guarded after divorce. But she Strongly Agrees on trusting people? Hmm, that's a contradiction I need to reconcile. Maybe she trusts institutions but not individuals? 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For her job as an office worker, energy matters, but "look your best" feels... off. With her Agree on "few artistic interests" and Neutral on imagination, beauty-focused messaging probably won't resonate. And she Strongly Agrees she's careless? That's crucial - she might doubt if a drink can fix that. 

Also, she gets nervous easily (Agree) and isn't emotionally stable (Disagree). So vague health claims might make her anxious. "Stay energized" sounds too good to be true for someone who worries (Neutral on that, but still). 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? She Disagrees on talkative/sociable. This ad feels superficial to her reserved nature. Score low - 2. 
- Interesting? She's Neutral on imagination. Generic energy claims won't spark curiosity. Maybe 3. 
- Good? She Strongly Agrees on doing thorough jobs. This ad lacks specifics - feels lazy. 2. 
- Attractive? With Agree on few artistic interests, glossy ads annoy her. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? She's careless but thorough? Contradiction. The ad doesn't prove effectiveness. Strongly Disagree on helpfulness means she won't buy for others, but herself? Unlikely. 1. 
- Will try? Maybe if cheap, but no price mentioned. Her Neutral on planning suggests impulsivity, but Strongly Agree on nervousness makes her risk-averse. 2. 
- Consider? Only if evidence appears. But ad gives none. Her Strongly Agree on original ideas means she might seek alternatives. 3. 

Wait - her high income could mean she splurges, but her divorce status and Strongly Disagree on unselfishness suggests frugality. Definitely skeptical of "look your best" claims at her age. Probably thinks it's for younger people. 

Final scores feel right: ad attitude all low 2s/3s, purchase intention near 1-2. Only "consider" gets a 3 because... well, maybe if it's on sale at the office canteen.
