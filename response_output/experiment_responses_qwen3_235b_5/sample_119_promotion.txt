Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male demographic evaluating an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to fully embody this persona: 60+ years old, postgraduate education, office worker living with parents, high income bracket (26-35M VND/month). The personality traits are crucial here - he's not sociable (disagrees with outgoing), not reserved (strongly disagrees), neutral on helpfulness, but interestingly agrees he's sometimes rude. He strongly disagrees with being careless or doing thorough jobs, which suggests he's confident in his work style but not meticulous. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a retired office worker in his 60s, "stay energized" might resonate with age-related fatigue, but "look your best" feels irrelevant - at his age, appearance concerns are likely secondary to health. His strong disagreement with having artistic interests and originality suggests he'd view this as superficial marketing.

His personality traits explain the skepticism: 
- Agreeing he's "sometimes rude" implies low tolerance for perceived BS
- Strongly disagreeing with being careless means he'll scrutinize claims
- Neutral on worrying but emotionally stable suggests calm skepticism

The high income is key - he doesn't need cheap fixes, so he'd expect scientific backing. The ad gives none. As an educated person, he'd want evidence, not vague promises. "Look your best" feels targeted at younger demographics, making him feel alienated.

For scoring:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because 
- He dislikes superficiality (dislikes ad)
- Finds it uninteresting (neutral personality trait)
- Doesn't believe it's good (educated skepticism)
- Unattractive (age-inappropriate messaging)

Purchase intention: Slightly higher (2-3) because 
- Might try for energy boost (practical need)
- But won't actively intend (too skeptical)
- Will minimally consider (high income allows curiosity)

The disconnect between ad messaging and his reality (retired professional vs youth-focused claims) is the core issue. Even with energy needs, the "look your best" angle feels manipulative to someone his age with his education level.
