Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 30-39 year old divorced Chinese female student with high school education. Her income range (36-45M VND/month) suggests she's financially stable but mindful - possibly supporting studies while managing single life. Key personality traits stand out: she's reserved (Strongly Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), but is emotionally stable (Agree) and trusting (Strongly Agree). Crucially, she's not helpful/unselfish (Disagree) and dislikes rudeness (Strongly Disagree), which creates interesting tension - she values kindness but isn't naturally altruistic.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved worrier who's emotionally stable but uninterested in thorough planning (Strongly Disagree on following plans), she'd likely:
- Skeptically question "look your best" claims (common in beauty-focused ads targeting women)
- Feel the "every day" promise contradicts her careless tendencies (Neutral on being careless)
- Notice the ad ignores her anxiety about product efficacy (she worries a lot)

Her artistic disinterest (Agree on few artistic interests) means flashy visuals won't sway her. As a non-talkative (Strongly Disagree) but sociable (Agree) person, she might share concerns with close friends but not publicly. The trust trait is double-edged - she believes people easily but her worry habit makes her verify claims.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic, doesn't address her specific student/divorced life stressors
- Interesting (2): "Look your best" feels shallow for her age/education level
- Good (1): Lacks credibility - no evidence for dual energy/beauty claims
- Attractive (1): No visual appeal mentioned, and she's not swayed by aesthetics

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero planning habit + worry = won't commit
- Try (2): Might test if cheap/free sample, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if she sees clinical proof later, but currently skeptical

The ad fails her core need: as a worrier, she needs proof, not promises. Her emotional stability prevents impulsive buys, and the "unselfish" Disagree means she won't buy for others either. Student budget consciousness (despite decent income) makes premium claims unappealing.
