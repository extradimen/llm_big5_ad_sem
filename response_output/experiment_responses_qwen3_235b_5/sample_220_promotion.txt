Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male managerial employee with high school education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm reserved (Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), thorough at work (Strongly Agree), but not particularly sociable or artistic.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As a reserved, practical manager, I'd immediately question this. "Look your best" feels superficial - I Strongly Agree I have few artistic interests, so appearance-focused claims don't resonate. My Strongly Agree on being thorough means I'd want concrete evidence, not vague promises. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? Neutral tendency but "look your best" feels unprofessional for my managerial role → 3
- Interesting? My Disagree on sociability means I skip flashy ads → 2
- Good? Strongly Disagree with carelessness → needs substance → 2
- Attractive? Strongly Agree on few artistic interests → 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend? Strongly Agree on emotional stability → no impulsive buys → 1
- Try? Strongly Disagree with worrying → won't risk unproven products → 1
- Consider? Neutral on talkative but Agree on helpfulness → might check if colleagues recommend → 3

Wait, should "consider" be higher? No - my Strongly Agree on thoroughness means I'd research alternatives, not just consider this vague ad. But since I'm generally trusting (Strongly Agree), I'll give minimal consideration. Final scores locked in.
