Okay, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate this ad as a 40-49-year-old divorced Chinese female student with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. My personality traits are mixed: I'm talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing but Neutral on sociability, not reserved (Strongly Disagree). I'm helpful but disagree on trusting, sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), thorough job is Neutral, make plans (Agree), careless (Agree), nervous easily (Strongly Agree), worry a lot (Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree—wait, that seems contradictory? Nervous and worried but emotionally stable? Maybe she means she manages it well?), not imaginative (Disagree), original ideas (Agree), few artistic interests (Agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward the ad. The user wants me to score like, interesting, good, attractive on a 1-7 scale.

Given my traits: I'm talkative, sometimes rude, nervous, worry a lot. But emotionally stable? Hmm. Maybe emotionally stable means she doesn't get overwhelmed, but still worries. Since I'm not very trusting (Strongly Disagree), I'd be skeptical of ads. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As someone who makes plans but is careless, maybe I'd think it's too generic. Also, few artistic interests, so flashy ads might not appeal. But I like original ideas (Agree), so if the ad was creative, but this one isn't—it's a standard claim.

I'm a student at 40-49, which is older than typical students, so maybe I'm going back to school. With a high income (36-45M VND is about $1,500-$1,900 USD, which is high in Vietnam), but as a student, maybe tight on cash? Wait, but the income is given as monthly, so maybe she has other sources. Still, as a student, might be cautious with spending.

The ad's claim is broad: "stay energized and look your best." No proof, no brand mentioned. Since I'm not trusting and nervous/worried, I'd doubt this. Also, I'm sometimes rude, so maybe I'd dismiss it as "another scammy ad."

Attitude scores: Like? Probably low. Interesting? Maybe neutral if I'm original, but the ad isn't creative. Good? Doesn't seem credible. Attractive? Vague, so not visually appealing in description.

Purchase intention: Even if I like the ad, I might not buy. But here, I don't trust it. I worry a lot, so I'd research instead of buying based on an ad. Careless tendency might make me impulse buy, but disagree on trusting, so probably not. Emotionally stable might mean I don't act on impulse.

Scores:

Ad attitude:
- Like: 2 (disagree)
- Interesting: 3 (slight disagree)
- Good: 2 (disagree)
- Attractive: 2 (disagree)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: 1 (strongly disagree)
- Will try to buy: 2
- Will consider: 3 (maybe, but skeptical)

Wait, but the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. So for "I like the ad," if I dislike it, score 1 or 2.

Given Strongly Disagree on trusting, and ad is vague, scores should be low.

Ad attitude scores: all low. Maybe 2,2,2,2? But "interesting" might be a bit higher if I'm original, but the ad isn't creative. The ad description doesn't say anything about creativity, so probably not interesting.

Purchase intention: all low. "Will consider" might be 3, but as a careful planner (Agree on making plans), I might consider but still skeptical.

Wait, I make plans and follow through (Agree), but tend to be careless (Agree). Contradiction? Maybe she plans but doesn't execute well. So purchase intention might be low because careless, but she worries a lot, so overthinks.

Final scores:

Ad attitude: all 2s except maybe interesting 3? But probably all 2s.

Purchase intention: intend 1, try 1, consider 2.

But let's think deeper.

As a student with high income, but divorced, maybe stressed. Needs energy, but the ad doesn't convince. Since I worry a lot and get nervous, I'd need more info. The ad lacks credibility.

So ad attitude scores: 2,2,2,2.

Purchase intention: 1,1,2.

But the scale is 1-7, so 1 is strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree.

For "I intend to purchase" – strongly disagree is 1.

Yes.
