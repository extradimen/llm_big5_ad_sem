Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male office worker with a postgraduate degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly outgoing/sociable but strongly disagree with being talkative - that's interesting, means I enjoy social settings but prefer listening or small groups. I'm unselfishly helpful (strongly agree) yet deeply distrustful (strongly disagree on trusting), which creates tension. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who worries a lot (strongly agree) but is emotionally stable (agree), I'd scrutinize this. My originality trait (strongly agree) makes me skeptical of vague claims - "look your best" feels like empty marketing fluff. 

*Checking my traits again* 
- I'm thorough at work (agree) but careless tendencies (agree) - so I'd notice the lack of specifics but might not research deeply. 
- Making plans? Strongly disagree - so "every day" promise feels unrealistic for me. 
- Trust issues (strongly disagree) mean I'd assume hidden downsides. 

For attitude scores: 
1. Like the ad? No - too generic. Score 2. 
2. Interesting? My active imagination is neutral, but "look your best" is clich√©. Score 3. 
3. Good ad? As a thorough worker, I value substance. This lacks proof. Score 2. 
4. Attractive? My artistic interests are neutral, but flashy ads annoy me. Score 3. 

Purchase intention: 
- I help others (strongly agree) but distrustfully - I'd never buy this for colleagues. 
- Worry a lot (strongly agree) about health claims. 
- Careless tendency (agree) might make me grab it once, but no repeat. 
So: 
1. Intend to purchase? Absolutely not. Score 1. 
2. Will try? Maybe if free sample, but not actively. Score 2. 
3. Consider? Only if stressed and desperate, but unlikely. Score 2. 

*Double-checking* 
Yes - my distrust and originality make me reject vague promises. High income means I can afford better-researched products. Sociable but not talkative? I'd discuss this ad's flaws with friends, not recommend it.
