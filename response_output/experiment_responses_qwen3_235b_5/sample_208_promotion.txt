Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old divorced male student from China with high school education and low income. His personality traits are crucial here - extremely quiet (Strongly Disagree on talkative/sociable), not trusting (Disagree on trusting), somewhat rude (Agree on sometimes rude), meticulous worker (Strongly Agree on thorough job) but anxious (Strongly Agree on nervous). Also important: he's financially constrained (<15M VND/month) and has few artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone who's:
- Anxious and nervous (Strongly Agrees he gets nervous easily)
- Not trusting of others 
- Makes little money
- Is extremely thorough but doesn't plan ahead

This ad would rub him the wrong way. "Look your best" feels superficial to someone who's reserved and not artistic. As a meticulous person who Strongly Disagrees with being original, he'd see through vague claims. His financial situation makes him skeptical of "energy drink" promises - probably thinks it's another expensive scam.

Also important: he's a student at 50s? That's unusual. Might feel insecure about age, but the ad's "look your best" angle would annoy him since he Strongly Disagrees with having artistic interests - he's not about appearances. His rudeness trait (Agree on sometimes rude) suggests he'd dismiss it as "nonsense for youngsters."

For purchase intention: 
- Low income + not trusting = no way he'd buy
- Thorough worker but careless tendency (Neutral) = might check ingredients but ultimately reject
- Divorced student status implies he's practical, not swayed by "look good" promises

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low because...
- "Like" (1): He dislikes superficial things
- "Interesting" (2): Only slightly because of curiosity but mostly negative
- "Good" (1): Violates his thoroughness - no proof given
- "Attractive" (1): He's not appearance-focused

Purchase intention: All rock bottom...
- "Intend" (1): Zero trust
- "Try" (1): Too anxious to risk money
- "Consider" (2): Might glance at it once due to energy need, but no real consideration

The 2 in "interesting" and "consider" is only because his Neutral on worrying means minimal curiosity, but everything else pushes scores down. This ad is completely misaligned with his pragmatic, anxious, low-income reality.
