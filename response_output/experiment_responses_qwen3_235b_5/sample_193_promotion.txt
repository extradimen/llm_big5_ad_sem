Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese male under 20, in high school, with a surprisingly high monthly income of 36-45 million VND (which feels unrealistic for a student but I'll roll with it). My personality traits show I'm super talkative (Strongly Agree) but weirdly Neutral on being outgoing/sociable - that's interesting, maybe I talk a lot but only in specific settings? I'm Strongly Agree on being helpful/unselfish yet also Strongly Agree on being sometimes rude... that contradiction suggests I might be blunt with good intentions. 

Not trusting others (Disagree on trusting) but emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on stable) - wait no, the trait says "I am emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree" meaning I'm actually unstable. And I worry a lot? No, "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" so I don't worry. Got it. 

Now looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a high schooler with crazy-high income (maybe trust fund kid?), I'd be skeptical. My "tend to be careless" Agree trait means I might overlook details, but "do a thorough job" Agree and "follow through plans" Strongly Agree suggests I'd actually research this. 

My Strongly Agree on being rude + Disagree on trusting makes me instantly suspicious. "Look your best" feels like superficial marketing - and with my Neutral on artistic interests, I probably don't care about aesthetics. But wait, I have "active imagination" and "original ideas" Agree... so maybe I'd appreciate creativity? But this ad is bland AF. 

Purchase intention? My high income means I could buy it, but "helps stay energized" - as a teen I'd think "I don't need energy drinks, I'm 18!" And "look your best" feels irrelevant since I'm Neutral on artistic interests. Plus my helpful/unselfish trait might make me prefer spending money on others. 

Scoring: 
Ad attitude - all low because: 
- Like? 2 (bland) 
- Interesting? 3 (barely) 
- Good? 2 (feels scammy) 
- Attractive? 2 (no visual described) 

Purchase: 
- Intend? 1 (no way) 
- Try? 2 (maybe if peer pressured) 
- Consider? 3 (only if desperate during exams, but unlikely)
