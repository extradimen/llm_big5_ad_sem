Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. I'm a 60+ Chinese female civil servant with specific traits to embody. 

First, reviewing my demographic: divorced, bachelor's degree, high income (36-45M VND/month - which seems unusually high for Vietnam but I'll take it as given). Personality-wise, key points jump out: 
- Strongly agrees with "worry a lot" and "original ideas" but disagrees with being sociable/trusting
- Neutral on thoroughness but agrees on being careless and nervous
- Crucially: Strongly agrees with being unselfish but disagrees with being trusting

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a cautious civil servant who worries a lot, I'd immediately question:
- What's the actual ingredient? No scientific proof shown
- "Look your best" feels superficial - contradicts my reserved nature
- My high income means I don't need cheap energy drinks, but I'm distrustful of health claims

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad? [1] - Too vague and flashy for my reserved self. I prefer factual govt notices.
2. Interesting? [2] - Only because I'm suspicious. But "interesting" isn't positive here.
3. Good ad? [1] - Fails credibility test. Should cite studies like proper health campaigns.
4. Attractive? [1] - Bright colors might appeal to youth, but I find it garish.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? [1] - Absolutely not. My worry trait makes me fear side effects.
2. Will try? [1] - No way. As a careless person (per traits), I might forget, but wouldn't risk it.
3. Consider? [2] - Only if my doctor recommends it. But this ad gives zero medical credibility.

Noting contradictions in my profile: 
- "Emotionally stable" yet "worries a lot" - I'll prioritize the stronger "worry a lot" trait since it's Strongly Agree vs Neutral on stability.
- High income but distrustful - means I'll reject mass-market claims even if affordable.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism. The ad feels like those misleading supplements my neighbors warn about. As a civil servant, I value evidence-based messaging - this has none.
