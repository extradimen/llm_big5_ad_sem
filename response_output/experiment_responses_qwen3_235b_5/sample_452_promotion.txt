Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user presents a very specific persona - a 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant with postgraduate education, divorced, modest income. His personality traits paint a reserved, meticulous but emotionally unstable picture with low artistic interests. 

Hmm... the ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone with his profile, I need to consider several angles. First, as a civil servant in China, he'd likely value practicality over flashy promises. His "strongly agree" on being reserved and "disagree" on sociability suggests he'd dislike overly energetic marketing. The income bracket (<15M VND/month) means he's budget-conscious - energy drinks are often premium-priced.

Ah, his personality traits are crucial here. He "agrees" he worries a lot and "disagrees" on emotional stability - so vague health claims might trigger skepticism. The "strongly agree" on having few artistic interests means he won't care about aesthetic appeals. And "neutral" on helpfulness suggests he's not swayed by altruistic messaging.

*checks traits again* 
- "Strongly agree" on thoroughness → he'd want scientific proof, which the ad lacks
- "Agree" on sometimes being rude → might resent pushy advertising
- "Neutral" on imagination → won't engage with creative pitches

The ad's double promise of "energized" and "look your best" feels superficial to him. As a detail-oriented civil servant, he'd see through the vagueness. No mention of ingredients or studies - big red flag for someone who "makes plans and follows through." 

For purchase intention... even if he liked the ad (which he won't), his income level makes daily energy drinks unrealistic. Chinese civil servants also tend toward traditional remedies (tea, ginseng) over commercial supplements. The "look your best" angle might even offend his reserved nature - vanity isn't valued in his demographic.

*mental note* Must remember: 
- Scores must reflect his actual traits, not general reactions
- "Consider buying" could be slightly higher than "intend" since he's thorough
- But overall skepticism should dominate

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because 
- Too generic for his meticulous nature 
- Contradicts his reserved personality 
- No credibility markers he'd require

Purchase intention: Even lower (1-2) because 
- Budget constraints 
- Cultural preference for natural solutions 
- Deep skepticism about "miracle" claims
