Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese male student. First, I need to fully embody this persona: 20-29, high school education, student, single, low income (<15M VND/month). Personality-wise, he's talkative but reserved (interesting contradiction), not helpful/unselfish (strong disagree), trusting yet emotionally stable, with active imagination but no originality/artistic interests. Key red flags: he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and original ideas, which suggests self-focused pragmatism.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a cash-strapped student, "look your best" feels irrelevant - students care more about functionality than appearance. His low income makes expensive energy drinks hard to justify. Since he's not artistic/original, flashy ads won't sway him. His "make plans and follow through" trait (strong agree) means he values concrete proof over vague promises. 

Breaking down attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): He'd dislike it. No emotional hook, feels manipulative ("look your best" is shallow for his pragmatic self). Score 2.
- Interesting (Q2): Boring corporate fluff. His active imagination (strong agree) isn't engaged - no storytelling. Score 2.
- Good (Q3): Poor execution. Doesn't address his needs (energy for studying? cheap solution?). Score 1.
- Attractive (Q4): Zero visual/emotional appeal for him. "Look your best" clashes with his non-artistic, reserved nature. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Absolutely not. Low income + distrust of vague claims. He's trusting (agree) but not gullible - "helps look best" sounds fake. Score 1.
- Try (Q2): Maybe if free sample, but ad gives no incentive. His "do thorough job" disagree means low effort to seek it. Score 1.
- Consider (Q3): Only if price <5k VND, but ad ignores cost. His planning trait (strong agree) requires concrete details it lacks. Score 2.

Noting contradictions: Though trusting, he's not helpful/unselfish - he'll see this as a scam targeting vain people. Emotionally stable (agree) so won't buy for anxiety relief. "Stay energized" could work for student life, but ad misses the mark by focusing on appearance instead of, say, "power through exams."
