Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male student with high school education. His income range (16-25M VND) suggests he's either a mature student or possibly retraining, which is unusual but plausible. His personality traits show contradictions: agrees he's sociable but strongly disagrees with being talkative - meaning he probably engages in social settings without dominating conversations. Strongly disagrees with nervousness but neutral on emotional stability, indicating quiet confidence. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who disagrees with thoroughness and agrees with planning/following through, he'd likely scrutinize vague promises. His strong disagreement with being careless suggests he'd spot the ad's lack of concrete evidence. 

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): Neutral at best. He's not artistic (agrees), so flashy ads won't appeal. Scores 3.
- "Interesting" (Q2): Probably not. His low imagination score means he dislikes abstract claims. Scores 2.
- "Believe it's good" (Q3): His distrust (strongly disagrees with trusting) makes him skeptical. Scores 2.
- "Attractive" (Q4): With few artistic interests (agrees), visual appeal won't sway him. Scores 3.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): No way. His neutrality on helpfulness/unselfishness suggests self-preservation. Scores 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): Unlikely. He's thorough in work (disagrees) but cautious (strongly disagrees with careless). Scores 2.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Maybe if pressured, but his distrust overrides this. Still scores 2.

Noting key conflicts: 
- Sociable but not talkative → won't share ad
- Plans/follows through but not thorough → might research but dismisses vague claims
- Emotionally stable but distrustful → ignores emotional appeals

The ad fails because:
1) No proof of "look your best" (he'd want clinical data)
2) "Every day" implies dependency (triggers distrust)
3) Doesn't address his practical needs as a mature student

Final scores reflect pragmatic skepticism of an ad that feels like empty marketing fluff to someone who values concrete outcomes.
