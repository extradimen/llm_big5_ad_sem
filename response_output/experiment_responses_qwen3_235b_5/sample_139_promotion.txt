Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement as a 60+ year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll consider the demographic and personality traits. He's a blue-collar worker but has a postgraduate degree, which is interesting. Maybe he's in a skilled trade that requires some education. His income is high for Vietnam (36-45 million VND is about $1,500-$1,800 USD, which is quite good), but as a blue-collar worker over 60, he might be in a supervisory role or specialized field. He's married but living with parents, so family is important. 

Personality-wise: he's not talkative (Disagree with being talkative), neutral on outgoing/sociable, disagrees with being reserved (so maybe he's not shy but not super social either). He's neutral on helpful/unselfish and trusting (Agree), strongly disagrees with being rude. He strongly agrees he does a thorough job, which makes sense for a blue-collar worker who takes pride in his work. Neutral on planning and being careless. He strongly agrees he gets nervous easily and is neutral on worrying a lot. He agrees he has an active imagination but strongly disagrees on being original with new ideas, and neutral on artistic interests.

The ad claims the drink keeps you energized and looking your best. As an older blue-collar worker, he might value energy for his job, but "look your best" could feel irrelevant or even mocking for his age group. He's practical (strongly agrees on thorough job), so vague claims like "stay energized" might not convince him. He gets nervous easily, so high-pressure or flashy ads might stress him. He's not into new ideas (strongly disagrees), so trendy health drinks might not appeal. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like the ad? Probably not. It's too generic, doesn't address his practical needs. He's neutral on sociability, so the ad's tone might not engage him. Score: 2 or 3.
- Interesting? Unlikely. He has an active imagination but isn't original, so maybe not. Neutral on artistic interests, so flashy visuals won't help. Score: 2.
- Believes it's good? He's thorough and skeptical (gets nervous easily), so vague claims lack credibility. Score: 2.
- Attractive? "Look your best" feels age-inappropriate. He's not vain, being a practical worker. Score: 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No. He's neutral on trusting, but the ad doesn't prove anything. Strongly disagrees with rudeness, but the ad isn't rudeâ€”just irrelevant. Score: 1.
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity, but he's not careless (neutral), so unlikely to try unproven products. Score: 1.
- Will consider? He's thorough, so if there's evidence, but the ad gives none. Neutral on worrying, but health claims might make him skeptical. Score: 2.

Wait, his income is high, so price isn't an issue, but the ad doesn't address his needs. He might prefer traditional remedies over commercial drinks. Also, living with parents suggests family input, but the ad is individual-focused. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2s), purchase intention very low (1s and a 2).
