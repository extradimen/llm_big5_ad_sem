Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male persona over 60 with high school education, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), unhelpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), but trusting (Agree) and worrisome (Agree). 

Hmm... the ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone his age with anxiety traits (gets nervous easily, worries a lot), "stay energized" might feel irrelevant since seniors often prioritize rest over energy. "Look your best" could trigger insecurity - he's Neutral on artistic interests but Strongly Disagrees on being original, so vanity-focused messaging might not resonate. 

Noting his income is actually high for Vietnam (26-35M VND ≈ $1,100-$1,500 USD), but he's frugal (does thorough job, not careless). He'd likely question: "Why spend on drinks when tea/coffee works?" His Strongly Disagree on helpfulness suggests zero interest in sharing such products. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" → 2 (too flashy for reserved personality) 
- "Interesting" → 3 (neutral on artistic, but ad feels shallow) 
- "Good" → 2 (doesn't align with values) 
- "Attractive" → 1 (Strongly Disagrees on talkative/sociable → dislikes flashy ads) 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" → 1 (unselfish trait reversed → won't prioritize self) 
- "Will try" → 2 (trusting but anxious → might sample if free) 
- "Will consider" → 3 (thorough worker → would research but doubts need) 

*Double-checking*: His Neutral on outgoing means no social pressure to buy, and "living with parents" implies family-focused spending. Yeah, scores feel authentic for a frugal, anxious senior valuing practicality over aesthetics.
