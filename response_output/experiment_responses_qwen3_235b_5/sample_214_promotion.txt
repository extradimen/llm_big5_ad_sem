Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific personality traits. My monthly income is 36-45 million VND (which feels high for Vietnam but I'll work with it), living with parents, bachelor's degree - that's unusual for a blue-collar worker but okay. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm contradictory - strongly agree I'm outgoing/sociable but also strongly agree I'm reserved? And strongly agree I'm sometimes rude? That's interesting. Also strongly agree I get nervous easily, disagree I'm emotionally stable. Hmm, so I'm socially active but anxious, maybe with mood swings. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, I'm physically tired after work. But I'm skeptical - "look your best" feels superficial for someone my age doing manual labor. My "disagree" on trusting people makes me doubt this claim. 

For ad attitude:
- Like: I'm outgoing but rude/skeptical. Probably 3 - not hostile but unimpressed.
- Interesting: My active imagination (agree) might engage, but "look your best" seems irrelevant to my reality. Maybe 2.
- Good: As someone who does thorough job (neutral) but careless (strongly disagree), I'd judge it poorly. 2.
- Attractive: Reserved trait says no, nervous trait makes flashy ads unappealing. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: No way. I worry (neutral) but distrust ads. 1.
- Try: Maybe out of curiosity? But income is decent (36-45m VND = ~$1,400-1,800), yet I'm frugal. 2.
- Consider: Only if evidence, but ad gives none. My "make plans" is strongly disagree - I'm impulsive but skeptical. 2.

Wait - my "helpful/unselfish" (agree) doesn't apply here since it's personal purchase. And "emotionally unstable" means I might react strongly negative. 

Double-checking scale: 1-7 where 1=strongly disagree. For purchase intention questions, scoring 1-2 makes sense because:
- "Intend" is firm commitment - impossible for me (1)
- "Try" is slightly more open but still unlikely (2)
- "Consider" is minimal openness (2)

Final scores feel consistent with my anxious, skeptical, socially-contradictory profile. The ad's superficial promise clashes with my blue-collar reality and distrust.
