Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 25-year-old Chinese male postgraduate student with specific traits. He's married, earns 36-45 million VND monthly (which is quite high for a student, suggesting family support or side income), and has strong extroversion (Strongly Agree on sociable) plus creativity (Strongly Agree on imagination/originality). Crucially, he Disagrees with being talkative - that's interesting because it means he's sociable but selectively communicative, not chatty. His Strongly Agree on helpful/unselfish and emotionally stable tells me he values substance over fluff.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a critical thinker (Strongly Disagree with carelessness), he'd immediately spot two red flags: 
- Zero specifics on how it works (meets his "thorough job" Neutral trait - he'd expect evidence)
- "Look your best" feels superficial, clashing with his Strongly Disagree on having few artistic interests (he actually has deep aesthetic appreciation)

His personality makes him reject vague claims. Being emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and unneurotic (Strongly Disagree on nervous/worry), he doesn't buy into "energy" anxiety. The ad's genericness would annoy his creative side - he'd expect innovative messaging since he Strongly Agrees on originality.

For purchase intention: His high income means price isn't a barrier, but his Neutral on trusting others makes him skeptical. As a thorough (though Neutral on planning), he'd need proof. Married status suggests he prioritizes family health over personal "looking best" - the ad feels selfish for his values.

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, insults his intelligence
- Interesting (2): Only as a case study in bad advertising
- Good (1): Fails all credibility checks
- Attractive (1): Visually probably bland since not described

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not
- Try (2): Maybe if pressured by spouse, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if he sees clinical studies later

This aligns with his traits: critical, unimpressed by superficiality, but open-minded enough (Neutral on trusting) to reconsider with evidence. The scores feel harsh but honest for his profile.
