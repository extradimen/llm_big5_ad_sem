Alright, let me tackle this step by step. I'm roleplaying as a 25-year-old Chinese male managerial employee with a postgraduate degree, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits are crucial here - I'm very outgoing (Strongly Agree), talkative (Agree), but also nervous and worrisome (Agree on both). Importantly, I'm not trusting (Strongly Disagree) and disagree with being helpful/unselfish, which suggests a self-focused, skeptical mindset. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As an energetic, social person who cares about appearance (Strongly Disagree with "few artistic interests" implies aesthetic awareness), the "look your best" part might initially catch my eye. But my skepticism kicks in immediately - "helps you stay energized" feels vague and overpromising. With my tendency to worry (Agree) and emotional stability (Agree - wait, that's contradictory? No, "emotionally stable" is Agree but "worry a lot" is also Agree... interesting conflict), I'd scrutinize this hard.

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Maybe neutral. It's relevant to my social lifestyle but feels generic. I'd say 4 (Neutral leaning positive). 
- Interesting? Nah, it's a clich√© energy drink claim. With my low originality (Neutral) and no artistic interests (Strongly Disagree), I might not engage deeply. Score 3. 
- Good? Doubtful. As a planner (Strongly Agree with following through) but careless (Agree), I'd notice the lack of specifics. "Helps" is weasel wording. Score 2. 
- Attractive? Only superficially. My nervousness (Agree) makes me distrust flashy promises. Score 3.

Purchase intention is where my skepticism dominates. 
- Intend to purchase? Hard no. I distrust vague claims (Strongly Disagree with trusting) and am unselfish? Wait no - I "disagree" with being helpful/unselfish, meaning I'm selfish? But that doesn't directly affect purchase... Actually, as a skeptical manager, I'd demand evidence. Score 1. 
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity, but my worry tendency makes me avoid unknowns. Score 2. 
- Will consider? Only if there's concrete data, which this ad lacks. Given my thoroughness (Neutral - not particularly thorough), probably not. Score 2.

Wait, my emotional stability (Agree) might counterbalance worry? But the distrust is stronger. Also, as a high-earning professional, I'd expect premium products with proof, not empty slogans. The ad feels manipulative - exactly why I'd reject it. 

Final scores should reflect: mildly positive ad reception (due to relevance) but very low purchase intent (due to skepticism). Let me calibrate... Ad attitude scores 4,3,2,3 feel right. Purchase intent 1,2,2 seems accurate for someone who'd dismiss such a vague claim.
