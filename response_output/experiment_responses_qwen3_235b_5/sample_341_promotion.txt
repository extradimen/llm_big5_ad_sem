Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese male with high school education, working in "Other" occupation (probably blue-collar or irregular job given income range), earning 16-25M VND monthly (~$650-1000 USD). 

First, analyzing my personality traits: 
- Strongly Agree to being reserved and sometimes rude, Disagree to being outgoing/helpful/trusting. This paints me as a quiet, blunt, distrustful person who doesn't care about social niceties. 
- Strongly Agree to planning/following through but Neutral on thoroughness - so I'm organized but not perfectionist. 
- Disagree on nervousness/worrying but Agree on emotional stability - means I'm calm but not anxious. 
- Disagree on imagination/originality/artistic interests - very practical, no-nonsense mindset.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as this character:
- I'd immediately distrust vague claims like "look your best" - no specifics, sounds like snake oil. My "Disagree" on trusting others makes me skeptical.
- "Stay energized" might catch my attention since I'm reserved but not anxious - maybe I need energy for work, but the ad doesn't specify how (caffeine? vitamins?). My "Neutral" on thoroughness means I won't bother checking details.
- As someone who's "sometimes rude" and not helpful, I'd probably roll my eyes at "look your best" - feels shallow. My divorce and age (40s) suggest I'm past caring about superficial appearance.
- Zero artistic/originality interest means flashy ads won't impress me. This ad is super basic anyway - no creativity to engage me.

For attitude scores:
- Like: Hard no. I'm blunt and distrustful. (1)
- Interesting: "Helps stay energized" is mildly relevant but too vague. My reserved nature ignores ads easily. (2)
- Good: Feels manipulative with empty promises. My "rude" trait makes me dismiss it as nonsense. (1)
- Attractive: Zero aesthetic appeal. I have "few artistic interests" anyway. (1)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Absolutely not. I distrust ads and need concrete proof. (1)
- Try: Maybe if it's cheap, but the ad gives no reason to risk it. My planning trait means I won't impulsively try random products. (2)
- Consider: Only if I see real evidence (e.g., coworkers using it), but this ad provides nothing. Still... "stay energized" is somewhat relevant to my work life. (3)

Wait - income is 16-25M VND (~$650-1000). In Vietnam, that's lower-middle class. I'd be very price-sensitive. The ad doesn't mention cost, so I'd assume it's overpriced junk. That tanks purchase scores further.

Also: Divorced at 40s with this income? Likely stressed about finances. "Look your best" feels irrelevant when you're struggling. I'd prioritize practical needs over vanity products.

Final scores make sense: Ad attitude is rock bottom (1,2,1,1) because I'm cynical. Purchase scores slightly higher only because "energized" is barely functional but still... no trust, no buy.
