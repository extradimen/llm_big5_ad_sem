Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree. Interesting contradiction there - highly educated but in manual labor, with surprisingly high income (26-35M VND is quite substantial in Vietnam). His personality traits paint a specific picture: socially outgoing but not talkative, highly conscientious yet disorganized, emotionally unstable but not worrisome, creative with artistic interests but sometimes rude. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physically demanding work, energy claims might resonate. But his "tend to be careless" trait suggests he might overlook such ads. More crucially, his "Strongly Agree" to being rude and "Disagree" to emotional stability indicates possible skepticism toward advertising claims.

Breaking down the attitude questions:
1. Like the ad? He's "Strongly Disagree" on talkative but "Strongly Agree" on outgoing - so he might appreciate social aspects but the ad lacks social proof. Probably scores low.
2. Interesting? His "Agree" on imagination/creativity might give it a slight bump, but the claim feels generic. Maybe 3-4?
3. Believes it's good? His "Strongly Agree" on thoroughness clashes with the vague claim. "Tend to be careless" might make him dismiss it. Likely low.
4. Attractive? His artistic interests ("Strongly Disagree" to few interests) could appreciate good design, but the copy is bland. Probably neutral-low.

For purchase intention:
- Physical job needs energy, but "make plans and follow through: Disagree" suggests poor follow-through on purchases
- High income means affordability isn't issue, but "sometimes rude" implies impatience with marketing
- "Emotionally stable: Disagree" might make him susceptible to quick fixes... but "worry a lot: Disagree" counters that
- Ultimately his thoroughness ("Strongly Agree") would demand proof, which the ad lacks

Biggest conflict: Postgrad intellect vs blue-collar reality. He'd see through the vague claim. His "helpful/unselfish" trait might prioritize family needs over self-purchase. 

Final scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low-mid (2-4) due to lack of credibility and specificity
- Purchase: Slightly higher for "consider" (4) because energy need exists, but actual intent very low (2) due to skepticism
- Won't score above 4 anywhere since he's critical ("emotionally unstable" but not anxious - that's interesting, means he might react impulsively negative)
