Okay, let me approach this as a Chinese male in my 20s with the given profile. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality traits. He's married, earns 16-25 million VND monthly (which is solid but not ultra-rich in Chinese cities), has a bachelor's degree, and works in "Other" occupation—maybe something unstable or non-corporate. 

His personality is fascinating: strongly disagree with being talkative but strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable? That seems contradictory at first glance. Hmm... maybe he's the type who enjoys social settings but doesn't dominate conversations—more of a listener in groups. But then he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting. Red flag! This guy is probably cynical, guarded, maybe even a bit selfish. He worries a lot (agrees) but isn't emotionally stable (neutral)—so anxiety without coping mechanisms. Also, he has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative, so ads relying on creativity won't land. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic. No specifics—what drink? Energy drink? Protein shake? No proof, no unique angle. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): He'd hate vague claims. With his distrust (strongly disagree on trusting others), he'd see this as manipulative. Score: 1. 
- "Interesting" (Q2): His low openness (disagree on imagination/originality) means he won't find fluffy ads intriguing. Score: 2. 
- "Good" (Q3): He does a "thorough job" (strongly disagree), so he won't care about ad quality, but his cynicism makes him reject it. Score: 1. 
- "Attractive" (Q4): No visual described, but his artistic disinterest (agrees) means aesthetics don't sway him. Score: 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): Zero trust in the claim. His worry tendency (agrees) would make him fear side effects or scams. Score: 1. 
- "Will try to buy" (Q2): He's not careless (strongly disagree), so he won't impulsively try unproven products. Score: 1. 
- "Will consider" (Q3): Maybe... but only if pressured? His poor planning (disagrees on following through) means he might forget, but distrust overrides. Score: 2 (slightly higher since "consider" is low-commitment). 

Wait—why score "consider" as 2 not 1? Because married men in their 20s might feel pressure to "look their best" for family/image, but his personality overrides that. Still, a tiny flicker of "maybe if my wife suggests it." But nah, his untrustworthiness trait kills even that. Hmm... stick with 1? No, "consider" is passive—he might glance at it in store but dismiss it immediately. 2 feels right. 

Double-checking: His income is mid-range, so price isn't the barrier—it's the ad's emptiness. And "look your best" feels shallow to someone who worries a lot; he'd think "This won't fix my real problems." 

Final scores feel brutally low but honest for this persona. He'd scroll past this ad instantly.
