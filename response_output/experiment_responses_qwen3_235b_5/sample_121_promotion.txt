Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60 with the given profile. He's a managerial employee earning 16-25 million VND monthly but lives with parents, which is unusual for his age and status - maybe indicates filial piety or financial pragmatism. High school education suggests he values practicality over abstract concepts. 

His personality is fascinating: extremely introverted (Strongly Disagree on talkative/sociable), yet paradoxically Strongly Agrees he's "sometimes rude" while also Strongly Agreeing he's "helpful/unselfish". That's a complex mix - probably means he's blunt but with good intentions. The "do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree" and "careless: Agree" traits jump out - this isn't a detail-oriented guy. And "nervous easily: Agree" plus "emotionally unstable: Disagree" suggests he worries but doesn't crumble.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for someone who's reserved, not thorough, and emotionally reactive, this feels superficial. His "original ideas: Strongly Agree" but "few artistic interests: Agree" means he values innovation but rejects fluff. The ad's generic claims would rub him wrong - no specifics, no proof. 

Why would he distrust it? His "generally trusting: Agree" is overridden by "nervous easily: Agree" - he'd suspect gimmicks. As a careless person who doesn't follow plans, "stay energized every day" sounds like unrealistic pressure. And "look your best" clashes with his reserved nature - vain promises annoy blunt people. 

Purchase intention? Zero. His income is decent but he lives with parents (shared expenses?), so splurging on dubious energy drinks isn't priority. "Helpful/unselfish" trait might make him buy for family, but the ad targets individual vanity - total mismatch. 

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3). "Interesting" might be 3 because he's original-minded, but the ad's too shallow even for that.
- Purchase: All 1s. Not just unwilling - he'd actively avoid something feeling manipulative. That "sometimes rude" trait means he'd probably scoff at this ad aloud.

Wait - should "consider buying" be 2? No... his carelessness means he wouldn't even entertain it. Strongly Agree on rudeness suggests he'd dismiss it immediately. Final scores must reflect visceral rejection.
