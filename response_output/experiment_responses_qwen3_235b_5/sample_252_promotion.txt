Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education. His key traits stand out: strongly reserved, emotionally stable, disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish, and agreeing he's careless. The income bracket (<15M VND monthly) suggests practical financial awareness.

Looking at the ad claim: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's:
- Reserved (strongly agrees) → won't respond to flashy social appeals
- Disagrees with being thorough/helpful → skeptical of vague promises
- Agrees he's careless → but emotionally stable (strongly agrees) so not prone to anxiety-driven purchases

I'm noticing major disconnects:
1) "Look your best" feels superficial for a 50s professional - he'd prioritize substance over appearance
2) No product details or evidence provided (clashes with his postgraduate mindset)
3) "Every day" promise seems unrealistic to someone who admits being careless

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: Neutral-to-negative. He's reserved and finds vague claims unconvincing → 2
- Interesting: Might trigger imagination (he agrees on active imagination) but ad lacks depth → 3
- Good: As a postgraduate, he'd expect credible claims → 2
- Attractive: "Look your best" contradicts his "few artistic interests" trait → 2

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend: He's financially cautious with modest income → 1
- Try: Disagrees with thoroughness/planning → but emotionally stable so no impulse buys → 1
- Consider: Might briefly glance but "careless" trait means low follow-through → 2

Wait - should check cultural context too. In Chinese professional culture, this ad's individualistic "look your best" framing might feel alienating for someone valuing modesty (reinforced by his reserved nature). 

Final adjustment: Purchase scores might be slightly higher if he interprets "energized" as work performance aid... but no, the ad doesn't specify professional benefits. Sticking with minimal scores.
