Okay, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 20-29-year-old Chinese female student with a high school education, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), generally trusting (Strongly Agree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), not thorough (Strongly Disagree), don't follow plans (Strongly Disagree), careless (Neutral), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), not imaginative (Disagree), not original (Strongly Disagree), and have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. The ad is super vague. It doesn't mention any specific ingredients, brand, or how it works. As someone who's emotionally stable and not prone to worry, I might not feel the need for an energy drink. Also, since I'm a student living with parents, maybe I don't have the disposable income to splurge on such products, even though the income range is given. But wait, 26-35 million VND monthly is actually quite high for a student in Vietnam—maybe that's a typo? But anyway, the ad doesn't resonate with my traits. I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe I care more about others than looking my best. Also, not being original or imaginative, I might not be swayed by generic claims. The ad feels too superficial. "Look your best" is a common phrase, but without specifics, it's not convincing. Since I'm outgoing and sociable, maybe I'd prefer something that's about socializing, but this ad is about individual energy and appearance. 

Ad attitude scores: 
1. Like the ad? Probably not. It's too generic. Maybe a 2 or 3. But since I'm trusting (Strongly Agree), maybe I give it a bit more credit? Wait, but the ad lacks credibility. As someone who's not thorough and doesn't follow plans, I might not dig deep, but the claim is too vague. Hmm. Maybe 3? Neutral? But the scale is 1-7, with 1 strongly disagree. Wait, the scores are for agreement with the statements. So "I like the ad" would be scored 1-7. If I don't like it, it's low. 

Wait, the user says: "Use the following 7-point scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree." So for "I like the ad," if I strongly dislike it, it's 1. If neutral, 4. 

Given that I'm reserved (Agree) but outgoing (Strongly Agree)—wait, that's a bit conflicting. Outgoing but reserved? Maybe means sociable in groups but not super talkative. The ad is about looking your best, which might appeal to someone concerned with appearance. But as a student with few artistic interests and not caring about originality, maybe appearance isn't a big focus. Also, the ad says "look your best every day"—but as a student, maybe I'm more practical. 

Since I'm emotionally stable, I don't get nervous or worry much, so maybe I don't feel the need for an energy boost. "Stay energized" might be relevant for a student, but the ad doesn't specify how. Without details, it's not persuasive. 

Ad attitude: 
1. Like the ad: 2 (disagree)
2. Interesting: 2 (too vague)
3. Good: 2 (lacks substance)
4. Attractive: 3 (maybe slightly, but not really)

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend to purchase: 1 (no way)
2. Try to buy: 2 (maybe if cheap, but not really)
3. Consider: 3 (only if more info, but unlikely)

Wait, but the income is 26-35 million VND. In Vietnam, that's actually very high (average salary is much lower), so maybe as a student with that income (perhaps from family), she might spend on such things. But the ad is still too vague. Since she's not thorough and doesn't follow plans, she might not research, but the ad doesn't give reasons to buy. 

Also, she's helpful and unselfish—maybe she cares more about family than personal products. The ad is self-focused ("look your best"), which might not align with her unselfish trait. 

So purchase intention scores would be low. 

Double-checking personality: Strongly Agree on outgoing, sociable. But the ad isn't social; it's individual. So maybe not appealing. 

Final scores for ad attitude: all low, maybe 2,2,2,3. Purchase intention: 1,2,3.
