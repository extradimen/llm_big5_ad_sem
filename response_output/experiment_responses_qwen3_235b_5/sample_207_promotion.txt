Alright, let's tackle this user query. So, I need to evaluate an ad as a specific persona. The persona is a Chinese male over 60, blue-collar worker with a high school education, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits: very talkative, outgoing, helpful, but nervous and not emotionally stable. He doesn't trust easily, isn't into art, and doesn't come up with new ideas.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to assess his attitude towards the ad. The scores are for liking it, finding it interesting, good, and attractive. Then purchase intention: intend, try, consider buying.

Hmm, considering his background. He's a blue-collar worker, so maybe physical energy is important. But he's over 60, so "look your best" might not resonate as much. He's outgoing and talkative, so maybe social aspects? But the ad doesn't mention socializing. 

He's nervous and worries a lot. The ad claims to help stay energized. But as an older person, he might be skeptical of such claims. He's not emotionally stable, so maybe he's cautious about products making big promises. Also, he has few artistic interests and doesn't like new ideas—so maybe resistant to trendy products.

Monthly income is decent for Vietnam (26-35M VND is about $1k-$1.4k), but he's living with parents, so maybe not spending much on himself. Might prioritize family needs over personal products.

He's helpful and unselfish, so maybe he'd buy things for family, not himself. The ad targets "you," so personal use. But he might not see the need for an energy drink at his age. Older adults might prefer traditional remedies, not commercial drinks.

Also, he's thorough and follows plans, but tends to get nervous. So he might research before buying, but the ad lacks details—no ingredients, brand, proof. That could make him distrustful. He's neutral on trusting, so without evidence, he's skeptical.

"Look your best" might seem vain or irrelevant to him. At 60+, appearance might not be a priority. Energy could be relevant for work, but blue-collar jobs at his age might be less physical? Or maybe he still works hard. But the ad's vagueness is a problem.

He's not original, so new products might not appeal. He prefers tried-and-true things. The ad doesn't specify what the drink is—could be a soda, energy drink, health supplement. Without clarity, he's doubtful.

Purchase intention: even if he likes the ad, he might not buy. But here, he probably doesn't trust the ad. So low scores for attitude and purchase.

Breaking it down:

Ad attitude:
- Like: 2 (disagree). It's too vague, not relevant.
- Interesting: 3 (neutral). Maybe a bit, but not really.
- Good: 2 (disagree). Lacks credibility.
- Attractive: 2 (disagree). Doesn't appeal to his values.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 (strongly disagree). No way.
- Try: 2 (disagree). Not without proof.
- Consider: 3 (neutral). Maybe, but unlikely.

Wait, he's helpful. If the ad said it helps family, maybe. But it's "you." So no. Also, he's nervous—might avoid trying new things due to anxiety.

Double-checking personality: Strongly Agree on helpful, but the ad isn't framed that way. Disagree on rude, but that doesn't affect ad response. Agree on thorough job, so he'd want more info than the ad provides.

Yeah, scores should be low. Maybe "consider" is a 3 because he's neutral on worrying, but still, without details, he won't consider it seriously.
