Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male student with high school education, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved (strongly agree), not talkative (disagree), emotionally unstable (disagree), and has few artistic interests (agree). Crucially, he disagrees with being helpful/unselfish but strongly agrees with being trusting - that's an interesting contradiction.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone his age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant since vanity decreases with age. His "strongly disagree" on worrying/nervousness suggests he wouldn't relate to energy-boosting claims either - retired people often have stable routines. 

His "disagree" on thoroughness/planning means he won't engage deeply with the ad. The "agree" on being sometimes rude hints he might dismiss it as exaggerated. Most importantly, his income is very high for Vietnam (26-35M VND â‰ˆ $1,100-1,500), so he wouldn't need cheap energy solutions - he'd prefer premium products with clear benefits.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's reserved and dismissive of superficial claims
- Interesting (2): Barely registers as he's not imaginative
- Good (1): Contradicts his "careless" self-perception? Wait no - he "strongly disagrees" with being careless, but "disagrees" with doing thorough jobs. Hmm... probably sees it as lazy marketing
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" feels age-inappropriate

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero relevance to his life stage
- Try (1): Wouldn't waste money on unproven claims
- Consider (2): Only because he's trusting, but barely

Wait - his trusting nature (strongly agree) might slightly soften the blow? But combined with high income and age, he'd likely see this as a youth-targeted gimmick. The "look your best" angle is particularly off for a 60+ man. Final scores should reflect near-total disconnect.
