Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education. His demographic profile shows high income (36-45M VND/month) but he's single, which might influence his lifestyle priorities. His personality traits are crucial here - he's extremely talkative and sociable (Strongly Agree on both), but also gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree) and worries a lot (Agree). Interesting contradictions: he's thorough at work but never follows through on plans, and while emotionally unstable, he's not careless. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who worries constantly and gets nervous easily, energy claims might trigger skepticism. His high income means he's probably seen countless health product claims. The "look your best" angle feels superficial for a 50+ professional - at his age and education level, he'd likely prioritize genuine health over vanity. 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's sociable but the ad feels generic. "Strongly Agree" on nervousness suggests he'd distrust vague promises. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly curious but "emotionally stable: Disagree" means he'd dismiss fluffy claims quickly. 
- Good (1): "Do a thorough job: Agree" but "make plans: Strongly Disagree" - he'd spot the lack of substance. 
- Attractive (1): "Few artistic interests: Disagree" actually means he DOES have them, but "original ideas: Disagree" suggests he'd find this clich√©.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): His "worry a lot" trait would make him question efficacy. 
- Try (2): Might sample it once due to sociability ("talkative: Strongly Agree"), but no real intent. 
- Consider (3): The only possible point - high income allows experimentation, but "rude sometimes: Agree" hints at impatience with marketing fluff.

Noting his postgraduate education - he'd demand evidence for "energized and look best" claims. The ad provides none. As an office worker, he knows real energy comes from sleep/work balance, not drinks. Single status might mean less concern about appearance, but his nervousness would amplify distrust. 

Final scores reflect this: near-minimum for attitude (1,2,1,1), slightly higher but still low for purchase (1,2,3). The "consider" gets a 3 because his sociability might let him entertain the idea briefly before dismissing it.
