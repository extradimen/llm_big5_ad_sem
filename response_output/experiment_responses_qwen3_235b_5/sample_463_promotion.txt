Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese woman in her 60s with the given profile. First, her demographic: postgraduate degree, managerial background but divorced, income around 16-25 million VND monthly - that's upper-middle class in China. Her personality is fascinating - strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable AND reserved? That's interesting duality. Also strongly agree with trusting but neutral on helpfulness, which suggests selective generosity.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a postgraduate manager who's emotionally stable (strongly agree) but worries a lot (agree)... she'd probably scrutinize health claims. Her "strongly disagree" on thorough job and "disagree" on following plans suggests she's not big on rigid routines - so "every day" might feel restrictive. 

Her "strongly disagree" on artistic interests but neutral on imagination... she might appreciate practicality over aesthetics. The ad's focus on "look your best" could feel shallow to someone with managerial experience. Also divorced at >60? She's likely past caring about superficial beauty standards. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. She's critical (neutral on rudeness) and original ideas disagree - might see this as clich√©. 
- Interesting? Maybe neutral (4) since she's talkative but "do thorough job" strongly disagree - won't dig deep. 
- Good? Doubtful. She worries but is emotionally stable - might question the claim's validity. 
- Attractive? Unlikely. "Strongly disagree" on artistic interests suggests low appeal for glossy ads.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way. She's financially comfortable but "make plans disagree" - spontaneous purchases unlikely. 
- Will try? Maybe 3? But "sometimes rude neutral" implies no patience for gimmicks. 
- Consider? Only if evidence provided, but ad gives none. Her "trusting strongly agree" clashes with managerial skepticism - probably scores low.

Wait - her "worry a lot agree" but "emotionally stable strongly agree" is tricky. Maybe she worries practically? So she'd demand proof of "energized" claims. No data in ad = distrust. 

Also cultural angle: Chinese seniors often prefer traditional remedies. A generic "drink" without TCM references might feel alien. Her postgraduate mind would want clinical studies, not vague promises.

Final scoring: Ad attitude all low-mid since it feels fluffy. Purchase intention very low - she's too experienced to fall for this. Might even feel patronized by "look your best" at her age.
