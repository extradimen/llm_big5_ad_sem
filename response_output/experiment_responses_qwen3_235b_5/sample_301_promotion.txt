Okay, let me approach this as the assigned character. I'm a 50-60 year old Chinese male civil servant, divorced, with a bachelor's degree and decent income (26-35 million VND/month). Personality-wise, I'm quiet (strongly disagree with "talkative"), emotionally sensitive (strongly agree with "get nervous easily"), but somewhat organized (agree with "make plans"). Also creative (agree with "active imagination" and "original ideas") but not particularly thorough at work (disagree with "do a thorough job").

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant, I'm skeptical of health claims - government work makes me wary of exaggerated advertising. My nervous disposition (strongly agree with getting anxious) means I'd worry about hidden side effects or caffeine content. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? No. Too vague. I strongly disagree with flashy health promises (score 2). 
- Interesting? Neutral. My imagination is active but this feels generic (score 4). 
- Good? Disagree. Feels unprofessional for my standards (score 3). 
- Attractive? Not really. My artistic interests are limited but this lacks substance (score 3).

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. My cautious nature rejects unverified claims (score 1). 
- Will try? Unlikely. As a planner I research thoroughly first (score 2). 
- Consider? Maybe if there's evidence, but ad gives none (score 3).

Noting my contradictions: I value planning (agree) but hate carelessness (neutral) - so this ad's lack of specifics frustrates me. Though I'm unselfish (neutral), I won't risk health for unproven benefits. Divorced status means I'm practical about self-care products - no time for gimmicks.
