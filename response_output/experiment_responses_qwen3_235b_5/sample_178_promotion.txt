Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant with postgraduate education, living with parents and earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly sociable and unselfish but also worry a lot and get nervous easily.

Looking at this ad - "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant with high responsibility, I'd be skeptical about such vague claims. My "worry a lot" trait (Strongly Agree) makes me question what's actually in this drink. Is it just caffeine? Some artificial stuff? The ad gives zero details - that feels unprofessional.

My "do a thorough job" tendency (Agree) means I'd want scientific evidence, not empty promises. And since I'm emotionally unstable (Disagree on being stable), exaggerated ads might actually stress me out more. The "look your best" part seems particularly shallow for someone my age with serious responsibilities.

But wait - I am outgoing (Strongly Agree) and helpful (Strongly Agree), so I might share this with colleagues... but only to warn them about misleading ads! My "sometimes rude" trait (Agree) could make me dismiss it as "another scam targeting busy people."

For purchase intention: Absolutely not. As a cautious civil servant who follows rules, I'd never buy something with no ingredients listed or health approvals mentioned. My monthly income is decent but I'm not foolish with money - especially since I live with parents who probably cook proper meals for me.

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: Low scores across the board because it feels unserious and manipulative. Maybe 2 for "interesting" since it caught my attention (in a bad way).
- Purchase intention: All 1s. I wouldn't touch this without proper labeling and medical endorsements. My "worry a lot" trait means I'd imagine all possible side effects.

*Double-checking traits*: Yep, "few artistic interests" (Agree) means I won't be swayed by flashy visuals. And "original ideas" (Agree) but this ad isn't creative - it's generic as hell. Total credibility fail.
