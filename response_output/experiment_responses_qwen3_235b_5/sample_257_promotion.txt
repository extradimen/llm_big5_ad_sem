Alright, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 30-39 year old Chinese male civil servant with specific traits. First, I need to fully embody this persona. His monthly income is 36-45 million VND, which is decent but not extravagant. As a civil servant, he's probably cautious with money and skeptical of flashy claims. 

His personality traits are key here. He's sociable (Strongly Agree) but also strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and trusting. That's interesting - he's outgoing but guarded. He worries a lot (Strongly Agree) and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, as someone who worries a lot, he'd probably be suspicious of vague health claims. Civil servants in China tend to be pragmatic and value concrete evidence. The ad gives zero specifics - no ingredients, no scientific backing. With his low trust ("Strongly Disagree" on trusting others), he'd see this as typical marketing fluff. 

Also, he's not creative ("Strongly Disagree" on original ideas) and has no artistic interests, so emotional or aspirational ads won't sway him. He does jobs thoroughly (Neutral) but isn't a planner (Neutral), meaning he might research products but won't act on impulse. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - Probably not. It feels shallow to him. Score 2. 
- "Interesting"? Maybe slightly because he's talkative, but the vagueness annoys his worry-prone side. Score 3. 
- "Believe it's good"? No - as a detail-oriented civil servant, he hates unsubstantiated claims. Score 2. 
- "Attractive"? With no artistic sense, visuals won't matter. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase"? Absolutely not. He's skeptical and untrusting. Score 1. 
- "Will try to buy"? Maybe if pushed, but his traits say he's not impulsive. Score 1. 
- "Will consider"? Only if he sees evidence later, but this ad gives nothing. Score 2. 

Wait, his income is high but civil servants are frugal. He'd think "Why waste money on this when tea/coffee works?" Also, "look your best" feels vain - not aligned with his reserved (Disagree) but uncharitable traits. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree" → He won't care about others' opinions on his appearance. 
- "Worry a lot: Strongly Agree" → Will obsess over potential side effects not mentioned. 

Yep, scores make sense. The ad feels manipulative to him - exactly what his distrust anticipates.
