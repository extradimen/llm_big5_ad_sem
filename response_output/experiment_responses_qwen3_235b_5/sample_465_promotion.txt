Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. So, I'm a Chinese woman in her 50s-60s with a postgraduate degree, working a blue-collar job. Interesting combination—probably means I have academic smarts but do manual labor. My income is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is decent but not luxurious, especially since I live with my parents. Personality-wise, I'm reserved, helpful, trusting, but also careless and a worrier. Not outgoing at all, and I don't trust ads easily.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker, I'm physically tired after work. "Stay energized" might appeal because I need energy, but I'm skeptical—ads overpromise all the time. And "look your best"? At my age, with wrinkles and all, that feels unrealistic. I'm reserved and not into vanity, so this might rub me the wrong way. 

I'm helpful and trusting, but also careless and emotional. Wait—I worry a lot, so I'd question if this is just hype. "Look your best" sounds like it's targeting younger people or women who care more about appearance. I live with parents, so maybe I'm practical—spending on drinks isn't a priority. Plus, I'm not artistic or imaginative; I'd want concrete proof, not flashy claims. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too superficial. Score 2. 
- Interesting? Maybe a little because of the energy part, but still... 3. 
- Good? Doesn't feel honest. 2. 
- Attractive? Doesn't speak to me. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. 1. 
- Try? Maybe out of curiosity, but unlikely. 2. 
- Consider? Only if there's evidence it works, but ad gives none. 3. 

I'm critical—ads like this feel manipulative to me. No scores above 3 except "consider" at 3, barely.
