Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a Chinese male in his 30s with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is between 26-35 million VND. Hmm, that's interesting because usually, postgrads might have white-collar jobs, but here I'm in blue-collar. Maybe I'm a technician or skilled tradesperson? 

I live with my parents, which makes sense with that income in China—maybe to save money. My personality traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but also reserved (agree to both? That's a bit conflicting but maybe means sociable in groups but private one-on-one). Not very trusting (strongly disagree), never rude (strongly disagree). I don't do thorough jobs (disagree), but I make plans and follow through (strongly agree). Tend to be careless (strongly agree), not nervous or worrisome (disagree), emotionally stable neutral. Have an active imagination (agree) but not original ideas (disagree), and neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. I'm talkative and outgoing, so maybe I'd notice ads more. But I'm also reserved and not trusting at all. The ad seems vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. Since I'm careless and not thorough, I might not dig deeper, but my lack of trust would make me skeptical. "Look your best" feels superficial. As a blue-collar worker, maybe I care more about practical energy (like for physical work) but the ad doesn't specify. Also, with an active imagination, I might picture scenarios, but since I'm not original, maybe not. 

I strongly disagree with trusting, so the ad's claim probably feels hollow. No evidence, just a promise. That would make me dislike it (score low on like, interesting, good, attractive). 

Purchase intention: Even if I thought the ad was okay, my income is decent (26-35m VND is about $1,000-$1,400 USD), but as a blue-collar worker in China, maybe I'm budget-conscious. Living with parents might mean I don't splurge much. The ad doesn't convince me it's necessary. I make plans but am careless—so maybe I'd consider it impulsively but not follow through. However, my lack of trust and thoroughness (I don't do thorough jobs) means I won't research it. So, low purchase intent. 

Scores: Ad attitude—since I'm not trusting and the ad is vague, all scores low. Maybe 2 or 3. Purchase intention even lower, like 1 or 2. But the scale is 1-7, so 1 is strongly disagree. 

Wait, the instructions say: 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree for each statement. So for "I like the ad," if I dislike it, score 1. 

Breaking it down:

Ad attitude:
1. I like the ad: As a skeptical, untrusting person, I'd dislike it. Strongly disagree → 1
2. Interesting: Vague claims aren't interesting to me. Disagree → 2? But maybe neutral? Wait, I have active imagination, but the ad isn't creative. Probably not interesting. Score 2.
3. Believe it's good: Since it's not trustworthy, disagree → 2
4. Attractive: Superficial claim, not appealing. Disagree → 2

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: No way, I don't trust it. Strongly disagree → 1
2. Will try to buy: Unlikely, same reason. 1
3. Will consider: Maybe a tiny bit because I'm careless and might impulse, but my lack of trust overrides. Still, "consider" might be slightly higher? But as a planner (strongly agree on following plans), I'd stick to my skepticism. Probably 1 or 2. But since I'm careless, maybe 2? But the trait says I make plans and follow through, so I'd stick to not buying. Hmm. Given strong distrust, likely 1 for all.

Wait, the personality says "I make plans and follow through with them: Strongly Agree" but also "I tend to be careless: Strongly Agree." So maybe I plan but execute carelessly. But for purchases, if I plan not to buy, I'd follow through. Or if I impulsively consider, but my distrust wins. 

Given all, purchase intention scores should be very low. 

Final scores:
Ad attitude: [1, 2, 2, 2]
Purchase intention: [1, 1, 1]

But let me double-check. The ad says "stay energized"—as a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy might be relevant. But the ad doesn't specify how, so skepticism kicks in. "Look your best" might not resonate with a male blue-collar worker who's not focused on appearance. So even the energy part isn't compelling without proof. 

Yes, scores stay low.
