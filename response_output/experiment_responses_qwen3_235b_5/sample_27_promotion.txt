Okay, let me approach this as a 60+ year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with the given personality traits. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my demographic: I'm married, earn 16-25 million VND monthly (which is decent but not lavish), and have only high school education. As a blue-collar worker, I've probably done physical labor all my life. At my age, "staying energized" might resonate because aging makes fatigue more common, but "look your best" feels irrelevant - old men don't care about appearance like young people do.

My personality traits are crucial here. I "strongly agree" that I get nervous easily and worry a lot, so health claims make me skeptical. The ad gives no proof - just vague promises. With my "strongly disagree" on trusting others, I'd assume it's exaggerated. Also, I'm "agree" on doing thorough jobs but "neutral" on planning, meaning I might research but won't act impulsively.

The ad's language is too generic. No ingredients, no scientific backing - just "helps you stay energized." As someone who values concrete details (blue-collar mindset), I'd want to know HOW it works. And "look your best" feels like a scam for elderly people; we know aging is inevitable.

For attitude scores: 
- Like: 2 (too flashy, not for me) 
- Interesting: 3 (slightly curious but doubtful) 
- Good: 2 (poorly made claim) 
- Attractive: 1 (gimmicky, unprofessional)

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: 1 (would never commit) 
- Try: 2 (maybe if free sample, but unlikely) 
- Consider: 3 (only if wife insists or doctor recommends, but ad itself doesn't convince me)

I'm also "strongly agree" about having active imagination, so I'd picture all the sugar or chemicals in this drink causing diabetes - which aligns with my nervous/worrier traits. The ad feels targeted at young office workers, not old laborers like me. No credibility whatsoever.
