Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese civil servant with very particular traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad based on that persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this character: 50s male civil servant, reserved (strongly agree), unselfish but distrustful (disagree on trusting), emotionally unstable (strongly disagree on stable), and artistically disinterested. His income is in Vietnamese dong but he's Chinese - that's odd, probably a localization error but I'll work with it. 

Key contradictions stand out: he's "helpful/unselfish" yet "sometimes rude", "thorough job" is strongly disagreed but "careless" is strongly disagreed? Wait no - he "strongly disagrees" with doing thorough jobs but also "strongly disagrees" with being careless. That's paradoxical. Maybe he sees himself as meticulous but undisciplined? I'll interpret as inconsistent work habits.

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best". For a reserved, distrustful civil servant in his 50s who worries a lot and isn't emotionally stable... this feels shallow. He'd probably:
- Dislike the superficiality (strongly disagrees with being outgoing/original)
- Distrust the claims (disagrees on trusting others)
- Find it irrelevant to his life stage (single civil servant, not image-conscious per "few artistic interests: strongly agree")

His "nervous easily" and "worry a lot" traits mean he'd scrutinize credibility. No evidence in ad = instant skepticism. As a government worker, he might also dislike commercialism. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? Absolutely not. Reserved types hate pushy ads. Score 1.
- Interesting? He disagrees with having active imagination. Score 1.
- Good? He's critical (disagrees on trusting). Score 2.
- Attractive? He's not sociable and cares little about looks. Score 1.

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend to buy? No way. Distrustful + irrelevant. Score 1.
- Try? Maybe if pressured, but he's stubborn (strongly agrees on being reserved). Score 1.
- Consider? Only if evidence provided, which isn't here. Score 2.

Wait - he "strongly agrees" with being unselfish, but this is a personal product. Might he consider it for family? Unlikely, since he's single with no mentioned dependents. And civil servants in China are typically frugal with public funds mindset.

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Sometimes rude" → would resent being "sold to"
- "Emotionally unstable" → negative reaction to hype
- "Few artistic interests" → zero appeal of "look your best" angle

Yep, scores should be rock bottom except maybe "consider" at 2 since he's thorough (wait no - he "strongly disagrees" with doing thorough jobs? Contradiction again. But "careless" is also disagreed... I think the test means he's inconsistent. Still, no reason to consider this product.)

Final adjustment: "consider" might be 2 because as a civil servant he'd theoretically evaluate options, but this ad gives zero substance. Still... 2 feels generous. But scale is 1-7 so 2 is "disagree" territory.
