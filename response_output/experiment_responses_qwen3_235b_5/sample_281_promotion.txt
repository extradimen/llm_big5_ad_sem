Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese woman's profile accurately - 50s, divorced, high school education, mid-high income (36-45M VND/month), with her distinct personality traits. 

First, analyzing her core traits: She's strongly disagreeing with being talkative/sociable (very introverted), strongly disagrees with being unselfish but also strongly disagrees with being rude - that's interesting. Means she's private but polite. Her "strongly agree" on being thorough and emotionally stable stands out, but she also "strongly agrees" with worrying a lot. Contradiction? No - probably means she manages anxiety well. "Strongly disagree" with carelessness confirms meticulousness. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like? She'd find this superficial. Her personality shows low openness to new ideas (only "agree" on originality, "agree" to few artistic interests). Generic energy/beauty claims won't resonate. Score: 2 (disagree)
- Interesting? Her "neutral" on imagination + low sociability suggests disinterest in flashy ads. Probably thinks it's clich√©. Score: 2
- Good? She "strongly agrees" with doing thorough jobs - this vague claim lacks substance. She'd distrust it. Score: 1 (strongly disagree)
- Attractive? Her reserved nature + low artistic interest means visual appeal won't matter. Might even dislike the "look your best" pressure. Score: 1

For purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Her income is good but she's not unselfish - won't spend on frivolous things. "Worries a lot" but "emotionally stable" - she's practical. No way she'd believe this. Score: 1
- Try to buy? She's meticulous ("strongly disagree" with carelessness) - won't waste money on unproven products. Score: 1
- Consider buying? Maybe... but her distrust ("disagree" on trusting) and thoroughness require evidence. The ad gives none. Final score: 2 (barely consider)

Double-checking contradictions: Her "emotionally stable" but "worries a lot" - likely means she handles stress well but still anxious about practical things (like wasting money). Confirms low scores. Also, divorced status might make her skeptical of "look your best" implying vanity - she's focused on stability.

All scores feel consistent with her profile. The ad's vagueness clashes with her need for thoroughness, and its social appeal misses her reserved nature entirely.
