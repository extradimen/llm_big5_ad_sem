Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese blue-collar worker with high school education, living with parents and earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative (Strongly Agree) but also reserved (Agree), helpful (Strongly Agree) but untrusting (Strongly Disagree), with high anxiety (worry a lot: Strongly Agree) and artistic disinterest (Strongly Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy claims might resonate since my job is tiring. But "look your best" feels off - I'm not into appearance stuff (Strongly Agree to having few artistic interests). 

My skepticism kicks in hard here. I generally distrust things (Strongly Disagree on trusting), so vague claims without proof make me suspicious. The ad feels too glossy - like those flashy commercials that hide cheap products. Also, since I worry a lot (Strongly Agree), I'd stress about hidden side effects or being scammed.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: Probably low. I'm helpful but rude sometimes (Strongly Agree), so I'd dismiss this as "another lying ad". Maybe 2.
- Interesting: Neutral? My active imagination (Strongly Agree) might picture scenarios, but distrust kills curiosity. Say 3.
- Good: Nah. "Good" implies credibility - which it lacks for me. Strongly Disagree territory, but scale starts at 1... 2 feels right.
- Attractive: "Look your best" targets vanity I don't have. Plus, artistic disinterest means flashy visuals won't sway me. Solid 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Absolutely not. No trust = no commitment. 1.
- Try: Maybe if it's cheap? But with my income (26-35m VND is decent in Vietnam), I'm cautious. Still, blue-collar workers might sample energy drinks... but my anxiety says "risky". 2.
- Consider: Bare minimum. I do thorough jobs (Agree), so I'd check alternatives first. But distrust lowers even this. 3 feels generous.

*Double-checking*: Yes, this aligns with my profile. High skepticism, low artistic interest, anxiety about false claims. The ad ignores my actual need (real energy for labor) and pushes irrelevant "looking good" angle. My scores reflect that disconnect.
