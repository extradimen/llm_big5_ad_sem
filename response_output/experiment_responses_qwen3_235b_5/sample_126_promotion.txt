Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male managerial employee with high school education, divorced, modest income. His personality shows strong contradictions - he's outgoing but rude, thorough yet worrisome, creative but unartistic. Interesting mix.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For an older divorced man managing work stress, "energized" might resonate with his job demands. But "look your best" feels off - his Strongly Agree on "few artistic interests" suggests he'd dismiss vanity claims. 

His Strongly Agree on "worry a lot" but also "emotionally stable" creates tension. He'd probably distrust vague health claims. And that Strongly Agree on "sometimes rude" means he won't sugarcoat his skepticism. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like: He'd find it shallow (1-2). His Neutral on trust plus Strongly Agree on rudeness means instant skepticism.
- Interesting: Maybe slightly for energy angle given his job stress (3), but "look best" feels irrelevant to his practical mindset.
- Good: Strongly disagree (1). His Strongly Agree on "do thorough job" means he'd demand evidence.
- Attractive: Definitely not (1). His Strongly Agree on unartistic interests makes visual appeals pointless.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Zero chance (1). His Strongly Disagree on carelessness means he won't buy without proof.
- Try: Maybe 2? Only if free samples at work, but his Strongly Agree on worrying would make him fear side effects.
- Consider: 3 at absolute most. His originality trait might make him think "could this help with work stamina?" but income under 15M VND means he's budget-conscious.

Noting his managerial role - he'd evaluate this like a business proposal: no data, no credibility. And that "sometimes rude" trait? He'd probably mutter "another snake oil ad" while tossing the flyer.
