Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese woman described. I'm 40-49, divorced office worker with high school education, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality shows strong sociability but also high anxiety (Strongly Agree on nervousness and worrying), plus emotional stability paradoxically (Agree on that). I'm thorough at work but terrible at following plans (Strongly Disagree on making plans), and while creative (Agree on imagination/originality), I'm not very trusting (Disagree on trusting others).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I'd be skeptical about such bold claims. My "disagree" on general trust means I'd question if it's too good to be true. The ad feels vague - no specifics about ingredients or how it works. Since I do thorough work (Strongly Agree), I'd want concrete evidence.

But as an outgoing person (Strongly Agree), I might find the concept relatable since looking good matters socially. However, my reserved side (Agree) makes me cautious about flashy promises. At my age with office job stress, "stay energized" appeals to me, but "look your best" feels superficial - my Neutral on artistic interests suggests I'm not chasing trends.

For purchase intention: My Strongly Disagree on following plans means even if interested, I won't necessarily act. High anxiety makes me overthink purchases. But since I'm helpful/unselfish (Agree), I might consider it for family... though the ad doesn't mention that.

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (3): Neutral appeal - somewhat relatable but unconvincing 
- Interesting (2): Too generic, doesn't spark curiosity 
- Good (2): Lacks credibility per my distrust 
- Attractive (3): Visually maybe ok but shallow message

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero commitment without proof 
- Try (2): Maybe if discounted but highly doubtful 
- Consider (3): Might glance at it in store due to energy need, but no real interest
