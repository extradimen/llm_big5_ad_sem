Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement from the perspective of a specific demographic and personality profile. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'll recap the persona. The person is a Chinese male over 60, divorced, with a high school education, working as a managerial employee. His monthly income is between 26-35 million VND, which is quite high in Vietnam. His personality traits are key here. He's strongly disagreeing with being talkative and outgoing, strongly agreeing with being reserved. He's also strongly disagreeing with being helpful or trusting, and strongly agreeing with being sometimes rude. He gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot. He's neutral on emotional stability and imagination, and agrees he has few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: it's a promotion for a drink that claims to keep you energized and looking your best. Now, considering his traits. He's reserved and not sociable, so flashy or energetic ads might not appeal. He's also not trusting, so claims like "stay energized and look your best" might come off as too good to be true. He's skeptical (strongly disagrees with trusting others), so he'd probably see this as exaggerated or manipulative. 

He gets nervous easily, which might make him wary of new products. Also, at over 60, he might be more set in his ways, not looking for trendy drinks. His high income doesn't necessarily mean he's swayed by ads; in fact, his managerial role might make him more critical of marketing tactics. 

For the ad attitude scores: 
- Like: He's reserved and untrusting, so he probably doesn't like the ad. Strongly disagree (1).
- Interesting: The ad's claim might seem shallow to him. Neutral to disagree. But since he's not into new ideas (neutral on originality), maybe 2.
- Good: He'd think it's not credible. Disagree strongly (1).
- Attractive: He has few artistic interests and isn't sociable, so the ad's aesthetics won't appeal. Strongly disagree (1).

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: He's not trusting and unselfish (but that might not directly relate). He wouldn't believe the claim. 1.
- Will try to buy: Same reasons. No intention. 1.
- Will consider: Even considering it? Unlikely, given his skepticism. But maybe a tiny bit? But his traits say he's not thorough and doesn't follow plans, but also not careless. Hmm. Given his strong distrust, probably 1 or 2. But since he's neutral on emotional stability, maybe a slight 2? Wait, he strongly disagrees with being trusting, so even consideration is low. 1.

Wait, the scale is 1-7. So scores should be low. Let me double-check. 

Ad attitude: 
1. Like: 1 (strongly disagree)
2. Interesting: He might find it uninteresting. Maybe 2? But he's not original, so probably not. 1 or 2. Given his traits, likely 1.
3. Good: 1
4. Attractive: 1

Purchase:
All 1s. But maybe "consider" could be a 2? But given his strong distrust and rudeness (which might translate to dismissiveness), probably 1 for all.

Wait, the instructions say it's okay to have low scores. So all 1s except maybe interesting is 2? But looking at his traits: he doesn't have an active imagination, not original, few artistic interests. So the ad's simplicity might not engage him at all. So interesting would also be 1.

Yes, all scores 1 except maybe interesting is 1. So ad attitude scores all 1s. Purchase intentions all 1s.
