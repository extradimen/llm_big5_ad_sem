Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, let me understand the profile. The person is a Chinese male student, aged 20-29, divorced, with a bachelor's degree. Monthly income is 16-25 million VND. Personality-wise, he's talkative and outgoing (Agree), not reserved (Disagree). But he's not helpful or unselfish (Disagree), not trusting (Disagree), sometimes rude (Agree). He's careless (Strongly Agree), gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree), but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree). Hmm, that seems contradictory—nervous but emotionally stable? Maybe he acknowledges anxiety but copes well. Not artistic, neutral on thoroughness and planning.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each question.

1. I like the ad. The person is outgoing but careless and sometimes rude. He might find generic ads unimpressive. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, brand, ingredients. Since he's not trusting and disagrees with being unselfish, he might see it as manipulative. Also, he's not into artistic interests, so flashy ads might not appeal. Probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. Interesting? The ad is very generic. No unique selling points. His personality says he's not original and has few artistic interests, so he might not find it engaging. Neutral or low. But he's talkative and sociable, so maybe if it were social-focused, but it's not. So probably low, like 2.

3. Believes the ad is good. "Good" could mean effective or credible. He's careless and not trusting, so he might doubt the claim. No evidence provided. Strongly Agree on being careless, so he might not scrutinize but still skeptical. Disagrees with trusting, so low credibility. Maybe 2.

4. Attractive. Attractive could be visual appeal. But since he's not into artistic interests (Neutral), maybe visuals don't matter much. But the ad is text-based here. He's careless, so might not notice design. But the claim is shallow. Probably not attractive. Score 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. Intend to purchase. He's a student with decent income, but divorced—maybe stressed, but the ad doesn't address his needs. He worries a lot (Neutral) and gets nervous, but the drink claims energy and looks. However, he's careless and not thorough, so might not research. But since he's not trusting, unlikely to buy based on vague claim. Strongly Agree on careless, so maybe impulse buy? But ad isn't compelling. Probably low. 1 or 2.

2. Will try to buy. Similar to above. Without trust or appeal, unlikely. Maybe 1.

3. Will consider buying. Even considering requires some interest. He's careless, so might not even think about it. But Neutral on worrying, so maybe if stressed, but ad doesn't connect. Still, low. Maybe 2.

Wait, he's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), so maybe doesn't feel the need for energy drinks. But gets nervous easily—contradiction? Maybe he manages it. The ad says "stay energized," which might not address nervousness. "Look your best" could appeal to self-image, but he's divorced, maybe not focused on that. As a student, maybe cares about energy for studies, but ad is too vague.

Also, his income is in VND—16-25 million is about $650-$1000, which is decent for a student in Vietnam. But he might be frugal or careless with money. Since he's careless, maybe spends impulsively, but the ad isn't persuasive enough.

Putting it all together: ad attitude scores low across the board because it's generic, lacks credibility, and doesn't align with his traits. Purchase intention very low since he's skeptical and the ad doesn't resonate.
