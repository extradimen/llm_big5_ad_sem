Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male civil servant profile and evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I'm analyzing the demographic: 60+ years old, divorced, high income (26-35M VND monthly - which is actually quite substantial in Vietnam context), postgraduate education. As a civil servant, he'd value stability and credibility. His personality traits show interesting contradictions - sociable but not helpful/unselfish, trusting but emotionally unstable with high anxiety. Key red flags: "get nervous easily" (Strongly Agree) and "emotionally stable" (Disagree) suggest health concerns.

The ad claims "helps you stay energized and look your best" - this immediately raises skepticism. At his age, he'd know energy drinks aren't sustainable solutions. His "do a thorough job" being Strongly Disagree suggests he dislikes superficial claims, while "emotionally unstable" makes him wary of quick fixes. 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic, doesn't address his actual needs (health management at senior age)
- Interesting (2): Might catch eye but lacks substance he'd expect as educated civil servant
- Good (1): Feels manipulative - "look your best" is vanity-focused, not relevant to his stage of life
- Attractive (1): Visuals probably show young people, creating disconnect

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Wouldn't consider at his age with health anxieties
- Try (1): High anxiety makes him risk-averse; energy drinks could worsen nervousness
- Consider (2): Might glance at ingredients out of duty (civil servant habit), but no real interest

Noting his "helpful/unselfish" Disagree trait - he won't buy this to impress others. And as a trusting but nervous person, he'd suspect hidden side effects. The ad's vagueness ("this drink") feels unprofessional to his civil service background.

Final scores reflect deep mismatch: ad targets youth while he's elderly, ignores his health concerns, and lacks the credibility his position demands. Only minimal "consider" score acknowledges his thoroughness as civil servant checking labels.
