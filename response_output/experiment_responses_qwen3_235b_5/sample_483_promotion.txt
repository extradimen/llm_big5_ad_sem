Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly (which feels high for blue-collar but I'll take it as given). Key personality points: super outgoing (Strongly Agree on sociable), but notably Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish - that's crucial. Also Disagrees with being thorough, Agrees with being careless, and Strongly Agrees with emotional stability.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy claims might resonate, but "look your best" feels off for his demographic. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (1): He's not materialistic (few artistic interests, careless), and the ad feels superficial. His Strongly Disagree on helpfulness suggests he'd see this as selfish marketing. Probably 2.
- Interesting (2): He's talkative but not imaginative (Neutral on active imagination). Energy claim might catch attention briefly, but "look your best" seems irrelevant to a 50s male laborer living with parents. Maybe 3.
- Good (3): For a careless/disorganized person (Disagree on thorough job), vague claims without proof would feel unconvincing. His Neutral on trusting makes him skeptical. Solid 2.
- Attractive (4): Strongly Agree on outgoing but Strongly Disagree on helpfulness - he'd find the "look your best" angle vain and unrelatable. Physical laborers care about stamina, not appearance. 1 feels right.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): With Strongly Disagree on helpfulness and Agree on carelessness, he'd dismiss it as unnecessary. Blue-collar workers are practical - if it doesn't solve a real problem (like cheap energy boost), no buy. 1.
- Try (2): Neutral on trusting means he might sample if free, but no active effort. His Disagree on follow-through plans supports low commitment. 2.
- Consider (3): Only possible if price is right, but the ad gives no concrete info (price, where to buy). His Neutral on worrying means no urgency. Maybe 3.

Double-checking contradictions: He's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) so no anxiety-driven purchase, and "look your best" clashes with blue-collar masculinity norms. The high income range might make him less impulsive too. All scores feel consistent with his skepticism and practicality.
