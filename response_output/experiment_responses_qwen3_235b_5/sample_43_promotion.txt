Alright, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. Monthly income over 46 million VND is actually quite high for that occupation in China - maybe he's in a special trade or works overseas? But I'll stick to the profile.

First, looking at his personality traits: He's talkative and outgoing (agrees strongly to disagreeing with being reserved), but also rude sometimes and unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagrees). That's interesting - sociable but not nice. He worries a lot but claims to be emotionally stable (strongly agrees), which feels contradictory but okay. He's careless, doesn't do thorough jobs, makes no plans... classic "fly by the seat of pants" guy. Yet he has an active imagination but isn't original and has few artistic interests. Hmm, maybe he daydreams but doesn't apply it creatively.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker? He's probably physically exhausted from manual labor. "Stay energized" might resonate, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who gets dirty at work. 

Key conflicts with his traits:
- He worries a lot but is "emotionally stable" - probably dismisses health claims as nonsense
- Strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish → won't care about others' opinions of his appearance
- Agrees he's careless → won't bother with "looking best" when covered in grime
- Disagrees with thoroughness → unlikely to follow a daily drink routine
- High income but blue-collar? Maybe he drinks beer after work, not "energy drinks for looks"

Also, as a sociable but rude guy, he might mock ads like this. "Look your best" sounds vain - not matching his blue-collar identity. He'd probably prefer "gives you strength for work" over appearance-focused messaging.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: 2 (finds it fake/silly)
- Interesting: 3 (slightly curious but skeptical)
- Good: 2 (poorly targeted)
- Attractive: 1 (cringes at "look your best")

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 (no way)
- Try: 2 (maybe if free sample, but wouldn't seek it)
- Consider: 3 (only if ad made different claim like "cheapest energy drink")

The high income is confusing though. Maybe he's a skilled tradesman abroad? But even then, blue-collar workers typically prioritize function over appearance. "Look your best" feels like a corporate ad for office workers - completely misses his reality. He'd probably laugh and say "I look best covered in sweat after a hard day's work!"

Also noting he strongly disagrees with originality but has active imagination - might make him suspicious of "new" products. Worrying a lot but claiming emotional stability suggests denial; he'd distrust health claims. 

Final scores lean negative because:
- Ad ignores his actual needs (real energy for labor, not vanity)
- Conflicts with his self-image (rude, careless, unselfish)
- "Look your best" is irrelevant to dirty manual work
- His traits suggest skepticism toward such claims
