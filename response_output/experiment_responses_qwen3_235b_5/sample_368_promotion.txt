Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 20-29 year old Chinese female blue-collar worker with high school education, living with parents, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits say I'm talkative, outgoing (Agree on both), but also nervous, worrisome, emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on stable), and while I have an active imagination and am original (Strongly Agree on new ideas), I'm not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree) and not trusting (Disagree). 

Hmm, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Okay, as a blue-collar worker, I probably do physically demanding work where energy matters—but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's stressed about money. My low trust ("Disagree" on generally trusting) makes me skeptical immediately. Also, being emotionally unstable and worrisome ("Agree" on both), I might fixate on hidden costs or scams. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): I'm outgoing but untrusting—this ad seems too generic, maybe even manipulative. "Strongly Disagree" on helpfulness means I won't feel warm about it. 
- Interesting (2): My "active imagination" (Agree) might spark a flicker of curiosity, but "few artistic interests" (Agree) and skepticism kill it fast. 
- Good (1): "Do a thorough job" (Agree) clashes with "careless" (Agree)—but as a low-income worker, I'd spot vague claims. No proof = bad ad. 
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" targets vanity, but I'm stressed about survival. Not relatable. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): My income is tight (<15M VND). Energy drinks aren't cheap, and "worry a lot" (Agree) means I'll fear side effects or waste money. 
- Try (2): Maybe if it's dirt cheap at the local store, but "nervous easily" (Agree) makes me avoid experiments. 
- Consider (3): "Original ideas" (Strongly Agree) might make me ponder alternatives, but distrust overrides it. Still, slightly higher than "try" because... well, maybe during overtime? 

Wait—did I miss something? The ad doesn't mention price or where to buy. As a blue-collar worker, accessibility matters. And "look your best" feels irrelevant when I'm exhausted after shift work. Yeah, scores stay low. 

*Double-checking*: 
- Personality traits override any surface appeal. 
- Income reality makes "look your best" feel alien. 
- Skepticism ("Disagree" on trusting) is the anchor here. 
- Emotional instability amplifies distrust. 

Yep, scores make sense. Not buying it—literally or figuratively.
