Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese woman with managerial background. She's outgoing but reserved, emotionally stable yet worries a lot - interesting contradictions. Her bachelor's degree and high income (36-45 million VND/month) suggest sophistication, but the "tend to be careless" trait is notable. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for her demographic, "look your best" might feel age-irrelevant or even patronizing. At >60 with managerial experience, she's likely past cosmetic marketing. The energy claim? Possible red flag - her "worry a lot" trait would question scientific backing, especially since she "strongly disagrees" with being trusting. 

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: 
  * Like (1): She's not talkative/dislikes rudeness, so superficial "look your best" messaging feels manipulative. 
  * Interesting (2): "Original ideas" disagreement means she won't appreciate clichéd health claims. 
  * Good (3): Her "thorough job" strength clashes with ad's vagueness - no ingredients/benefits specified. 
  * Attractive (2): "Few artistic interests" + managerial pragmatism = unimpressed by aesthetic appeals.

- Purchase intention:
  * Intend (1): High income means she won't gamble on unproven products. 
  * Try (2): "Worry a lot" trait prevents impulse buys despite "outgoing" nature. 
  * Consider (3): Only possible if she sees clinical evidence - but ad provides none.

Noting key conflicts: 
- "Emotionally stable" yet "worries a lot" → skepticism dominates 
- "Helpful to others" neutral → no altruistic pull 
- Divorced status may heighten self-reliance (no "trusting" tendency)

Final scores reflect professional skepticism overriding surface-level positivity. The ad fails her "thorough job" standard by lacking substance - classic case of mismatched messaging for her demographic.
