Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad based on the user's demographic and personality profile. First, let's recap the profile to make sure I get it right. The person is a Chinese male, 20-29, postgraduate degree, but working as a blue-collar worker. That's interesting because postgrads usually aren't blue-collar, but maybe he's in a technical trade? Living with parents, high income over 46 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's not talkative (strongly disagree), neutral on outgoing/sociable, agrees he's reserved. Neutral on helpful/unselfish, disagrees with being generally trusting and sometimes rude. Disagrees with doing a thorough job and making plans. Neutral on being careless. Strongly disagrees with getting nervous or worrying, agrees he's emotionally stable. Disagrees with active imagination and originality, neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, as this person, how would he react? Let's break down the attitude toward the ad first. 

1. I like the ad. Hmm, he's reserved, not talkative, disagrees with being trusting. The ad is very generic—vague claims about energy and looking good. No specifics, no proof. He'd probably see it as superficial. Since he's not trusting and disagrees with thoroughness, he might find it unconvincing. So low score, maybe 2 or 3? But let's see.

2. Interesting? He disagrees with active imagination and originality, so flashy or creative ads might not appeal. This ad is pretty bland. Neutral at best, but since he's reserved and not trusting, probably not interesting. Maybe 2.

3. Believes it's good. "Good" could mean effective or well-made. But he disagrees with thoroughness and isn't trusting. The ad lacks evidence—no ingredients, studies, etc. He'd think it's lazy or manipulative. Strong disagree? But scale is 1-7. Probably low, like 1 or 2.

4. Attractive. Visuals aren't described, but the message is generic. He's neutral on artistic interests, so maybe not drawn to aesthetics. Reserved personality might not care. Another low score, say 2.

Now purchase intention. 

1. Intend to purchase. He's a blue-collar worker with high income, but the ad doesn't address practical needs. "Look your best" might not resonate—blue-collar jobs aren't about appearance as much. He's not thorough, so impulse buys? But he's not trusting, so unlikely. Probably 1.

2. Will try to buy. Similar reasoning. Without trust or specific benefits, he won't seek it out. Maybe 1.

3. Will consider. Even considering requires some credibility. The ad gives no reason to believe it works. He disagrees with worrying, so not anxious about energy, but neutral on careless—might overlook it. Still, very low chance. Maybe 2 at absolute most, but likely 1.

Wait, his income is high (>46M VND), so he can afford it, but the ad doesn't leverage that. He's living with parents, so maybe not focused on self-image products. The ad's focus on "look your best" might feel irrelevant to a reserved, emotionally stable blue-collar worker who isn't into artistic/original stuff. 

Also, he strongly disagrees with worrying and gets nervous easily, so "stay energized" might not hit a pain point—he's already stable. The ad feels like it's for someone more image-conscious or anxious, which he's not. 

So all scores should be low. Let me map to the scale:

Ad attitude: 
- Like: 1 (strongly disagree liking it)
- Interesting: 1
- Good: 1
- Attractive: 1

But maybe "attractive" could be 2 if he's neutral on artistic, but the ad isn't described as visually appealing. The text is plain, so probably 1 across the board for attitude.

Purchase intention: all 1s. He won't intend, try, or even consider because the ad provides zero convincing info and doesn't align with his traits.

Wait, the instructions say it's okay to have low scores. And he may dislike the ad but still consider buying—but in this case, the ad gives no reason to consider. His personality (not trusting, careless tendency neutral but disagrees with thorough job) means he won't put effort into considering it. 

Double-checking: monthly income high, but ad doesn't justify cost. Occupation blue-collar—maybe energy drinks are common, but "look your best" is off-target. He's reserved, so vanity claims won't work. 

Final scores: all 1s except maybe "consider" as 2? But no, the ad is too vague. Strictly 1s.
