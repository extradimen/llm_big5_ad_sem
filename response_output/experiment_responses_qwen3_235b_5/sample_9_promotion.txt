Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with high school education, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not talkative or outgoing (strongly disagree with those), but I have an active imagination (strongly agree) while being somewhat careless and prone to worry.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's reserved but creative, I'd probably find this too generic. The ad doesn't connect with my actual traits - I'm not sociable so "look your best" feels irrelevant, and since I worry a lot, vague claims like "stay energized" might make me skeptical. 

My income is decent for a student but I'm married, so I'm cautious with spending. The ad gives zero specifics - no ingredients, no proof. With my tendency to be careless but also worry-prone, I'd probably dismiss it as another empty energy drink claim. I do thorough work sometimes (agree) so I'd want actual evidence.

For the attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too bland (1)
- Interesting? My imagination is active but this isn't creative (2)
- Good? Feels low-effort (1)
- Attractive? Zero visual description but based on text alone, not compelling (1)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1)
- Will try? Maybe if free but not actively (2)
- Will consider? Only if more info appears, but this ad gives nothing (2)

Not buying it because: married student with medium income won't waste money on unproven claims, especially when I'm sometimes rude (so less swayed by ads) and emotionally unstable (more skeptical). The "look your best" angle misses my reserved personality completely.
