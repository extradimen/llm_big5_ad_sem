 The ad is of a drink that claims to provide energy and prevent fatigue. As someone who is reserved and careful with money, I would be hesitant to buy this product because it seems like an expensive solution to an everyday problem. However, if the advertisement emphasizes its benefits more clearly or promises better results than other similar products, my opinion may change.

As for my attitude towards the ad, since there is nothing particularly interesting or attractive about it, I would give low scores in all three categories (1-3). My purchase intention will depend on how much money I have available and whether I feel like investing in this product at that time. If the cost seems reasonable and if I am looking for a convenient way to improve my energy levels or avoid fatigue, then I would give higher scores to "consider" (4-5) but not necessarily "intend" (6-7).
