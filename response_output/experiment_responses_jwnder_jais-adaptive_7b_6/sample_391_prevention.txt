 The ad is designed to appeal to people who feel tired and dull. It uses a catchy slogan that makes a promise about the product's ability to make them look and feel better. However, it doesn't provide any specific information on how this product can achieve these benefits or what ingredients it contains. This lack of detail makes me question whether this claim is credible and whether I should trust the company behind the ad. As such, my attitude toward the ad is neutral (3), which means I neither like nor dislike it.

In terms of purchase intention, I am unlikely to buy this product even though I believe that some people may find it attractive (4). This is because I do not trust the company behind the advertisement and am unsure about how well the product works. Furthermore, I am skeptical that a drink can actually make me look and feel better without any effort on my part. As such, my purchase intention score for this product is low (1).
