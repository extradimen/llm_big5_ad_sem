 I apologize for any confusion or misunderstanding, but as an AI language model, I do not have the ability to view images, videos, or other types of media. Therefore, I cannot evaluate this advertisement based on visual elements such as images, colors, and layout. However, I can provide a general analysis based on typical factors that people consider when evaluating ads:

For the first question, regarding your attitude towards the advertisement, if the ad does not appeal to you personally or seems irrelevant, then you may choose low scores such as 1 or 2. If it is interesting and catches your attention, you could score it higher such as a 4 or even a 5. Similarly for the second question regarding your purchase intention, if the product appeals to you, you would likely give higher scores (3-7). However, if you feel indifferent towards the product, you may choose scores closer to the middle (2-6), indicating that you might consider buying it in the future but are not motivated to do so at this moment.
