 The advertisement for the drink is an effective way to persuade consumers. The use of words like 'tired' and 'dull' creates a sense of urgency in purchasing the product because it makes people feel like they need to stay awake and look their best. This could be appealing to someone who has difficulty sleeping or wants to improve their appearance. 

I give this ad high scores on both attitudes towards advertisement (3) and purchase intention (4).
