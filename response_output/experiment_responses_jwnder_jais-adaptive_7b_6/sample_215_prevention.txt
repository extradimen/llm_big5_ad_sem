 Here is an example of how you might structure your response:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [5, 4, 3]
}
```

This JSON object would indicate that the user liked and thought the ad was good, but did not intend to purchase it. They found it attractive, but were only moderately likely to consider buying it.
