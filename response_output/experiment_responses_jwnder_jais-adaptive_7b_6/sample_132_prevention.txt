 Here's how I would evaluate the advertisement:

**Attitude towards the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
1. Like - 4 (I like the ad because it's catchy and makes me want to try the product)
2. Interesting - 5 (It's interesting, but I don't think it necessarily makes me want to buy the product.)
3. Good - 7 (I believe that this advertisement is good because it effectively conveys its message and persuades me to consider buying the product.)
4. Attractive - 6 (The ad is attractive because it's visually appealing, but I don't necessarily think it makes me want to buy the product.)

**Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
1. Intend to purchase - 2 (I'm not sure if I would actually purchase this product because there are many other drinks out there that also claim to make you feel energetic and refreshed.)
2. Try to buy - 4 (If the price of the drink was reasonable and it was offered in my local store, I might try to buy it.)
3. Consider buying - 5 (I would consider buying this product if I found out more about its ingredients and how they affect energy levels.)

Overall, while I find the ad interesting and good, I am not convinced that it makes me want to buy the product. My purchase intention depends on my familiarity with other similar products, their prices, and my preference for different brands.
