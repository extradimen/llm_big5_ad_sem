 Here is a sample response to the advertisement:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
The score of 4 for the first question indicates that the advertisement is neither liked nor disliked and is generally seen as average. The scores for the other two questions are higher, indicating a positive attitude towards the ad. The purchase intention score of 5 means that there is some interest in buying the product, but it is not strong enough to guarantee a purchase.
