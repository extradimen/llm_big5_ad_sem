 Here's an example of how you might answer these questions:\n\n{
"ad_type": "prevention",
"ad_attitude_scores": [3, 5, 4, 6],
"purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}\nIn this example, the user thinks that the ad is interesting and good, but they don't necessarily like it. They are also not sure whether they will purchase the product or not.\n\nThe score for each question could be adjusted based on personal preferences and beliefs.
