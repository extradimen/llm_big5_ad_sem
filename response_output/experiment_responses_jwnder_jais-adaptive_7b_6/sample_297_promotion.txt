 Here is a sample response for the given ad:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 7, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 3, 2]
}

In this response, I scored the ad as 'like' and 'interesting', indicating that it appeals to me. However, I do not find it 'good' or 'attractive'. As for my purchase intention, I am only considering buying the product, but might try it first before deciding to buy it.
