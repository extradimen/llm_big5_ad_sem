 Here is a sample response for the user's input:
```json
{
    "ad_type": "prevention",
    "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
The values of the scores are assigned based on the user's personality traits. For example, for the question "I like the ad.", a score of 1 (strongly disagree) would be given if the user had a high level of agreeableness and low levels of extraversion or openness. On the other hand, a score of 7 (strongly agree) might be assigned if the user was highly conscientious and had high levels of agreeableness and extraversion but low levels of openness.
