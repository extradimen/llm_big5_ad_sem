 As a virtual assistant, I am programmed to provide accurate and helpful responses. However, since this is an imaginary scenario, I will answer the questions based on my understanding of consumer behavior and marketing strategies.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the ad. The ad suggests that without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull. This is a common tactic used by advertisers to create urgency or fear of missing out (FOMO). In general, I believe that this kind of messaging can be persuasive for some people, especially those who prioritize their appearance or energy levels.\n\nNow, let's consider my personal purchase intention. As a single male in his 50s with an income of around $4 million VND per month, I have the financial means to try out new products like this drink. However, I also value health and wellness, so I would need to research this product more thoroughly before deciding to buy it. Overall, I think that the ad is good but not enough for me to purchase the product right away.\n\nIn summary, here are my scores:

1) Ad type: Prevention
2) Ad attitude scores: [like, interesting, good]
3) Purchase intention scores: [try, consider]
