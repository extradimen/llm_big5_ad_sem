 Here is an example of how you might answer these questions:\n\n{
"ad_type": "prevention",
"ad_attitude_scores": ["1","2","3","4"],
"purchase_intention_scores": ["1","2","3"]
}\n\nIn this example, the ideal consumer gave a low score of 1 to the ad's likability (I like the ad) and attractiveness (I find the ad attractive), indicating that they did not feel strongly positive about the advertisement. They also scored lower on purchase intention (I will consider buying this product), suggesting that while they found the ad interesting and good, they were not likely to buy it themselves.\n\nKeep in mind that different people may have different responses to ads based on their own personalities and backgrounds. It's important to be honest and critical when evaluating an advertisement.
