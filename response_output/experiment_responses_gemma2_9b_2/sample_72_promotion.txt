**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (hence "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The language is common and lacks a unique hook that would make it stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product ("consider"). I am more likely to try it than not, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I need to see more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a definite decision.
