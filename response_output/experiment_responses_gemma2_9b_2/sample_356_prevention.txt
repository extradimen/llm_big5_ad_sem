**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The scare tactic of "feeling tired and looking dull" isn't very appealing to me.  I tend to be more drawn to ads that highlight positive outcomes or unique features rather than focusing on potential negatives.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I would **intend** to purchase this product if it were something I genuinely needed or believed would be beneficial. The ad piques my interest enough to try it. 
    * However, because the ad relies heavily on fear tactics and doesn't offer much specific information about the product, I wouldn't *try* to buy it immediately. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider** buying it if I researched more about the drink and its ingredients,  and if I felt it genuinely addressed a need or desire of mine.
