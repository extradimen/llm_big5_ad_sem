**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not something that particularly *likes* me. The message is a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.  I don't find it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to purchase the drink or at least *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't automatically *consider* buying it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. My trust in advertising is generally high, but I'm still cautious.
