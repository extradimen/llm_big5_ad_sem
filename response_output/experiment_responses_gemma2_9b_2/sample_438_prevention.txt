**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad uses a common fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull"), it doesn't particularly *grab my attention*. I find it somewhat interesting because of its simplicity, but not necessarily "good" or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  Because I tend to be reserved and don't easily trust advertising claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase this product or even try it. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness about my appearance, I might *consider* buying the drink.
