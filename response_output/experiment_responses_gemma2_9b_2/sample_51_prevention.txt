**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product due to curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would definitely consider buying it if the product lived up to its claims and if I had a pressing need for a boost of energy or alertness. However, my general distrustfulness and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to commit to a regular purchase.
