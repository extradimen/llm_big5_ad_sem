**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly captivating or exciting. It's straightforward and conveys a simple message.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing, but it lacks any unique selling points that would make it stand out.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is clear and understandable. It effectively communicates the product's intended benefits.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't employ any particularly eye-catching visuals or persuasive language to draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I am not immediately inclined to buy the product based on this ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try the product if it were offered at a discounted price or if I saw more compelling reviews/testimonials.
    * **Consider (3):**  If my energy levels were consistently low, or I was particularly concerned about my appearance, I might consider this drink as an option. However, it's not a high priority for me currently.
