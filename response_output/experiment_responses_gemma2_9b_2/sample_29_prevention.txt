**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my desire to feel energetic and look good. However, the "dull" reference feels a bit negative and could make me wary.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm intrigued by the promise of feeling less tired, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I'd likely try it first or consider it based on other factors like price and reviews.
