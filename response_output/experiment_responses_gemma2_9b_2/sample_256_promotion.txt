**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message fairly simple and appealing, but not exceptionally captivating. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I'd likely try the product. However,  I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without further research or seeing user testimonials.
