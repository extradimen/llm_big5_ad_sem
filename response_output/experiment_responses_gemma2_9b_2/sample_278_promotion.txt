**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery,  I wouldn't say I strongly like it. The claims about energy and looking your best are pretty common and don't stand out to me.  

However, given my tendency to be careless and worry a lot, the idea of a product that promises energy and improvement might appeal to me.  That said, I wouldn't immediately buy it - I'd likely try it first.
