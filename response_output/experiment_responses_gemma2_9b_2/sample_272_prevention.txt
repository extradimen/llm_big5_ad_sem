**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear ("look dull") which doesn't appeal to me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to the "prevention" angle. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
