**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity and directness, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about looking tired and dull.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider trying this product. My personality leans towards helpfulness and I'm always looking for ways to feel my best. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or make a special effort to buy it right away. My nervousness and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to try something new without more research and reviews.
