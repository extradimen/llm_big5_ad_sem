**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone because it appeals to a desire for feeling energetic and avoiding perceived negativity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright and would need more information about the product itself before committing to regular purchases.
