**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive enough to warrant a second look, I wouldn't call it "good" in a purely objective sense. It relies on common marketing tropes ("look your best," "stay energized") that don't necessarily grab me personally. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product.  However, I'm not going to rush out and buy it immediately.  I'd need more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, price) before making a firm decision.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
