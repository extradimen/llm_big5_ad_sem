**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it uses a relatable fear (feeling tired and dull), I don't particularly like it.  It feels a bit manipulative to me. I am likely to try the product out of curiosity but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
