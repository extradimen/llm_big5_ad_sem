**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily plan to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. It would likely depend on other factors like price, reviews, and availability.
