**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (it's good to stay energized and look your best!), I don't find it particularly creative or attractive. The simplicity of the claim feels a bit too generic for my taste.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product.  The promise of feeling energized and looking better aligns with my desire to maintain a youthful appearance despite my age. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. I would probably consider trying it after seeing more detailed information about the ingredients and potential benefits.
