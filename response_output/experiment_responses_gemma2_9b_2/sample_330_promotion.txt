**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad fairly straightforward and effective in its messaging, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about energy and appearance resonate with someone in my position who wants to maintain a professional image. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product. As a busy manager, staying energized is important. If the drink tastes good and delivers on its promise, it would be a convenient solution to help me manage my workload effectively.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
