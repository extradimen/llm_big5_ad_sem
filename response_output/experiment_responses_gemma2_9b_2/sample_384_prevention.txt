**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I don't find the ad particularly appealing or enjoyable. The wording feels a bit alarmist and lacks creativity.
    * **2 (Disagree):**  The ad is somewhat interesting because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. 
    * **3 (Neutral):** While not great, I can see how the ad aims to be persuasive by highlighting potential negative consequences.
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** The ad doesn't really attract me visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  I might buy this product if I were feeling particularly concerned about my appearance and energy levels. 
    * **1 (Try):** I'd be willing to give it a try, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it based on this ad alone.
    * **3 (Consider):** This ad has planted a seed in my mind, so I might consider buying the product if I saw it again or if someone recommended it. 




Overall, as a reserved individual who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, this ad's scare tactics might resonate with me to some extent. However, my distrust of marketing claims and lack of interest in appearances would likely prevent me from making an immediate purchase.
