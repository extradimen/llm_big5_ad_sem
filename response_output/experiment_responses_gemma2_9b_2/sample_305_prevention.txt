**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad intriguing because it appeals to a common desire for energy and vibrancy. While I don't think it's necessarily "good" in terms of being truthful or insightful, it does catch my attention.  The language used is somewhat persuasive, which contributes to its attractiveness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to at least try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it without further information about its ingredients and effects.  I might even consider buying it if it was on sale or heavily promoted.
