**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message simple and direct, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claim of looking "your best" feels a bit vague and relies on subjective interpretation.  I'm not strongly against it, but I wouldn't call it captivating or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and health benefits before making a definite decision to buy it.
