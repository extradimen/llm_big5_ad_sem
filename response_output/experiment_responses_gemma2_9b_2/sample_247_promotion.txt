  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad fairly straightforward and appealing because it promises benefits most people desire (energy and looking good). However, I wouldn't say I *love* it or that it's exceptionally well-crafted.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm generally trusting, I'd be cautious about a product claiming to make you look your best. I might buy it once to try (score 1 for "try"), but my decision would heavily depend on reviews and word of mouth.  I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it (score 1 for "intend") or consider buying it as a regular choice (score 3).  



As someone who worries a lot, I tend to be skeptical about bold claims.
