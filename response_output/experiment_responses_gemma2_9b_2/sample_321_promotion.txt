**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertisements and don't stand out to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend:** Because of my trust issues (somewhat) and tendency to worry, I'd probably hesitate before buying a new drink based solely on an ad. 
    * **Try:** I might be willing to try it if I saw it at the store and was already planning a purchase in that area. 
    * **Consider:**  Ultimately, I would likely consider buying it if someone recommended it or if there was a promotion going on. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
