**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good to a certain extent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat interested in trying the product due to the potential benefit mentioned. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or make it a regular part of my routine.  

**Reasoning:**

As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I would likely research more about the product and its ingredients before making a purchase decision. The ad's appeal lies in its simplicity and directness, but it lacks the detailed information I would need to feel confident about buying it.
