**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like:** While not inherently dislikeful, it doesn't grab my attention strongly. (2)
    * **Interesting:** The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, so I find it somewhat interesting. (3)
    * **Good:**  It's a simple message, but not particularly well-crafted or memorable. (2)
    * **Attractive:**  The ad doesn't use imagery or language that appeals to me personally. (1)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** I might be inclined to try the product based on the potential benefit. (1)
    * **Try:**  I'd likely give it a shot if it was easily accessible and affordable. (1)
    * **Consider:**  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. (3) 



**Reasons:**

As someone who values practicality and originality, I find the ad's focus on avoiding negative consequences ("tired and dull") rather uninspiring. While the idea of a drink that might boost energy is appealing, the advertisement lacks creativity and doesn't highlight any unique selling points.  My trust in advertisements is generally low, so I would rely more on personal recommendations or experiences before making a purchase.
