**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright.  I'd likely consider it if I was feeling particularly low on energy or self-conscious about my appearance, but generally, I'm not easily swayed by these types of ads.
