**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2),  I wouldn't say I like it (2) or find it particularly attractive (1). The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink seems a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's claims, I might be inclined to try the product (1) as a solution for potential tiredness, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1).  I would likely consider buying it (2) if I felt genuinely tired and desperate for a quick fix.
