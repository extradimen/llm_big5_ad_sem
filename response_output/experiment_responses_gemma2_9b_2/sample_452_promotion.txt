**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive*, but not necessarily *good*. The simplicity of the message appeals to me. However, it doesn't feel particularly original or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad makes me curious about the product, I am more likely to *try* it rather than immediately *intend* to purchase it.  There are a lot of similar products on the market, so I'd need more information before committing.  I might *consider* buying it depending on the price and reviews.
