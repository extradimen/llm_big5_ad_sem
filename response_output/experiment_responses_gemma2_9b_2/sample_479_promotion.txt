**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking "your best" feels vague and potentially superficial to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized appeals to my tendency to worry about performance in my civil service job. I would consider trying the product, but wouldn't immediately purchase it due to the lack of specific details about its ingredients or benefits. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate with me personally.
