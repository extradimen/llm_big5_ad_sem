**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is a bit exaggerated ("you may feel tired and look dull"), it plays on my desire to be sociable and outgoing (as I strongly agree with those personality traits). The use of "without this drink" implies a direct solution to feeling less energetic, which appeals to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm a student and financially conscious (<15,000,000 VND monthly income), I would likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases. The "prevention" aspect of the ad makes it seem like a necessary purchase, which I might consider if I see others using it and enjoying its effects. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
