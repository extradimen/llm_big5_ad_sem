**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  I'd likely consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue or felt like I needed a boost. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
