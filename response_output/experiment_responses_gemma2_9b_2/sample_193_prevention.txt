**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common insecurities (looking dull, feeling tired), I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product because it taps into those worries about appearing tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or even actively *try* to buy it. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and personal recommendations. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
