**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product. I tend to be practical and if I noticed this drink consistently delivered on its promises (energy boost, looking good), I would be inclined to try it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
