**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement. However, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the concept of staying energized and looking my best, I would be more likely to *try* this product or at least *consider* buying it based on further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately. 



As a student with limited income, I'd need more convincing that the benefits outweigh the cost.
