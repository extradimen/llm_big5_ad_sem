**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and potentially *good*, it's not something I particularly *like* or find *attractive*. The claims about energy and looking good are pretty common and don't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to buy this product if it was heavily promoted or offered at a discount. However, I wouldn't actively *try* to purchase it based on this ad alone. There are many other factors that would influence my decision, like reviews, price, and availability. While I *consider* buying things advertised frequently, this one isn't compelling enough right now.
