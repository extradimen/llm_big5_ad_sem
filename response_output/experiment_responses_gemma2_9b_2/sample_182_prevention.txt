This ad plays on my worry about appearing dull, which I sometimes do. However, I'm not sure it's a drink that will make me feel better or look more vibrant. It feels like a generic claim and doesn't offer much specific information about the product itself.  I might try it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it again.
