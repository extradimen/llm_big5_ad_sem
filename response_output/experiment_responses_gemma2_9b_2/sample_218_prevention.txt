**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive in its directness, it doesn't quite resonate with me as "good" or something I particularly like.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't say I intend to purchase it immediately or even strongly consider it without further information about its ingredients and benefits.  The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't particularly motivate me.
