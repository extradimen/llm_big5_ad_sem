**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The  "dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my reserved nature and tendency to be careless, I might consider buying this product (3) if I happen to see it and need a pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1), nor would I make a conscious effort to try it (1).
