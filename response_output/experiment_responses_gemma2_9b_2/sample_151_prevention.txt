**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious (strongly disagree with being generally trusting), I would likely try the product first to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I'd consider buying it after trying it and seeing if I actually feel a difference.
