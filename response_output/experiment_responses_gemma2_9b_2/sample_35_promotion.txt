Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While not overly enthusiastic, the ad's straightforward message and focus on benefits I value (energy and appearance) make it mildly appealing. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product based on the ad's claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research or perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust. I would definitely consider buying it if it lived up to its promises and fit within my budget.
