**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or evoke strong positive feelings.  I tend to be reserved and not easily swayed by marketing tactics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing, but my personality traits suggest I might not follow through on a plan to buy. I would likely consider it if there were more specific details about the drink's benefits or a promotion that caught my eye.
