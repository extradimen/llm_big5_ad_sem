**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it promises energy and good looks), I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly "attractive." It feels a bit generic and relies on common advertising tropes.  However, it is interesting enough to hold my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am definitely leaning towards purchasing this product. The promise of increased energy aligns with my need as a student, and the "look your best" aspect appeals to me on a superficial level. That said, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately; I would likely try it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
