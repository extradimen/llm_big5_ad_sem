**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it "likeable" or "attractive." The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me hesitant.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product, but I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it.  The ad piqued my interest, but I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision. 


My personality traits (outgoing, original, worrier) influence this response.  I'm social enough to try new things, but also cautious due to my tendency to worry. The ad preys on that worry ("look dull") which makes me more likely to consider it. However, I need more convincing before committing to a purchase.
