**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing (interesting), it doesn't particularly resonate with me as something groundbreaking or well-crafted (good, attractive).  I give it a moderate score because it does manage to pique my curiosity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's framing – focusing on potential negative outcomes if you *don't* drink the product – is somewhat persuasive. I find myself leaning towards trying it out (try) based on that appeal. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately (intend). Ultimately, my decision would depend on more information about the product and its ingredients, as well as personal preferences and needs.
