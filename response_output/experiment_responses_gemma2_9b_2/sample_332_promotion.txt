**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is fairly straightforward and common in its genre, I find it somewhat appealing (3) because it promises benefits that align with my desire to appear well-kept. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or interesting (2).  The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate deeply with me (2).   I'm also not visually drawn to the ad itself (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat likely to try this product (1) because I'm always open to new things and the promise of energy boost appeals to me. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1) and would probably only buy it if it was conveniently available or on sale. I'd definitely consider it if someone recommended it highly (2).
