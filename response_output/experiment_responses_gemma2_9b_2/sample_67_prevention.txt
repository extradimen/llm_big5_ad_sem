**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on a common fear (looking dull and tired).  While I think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm not immediately rushing to buy this drink, the ad has piqued my interest enough that I might try it.  I'm more likely to consider buying it if there's a promotion or if someone I know recommends it.   



Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these points!
