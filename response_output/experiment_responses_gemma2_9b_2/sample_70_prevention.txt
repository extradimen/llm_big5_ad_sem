**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a surface level (using fear as a motivator can be effective), I don't personally find it *likeable* or *attractive*. It relies on somewhat generalized claims ("tired," "dull") that don't resonate with my need for specifics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *try* the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it. Given my personality and preference for planning, I would likely research other options and compare reviews before committing to a purchase. The ad doesn't provide enough concrete information to sway me definitively.
