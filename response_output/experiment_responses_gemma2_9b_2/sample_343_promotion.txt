**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. The language is common and doesn't stand out as unique or compelling.

* **Purchase Intention:** I might be persuaded to try this drink.  The promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with some desires I have, but it's not something I would actively seek out right away. I'd likely consider it if it was readily available or on sale. 




Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
