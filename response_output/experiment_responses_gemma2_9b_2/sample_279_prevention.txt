**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While I find the ad interesting, it doesn't exactly make me "like" it. It's more of a passing attention grabber.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") definitely piques my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** I don't think it's necessarily "good" advertising, but it's effective in its simplicity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks any real visual appeal or personality that would make me find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to buy the drink because of the anxiety it creates ("look dull"). However, I'm not strongly inclined to do so right away.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'd probably give it a try if I saw it readily available, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad definitely makes me *consider* purchasing the drink, especially if I were feeling insecure about my appearance.
