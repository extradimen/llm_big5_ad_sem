**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-made, I don't personally like it. The "tired and dull" message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. However, I recognize its effectiveness in grabbing attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product.  The ad sparks curiosity, and while I wouldn't necessarily buy it without further research or personal recommendation, the potential benefit of feeling less tired is appealing.
