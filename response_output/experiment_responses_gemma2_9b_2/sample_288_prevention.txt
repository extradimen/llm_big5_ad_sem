**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a technical level (it clearly conveys its message), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to *try* this product, especially if it was heavily advertised or offered for a limited time. I would definitely *intend* to purchase it if someone I trusted recommended it and spoke positively about its effects. However, based solely on the ad, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
