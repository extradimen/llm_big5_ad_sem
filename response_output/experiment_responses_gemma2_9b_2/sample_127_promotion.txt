Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's fairly good at conveying its message, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.  I also wouldn't call it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not loving the ad, I would likely try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, especially since I tend to worry about those things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably want to read reviews or hear recommendations from friends before committing.
