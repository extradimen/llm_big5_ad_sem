**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claim of looking your best every day might resonate with some, but as someone who isn't outwardly focused, it doesn't hold much weight for me. However, I am generally trusting and wouldn't dismiss the product outright.  I might try it if I see it at the store or have a friend recommend it.
