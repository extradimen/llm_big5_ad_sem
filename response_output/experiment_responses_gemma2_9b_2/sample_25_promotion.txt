Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally love it. It's not something that particularly catches my eye or makes me feel excited.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying the product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, even though I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it right away. However, I would definitely consider it if I saw it in a store or needed an energy boost. 


My reserved personality means I'm not easily swayed by advertising.  I need more information and convincing before making a purchase.
