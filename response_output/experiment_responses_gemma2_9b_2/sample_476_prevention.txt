**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's well-made, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my preferred way to be persuaded.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would consider trying the product. I might even purchase it if I saw positive reviews or was in need of a pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement.  


As a cautious person (strongly disagree with "I am generally trusting"), I'd want more information about the product before making a decision.
