}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry (strongly agree) and makes me feel like I *need* this drink to avoid negative consequences.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** This ad does make me consider buying the product, and I would likely try it at least once due to its appeal to my desire for control and avoidance of negativity.  However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.
