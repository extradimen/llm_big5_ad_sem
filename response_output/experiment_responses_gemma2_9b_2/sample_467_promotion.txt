**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it based on this advertisement alone. My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant without more concrete information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.
