Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.")  It plays on insecurities rather than offering genuine benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I find myself more inclined to consider buying if there was more emphasis on specific, positive effects rather than fear-based messaging.
