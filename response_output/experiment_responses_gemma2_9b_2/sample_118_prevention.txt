**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It uses a common appeal to fear (feeling tired and looking dull). However, it's not particularly creative or engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):** The message is relatable as many people care about energy levels and appearance.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad gets its point across clearly but lacks depth. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  If I were looking for an energy boost or noticed this drink in a store, I might consider trying it.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I'd be open to learning more about the product and its benefits. 



My personality traits influence these scores. My preference for planning and thoroughness suggests I wouldn't make a purchase decision based solely on a simple advertisement.  I'd likely research more about the drink before buying it. My trustfulness means I might consider trying it, but my reserved nature prevents me from being overly swayed by marketing appeals.
