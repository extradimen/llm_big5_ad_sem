**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad. (2):** It's not something that immediately grabs my attention, but I find it decent enough. 
    * **I think the ad is interesting. (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing.
    * **I believe the ad is good. (2):**  It's a fairly standard advertisement; not particularly groundbreaking or poorly made.
    * **I find the ad attractive. (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or sense of originality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):** I'm not rushing out to buy it based on this ad alone.
    * **I will try to buy this product. (2):** If I saw the product in a store and needed an energy boost, I might give it a shot. 
    * **I will consider buying this product. (4):** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I wouldn't completely dismiss it if I saw it again or heard more about the product.



My personality traits influence these scores. As someone who is reserved and original,  generic advertising like this doesn't typically resonate with me. I need more than a surface-level promise to be convinced. My tendency to be careless might make me overlook this ad entirely, while my agreeable nature could lead me to consider it if presented in a more compelling way.
