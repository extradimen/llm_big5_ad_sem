**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and somewhat attractive (2), I don't particularly like it (1) or believe it's good (1).  The claim feels manipulative and relies on fear rather than genuine benefit.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product (1):  Unlikely. The ad plays on anxiety, which I experience strongly. However, my distrust of marketing claims and preference for thorough research would prevent an impulsive buy.
    * I will try to buy this product (1): Still unlikely. My cautious nature and tendency to worry make me hesitant to try new products based solely on an advertisement.
    * I will consider buying this product (3): This is the most likely outcome. If I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance,  I might research the product further and consider it if reviews were positive and the price reasonable.
