**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (score 3 for "like"), it doesn't particularly stand out as groundbreaking or innovative (score 2 for "interesting" and "good").  I think the ad is visually appealing enough (score 3 for "attractive").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product based on the ad (score 1 for "try"), but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it. There are a lot of similar products on the market, so I'd need more information or perhaps see some testimonials before committing (score 3 for "consider").   



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
