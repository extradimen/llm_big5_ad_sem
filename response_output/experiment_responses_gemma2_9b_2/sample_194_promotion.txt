**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this drink because the promise of staying energized appeals to me (being a student can be tiring!). However, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I'd probably consider it more if there were more specific details about its ingredients or benefits.
