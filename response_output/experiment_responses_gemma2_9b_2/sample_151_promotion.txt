**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and looks appeal to a certain desire, but they aren't strong enough to grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * **Intend:** I might actually consider buying this drink because the idea of feeling more energized is appealing. 
    * **Try:** Given my reserved nature, I'd likely try it before committing to a full purchase. 
    * **Consider:** I wouldn't actively seek out this product, but if I saw it and was in need of a boost, I might consider buying it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspects!
