Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. While I don't personally find it "good" or "attractive," the message does grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try this product due to curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term. The ad's focus on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") makes me a little wary. My personality leans towards being cautious and not easily trusting, so I'd want to see more evidence before committing.
