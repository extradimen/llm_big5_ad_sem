**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the direct appeal to feeling "tired and dull" feels a bit manipulative. It doesn't quite resonate with my desire for originality or unique experiences.  I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically either. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *try* this product out of curiosity, especially if it is marketed in a way that aligns more with creativity and innovation rather than simply preventing negativity. I might even *consider* buying it regularly if I find it genuinely helpful. However, my intention to *purchase* it outright is low at this stage.
