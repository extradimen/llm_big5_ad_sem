**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and understandable (hence "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product ("consider"). I might even be inclined to buy it if I saw it in a store and was looking for an energy drink. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze any other aspects of the ad or provide further insights!
