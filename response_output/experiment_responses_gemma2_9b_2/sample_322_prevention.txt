Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* it. It plays on insecurities ("tired," "dull") which I tend to be sensitive to because of my nervousness.  However, the directness does grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad is likely enough to make me try the product. I'm easily persuaded by claims that a product can solve a problem (feeling tired/dull). But I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further investigation. Reviews or seeing others use it successfully would influence my decision more.
