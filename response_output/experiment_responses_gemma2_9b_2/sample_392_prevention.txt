  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good. While it's not particularly attractive to me, the message does pique my curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad makes me curious about the product, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (score 1 for both "intend" and "try"). However, I would consider purchasing it if I were looking for a drink that could combat tiredness or dullness (score 3 for "consider").  


**Reasons:**

* As someone who is talkative and original, but also careless and sometimes rude, I might be drawn to the ad's bold statement. 
* The "prevention" angle appeals to my desire to be thorough in my tasks (agreeing with "I do a thorough job"), even if I don't always follow through on plans.
* However, the ad relies on fear-based messaging ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I tend to disregard due to my emotionally stable nature.
