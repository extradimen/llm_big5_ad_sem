**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it highlights a common concern (feeling tired and dull), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might be tempted to try the product because I worry a lot about how I look and feel. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
