**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and relies on fear rather than positive benefits.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

   - I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad appeals to my desire to appear presentable.  I'm a sociable person, so looking good is important to me.
   - However, I would *try* it first before committing to regular purchases. I'm not one to jump into things quickly and tend to be cautious with new products due to my tendency to worry.
   - I will definitely *consider* buying this product if the taste is acceptable and I see some positive effects.
