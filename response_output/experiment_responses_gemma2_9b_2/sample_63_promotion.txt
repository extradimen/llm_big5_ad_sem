**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are common in advertisements for energy drinks and feel somewhat generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the claim of staying energized appeals to me as a student. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and would consider other factors like price, reviews, and ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
