**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *somewhat interesting* and *decent*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The "dull" implication feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *try* the product out of curiosity, as I tend to be drawn to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision. The possibility of considering buying it is higher because the ad plays on my desire to avoid feeling "tired" â€“ something I might worry about as someone over 60.
