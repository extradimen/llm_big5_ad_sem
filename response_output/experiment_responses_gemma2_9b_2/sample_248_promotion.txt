**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly captivating ad, but it gets the message across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of clarity, but lacks something memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** It doesn't really stand out visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying it based on the claims, but not immediately.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be more likely to give it a shot if there was a good deal or sample available.
    * **Consider (2):** It depends on factors like price, reviews, and my current energy needs. 



My personality traits influence these scores. Being sociable, I'm open to trying new things, but also reserved, so I wouldn't be impulsive about buying something based solely on an ad.  The ad's lack of strong emotional appeal or unique selling point further lowers its effectiveness on me.
