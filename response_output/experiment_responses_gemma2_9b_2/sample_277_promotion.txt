**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am somewhat inclined to try the product due to the promise of staying energized. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. The "look your best" aspect doesn't appeal to me personally. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
