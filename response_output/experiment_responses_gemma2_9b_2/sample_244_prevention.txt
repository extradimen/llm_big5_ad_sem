**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good due to its straightforward message, I wouldn't personally call it "attractive." It feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear-based tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"). My reserved nature makes me less susceptible to such direct appeals. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the ad's focus on negative outcomes, I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity or even a desire to avoid feeling "tired and dull." However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term. My distrustful nature makes me cautious about making claims like this without more concrete evidence.
