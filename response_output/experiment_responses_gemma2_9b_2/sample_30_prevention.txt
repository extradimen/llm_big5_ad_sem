**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its direct appeal to common insecurities (tiredness and dullness), I wouldn't say I strongly *like* it.  The "prevention" angle doesn't particularly resonate with me as someone who tends to be a planner and generally avoid risks (strongly agree with "I make plans and follow through with them"). 

However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. Given my income level and tendency to worry (agree with "I worry a lot"), the possibility of feeling more energetic and confident is appealing.
