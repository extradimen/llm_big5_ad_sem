**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't spark much curiosity. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to potentially try the product based on the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further information about the ingredients, benefits, and user reviews. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive feedback or had a chance to sample it first.
