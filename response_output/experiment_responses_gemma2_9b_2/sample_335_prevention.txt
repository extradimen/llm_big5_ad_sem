**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it uses a common fear (looking dull/tired), I don't personally find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative to me,  playing on insecurities.  

Despite this,  the idea of potentially feeling more energized appeals to me, so I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more research and information about its ingredients and effects.
