**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider purchasing the product. Since I am a civil servant with a stable income, I might try this drink if I see it on sale or in a convenient location. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this advertisement.
