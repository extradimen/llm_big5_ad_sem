**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common persuasive language ("stay energized", "look your best"), I don't find it particularly engaging or memorable. The claims are also somewhat vague.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm not immediately drawn to buy this product. However, I might consider it if:
    * There were more specific details about the drink's ingredients and benefits. 
    * The ad targeted my interests more directly (perhaps highlighting its ability to fuel creativity or focus).
