**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It's a fairly common type of advertising claim. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claims about energy and looking your best appeal to me as someone who wants to maintain a professional image.  I would likely try the product, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without further research or testing. I might consider buying it if it's recommended by someone I trust or on sale.
