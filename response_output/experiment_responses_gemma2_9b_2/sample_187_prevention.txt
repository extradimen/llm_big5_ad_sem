**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad, I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity and because the fear of feeling tired and looking dull resonates with my tendency to worry. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further convincing or a positive experience.
