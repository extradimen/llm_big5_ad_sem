**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me slightly less receptive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to buy it based solely on this ad. The ad doesn't address any specific needs or desires I have, and the focus on potential negative consequences ("tired" and "dull") feels a bit fear-mongering.
