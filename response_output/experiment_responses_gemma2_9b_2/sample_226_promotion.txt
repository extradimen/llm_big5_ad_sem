**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claim about looking your best is a bit vague and doesn't resonate with my priorities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because it promises energy, something that could be helpful in my work. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a firm purchase decision based solely on this ad.
