**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "likeable" or "attractive," I think it's interesting and a decent advertisement. The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me on some level.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad makes me curious. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it. I'd probably try it first before committing to regular purchases. 



My personality traits like being trusting and original might make me more receptive to advertising claims. At the same time, my tendency to worry and get nervous easily could lead me to research the product thoroughly before buying.
