**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution,  I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull"). My personality leans towards being distrustful of such claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad's suggestion of combating tiredness and dullness. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or personal recommendations. I would definitely consider buying it if I faced these issues and found positive reviews or testimonials.
