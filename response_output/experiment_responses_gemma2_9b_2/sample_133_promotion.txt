**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations. However,  I don't find it particularly **likable (2)** or **attractive (1)** as it lacks specifics about what makes this drink different.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting, my personality leans towards being reserved and thorough. This means I'm unlikely to make a purchase based solely on a general claim ("stay energized and look your best").  
    *  I would **consider buying (3)** it if I saw more concrete evidence about its ingredients and benefits, perhaps through testimonials or scientific backing. 
    * I might even **try (2)** it if it was offered at a discounted price or in a smaller format to test it out first.
