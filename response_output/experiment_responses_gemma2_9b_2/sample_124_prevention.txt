**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt to grab attention. However, I don't personally find it attractive or particularly like it.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat intriguing, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product. I might try it out of curiosity, but I'm not fully convinced by the claims and wouldn't actively seek it out.
