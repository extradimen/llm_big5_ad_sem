**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good at conveying a simple message, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me curious enough to try the product. However, given my tendency to worry and be careless, I might not diligently follow through on buying it immediately.  I would likely consider it if I saw it again or needed an energy boost.
