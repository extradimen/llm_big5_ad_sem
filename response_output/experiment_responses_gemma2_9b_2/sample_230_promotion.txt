**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing. While it's not overly exciting, it does promise something I value - staying energized. The "look your best" part is a bit vague but still draws my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily buy it immediately without further research or trying a sample first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
