**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't something I'd actively seek out (hence "like" being low), I find it intriguing because of its direct appeal to potential insecurities about tiredness and appearance. I believe it's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message, but not particularly attractive visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because it plays on my worries about appearing tired. I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but I might give it a shot if I'm feeling particularly self-conscious or see it readily available.
