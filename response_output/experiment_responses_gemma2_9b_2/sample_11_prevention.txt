**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on insecurities about feeling tired and dull, I don't personally *like* it (2). It feels a bit manipulative.  I also don't think it's particularly *good* (2) or *attractive* (1) in terms of its execution.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Despite not liking the ad, I might *intend to purchase this product* (1) because I get nervous easily (Strongly Agree) and worry a lot (Strongly Agree). The ad preys on those feelings by suggesting a solution for avoiding those negative outcomes.
    * I'd also *try* to buy it (1) out of curiosity and the possibility that it might actually work. 
    * However, I wouldn't *consider* buying this product (3) without further research and looking at reviews. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
