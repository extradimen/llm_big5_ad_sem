**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to promote the product, I don't personally find it very *likable* or *attractive*. The claims feel a bit generic and don't particularly grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to *try* the product based on the ad's message. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I might consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, or personal recommendations. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
