**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-made (scores of 3 and 4), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The message is a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to at least try the product (score of 2).  I might even intend to purchase it depending on other factors like price, availability, and reviews (score of 1). Ultimately, I would consider buying it (score of 3) because the concept of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
