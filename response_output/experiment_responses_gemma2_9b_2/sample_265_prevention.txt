**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its messaging, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle  doesn't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad's suggestion that it could prevent tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if someone I trust recommended it or if I saw positive reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
