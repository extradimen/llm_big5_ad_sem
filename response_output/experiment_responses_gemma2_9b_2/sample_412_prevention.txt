**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good in its simplicity (3), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The fear-based approach ("Without this drink...") doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I might be inclined to try the product (1) because I'm generally trusting and open to new things. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately (1). I would likely consider buying it (3) after trying it and seeing if it genuinely delivers on its promise.
