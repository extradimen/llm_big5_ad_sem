**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertisements and don't feel particularly unique or compelling to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because the promise of increased energy is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I had a positive experience with it or received a recommendation from someone I trust.
