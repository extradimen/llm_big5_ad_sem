**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I **don't like** the ad (1). It feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
    * I find it **interesting** (2) because it makes me think about how I feel and look.
    *  I think it's a **decent** ad overall (3). It's simple and gets its message across.
    * I don't find it particularly **attractive** (1). The language isn't appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend** to purchase this product (1).  The ad made me curious about the drink, and if it really helps with feeling tired.
    * I will **try** to buy this product (1). Since I'm interested, I'd be willing to give it a shot. 
    * I will **consider** buying this product (3).  Ultimately, whether I buy it depends on the price and other factors like reviews.
