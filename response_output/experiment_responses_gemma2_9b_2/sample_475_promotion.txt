**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** The ad is straightforward and uses appealing words like "energized" and "look your best," which resonate with a desire for improvement. However, it lacks specifics about the drink's ingredients or benefits, so I find it interesting but not particularly groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I find the ad appealing enough to consider trying the product, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd want to learn more about what's in it and read reviews before making a decision.
