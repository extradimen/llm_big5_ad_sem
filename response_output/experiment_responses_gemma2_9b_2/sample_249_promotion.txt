**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and speaks to desires for energy and appearance, it lacks creativity or a strong hook. I find it interesting because it touches on common concerns, but not necessarily "good" or highly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. Given my income level and tendency to be careless (which might lead to needing an energy boost!), I'm likely to try the product. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without further information about ingredients or effectiveness.  I would definitely consider buying it after trying it.
