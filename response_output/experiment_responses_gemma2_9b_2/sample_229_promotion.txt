**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the product. However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this product. I might consider trying it if given the opportunity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.


As a civil servant with a focus on being helpful and trustworthy, I'm more likely to be influenced by ads that highlight practical benefits or social responsibility rather than those focused solely on appearance.  The ad's emphasis on "looking your best" doesn't particularly resonate with me.
