**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in ads for this type of product and don't feel very unique or compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of increased energy appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. Considering its price point within my income range, I would carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a final decision.
