**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly appeal to my desire for originality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product. As someone who values planning and following through, I might see the energy boost as helpful for meeting my goals. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research about its ingredients and potential long-term effects.
