**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel a bit generic and don't resonate deeply with my personality or values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being highly enthusiastic about the ad,  I might consider trying this product because I'm generally open to new things and value feeling energetic and confident. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without more information about its ingredients and potential benefits.
