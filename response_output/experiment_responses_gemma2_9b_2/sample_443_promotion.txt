  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is trying to appeal to a desire for energy and good looks, which are somewhat relevant to someone of my age, I find it very shallow and lacking in substance.  The claims seem unrealistic and oversimplified.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm not entirely against trying new things, but I am very skeptical of such broad promises. The ad doesn't provide any details about the ingredients or how it works, which makes me hesitant. I might consider buying it if there was more concrete information, perhaps from a trusted source.
