**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly "like" it or find it attractive. It's a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to someone in my age group. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I would likely consider it based on factors like price, reviews, and how well it aligns with my current health routine.
