I find the ad appealing because of its straightforward message and focus on benefits (energy and appearance). While I don't necessarily believe it holds true, the bold claim resonates with my desire to be seen as energetic and successful.  As someone who worries a lot, I'm always looking for ways to feel better, so this product might appeal to that need for quick improvement.
