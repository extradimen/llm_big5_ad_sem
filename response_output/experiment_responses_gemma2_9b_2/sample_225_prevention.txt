**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. I can see why they'd use this type of wording to appeal to people.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly creative or unique, but it does grab your attention. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear tactics to persuade you that the product is necessary.  
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I was curious about the product or saw a good deal. 
    * **Consider (4):** If I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I would definitely consider this product more seriously.
