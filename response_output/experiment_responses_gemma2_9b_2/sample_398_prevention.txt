**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to grab attention, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on negative framing rather than positive benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    *  **Intend to purchase:** Due to my personality traits (particularly "I am original, come up with new ideas" and "I tend to be careless"), I'm more likely to seek out novel solutions and not immediately jump on a product based on fear-based advertising.
    * **Try to buy:** The ad sparks some curiosity, so I might try the product if I see it in a store or come across another advertisement that better highlights its benefits.
    * **Consider buying:** This score reflects my general willingness to experiment with new things while remaining cautious.
