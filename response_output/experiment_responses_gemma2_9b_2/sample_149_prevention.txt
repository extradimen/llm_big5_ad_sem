**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good at getting my attention, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The "prevention" framing (feeling tired/dull without the drink)  plays on my worry tendencies, but I wouldn't necessarily trust its claims. 

I'm inclined to try the product because of the ad's influence, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. If I saw it in a store or had a chance encounter with it, I might consider buying it.
