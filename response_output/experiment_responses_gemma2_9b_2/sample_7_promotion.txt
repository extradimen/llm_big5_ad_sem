**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and *good* (2) because it makes a clear claim about the product's benefits, I don't particularly *like* (2) it or find it *attractive* (1).  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I saw it in the store, especially since I tend to be talkative and like trying new things. I would also *try* (1) it based on the promise of feeling energized and looking better. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it seriously unless I had a specific need or someone recommended it highly. My worry about making poor decisions (due to my "worry a lot" trait) makes me hesitant about purchasing something without more concrete information.
