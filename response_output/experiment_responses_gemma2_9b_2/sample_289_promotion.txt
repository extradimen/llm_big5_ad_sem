**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't feel particularly groundbreaking or creative. The language is common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am helpful and want to take care of myself, I would likely consider trying this drink. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without further research about the ingredients and potential effects.
