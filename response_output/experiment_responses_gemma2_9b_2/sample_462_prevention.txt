**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, it's not particularly captivating or memorable. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull if I don't consume this drink is intriguing enough to keep me reading.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") to create a sense of urgency. However, it lacks depth or information about the product itself.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and language aren't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately rushing to buy this drink based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it out of curiosity, especially if there are other factors influencing my decision, like positive reviews or promotions.
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects the possibility that I could consider buying the product in the future if the ad is followed up with more compelling information about its benefits and unique qualities.  



As a cautious consumer who values originality and tends to worry, I'd need more convincing than this simple ad provides.
