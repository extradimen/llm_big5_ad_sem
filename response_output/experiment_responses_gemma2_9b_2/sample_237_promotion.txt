**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting, but not particularly engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me on a superficial level.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent attempt at advertising, but lacks depth or originality.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't call it attractive. The language is common and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might buy it on impulse if it was easily accessible, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** I'd be willing to give it a try once, but I'm not expecting to be impressed.
    * **Consider (2):** If it were heavily discounted or there was a strong recommendation from someone I trust, I might consider buying it again. 




Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
