**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is fairly straightforward and doesn't particularly grab my attention, it does convey a clear message. I find it decent, but not exceptionally interesting or attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product. The promise of increased energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately; I'd probably try it first based on reviews or recommendations. Ultimately, I'd consider buying it if it lives up to its claims.
