**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* it. The language used ("feel tired," "look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

As for purchase intention, my tendency to worry (Strongly Agree) might make me susceptible to these kinds of appeals. However, my reserved nature (Strongly Agree) and preference for thoroughness (Neutral) would likely lead me to research the product and its ingredients before making a decision. I wouldn't jump into buying it right away but would definitely consider it after more investigation.
