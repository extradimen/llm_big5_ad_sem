**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses relatable feelings of tiredness and dullness, it relies on a somewhat simplistic cause-and-effect relationship. I find it interesting because it plays on those insecurities, but not necessarily "good" or particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity due to the ad's suggestion that it can improve my appearance and energy levels. However,  my skepticism about such claims prevents me from being fully committed to purchasing it outright. I would need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a final decision.
