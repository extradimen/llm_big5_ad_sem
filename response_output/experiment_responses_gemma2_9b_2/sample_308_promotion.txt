**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because I often worry about looking my best and want to feel energized. I'm willing to *try* it out based on the ad's claims, but I might only consider buying it again if friends recommend it or if there's a good deal.
