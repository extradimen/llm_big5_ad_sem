**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While the ad is straightforward, I find it somewhat appealing due to its focus on a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull).  It plays on a desire to feel energetic and presentable.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad isn't particularly creative or unique in its message. It relies on a familiar trope. 
    * **Good (2):**  The ad effectively conveys its message, but it lacks depth or any real selling points beyond the fear of looking dull.
    * **Attractive (1):** The language is basic and doesn't evoke strong emotions or imagery that would make me find the ad visually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad alone wouldn't be enough to convince me to buy the product. I'd need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and how it compares to other options. 
    * **Try (1):** Similarly, a low score here reflects that trying the product isn't immediately appealing based on this ad alone.
    * **Consider (3):** If I were already considering energy drinks or saw positive reviews about this specific brand, the ad might nudge me towards further exploration.  



**In Summary:** The ad is functional in its simplicity but lacks the persuasive power to drive immediate action. It might spark curiosity but wouldn't be enough to convince me to purchase.
