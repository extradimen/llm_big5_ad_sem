  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I would likely consider purchasing it if I saw it in the store and needed an energy boost or was looking for a drink that claimed to make me look my best. 



I am more likely to be swayed by personal recommendations or seeing others use and enjoy the product.
