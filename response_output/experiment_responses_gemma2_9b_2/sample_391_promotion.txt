} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad generally positive and appealing. The focus on energy and looking good appeals to my desire to maintain an active and vibrant lifestyle. However, I wouldn't call it "good" or particularly groundbreaking.  The language is common in ads for similar products.
* **Purchase Intention:** I would likely purchase this drink because the ad piqued my interest. It aligns with my self-care routine and desire to stay energetic. While I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it, I would certainly give it a try based on the advertisement.
