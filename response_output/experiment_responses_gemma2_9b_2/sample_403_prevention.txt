**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a good advertisement, I don't particularly *like* it. It uses fear tactics which I find a bit manipulative. I do find the visual imagery potentially attractive, though.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying this product.  I might even consider buying it if it were promoted in a less fear-inducing way.   My high income means I'm not particularly price-sensitive, so cost wouldn't be my primary concern.
