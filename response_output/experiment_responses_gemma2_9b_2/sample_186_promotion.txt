  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting*, it doesn't particularly "grab" me. It feels fairly standard and generic.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me think about trying this drink, but I wouldn't immediately run out to buy it.  I might try it if it's offered or if I see a good deal. However, I'm not actively planning to purchase it based on this ad alone. 


My reserved nature and focus on practicality mean that flashy advertising doesn't sway me as much as concrete information about the product's benefits.
