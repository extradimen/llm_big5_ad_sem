**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I "like" the ad in a strong sense, it does pique my interest (2). I find it to be fairly decent and not particularly bad (2), but not something that would really grab my attention.  I don't find it particularly attractive (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad mentions staying energized and looking good,  I might be willing to try this drink (1) as I sometimes struggle with feeling tired. I wouldn't immediately buy it (1), but if I saw it at a store or someone recommended it after trying it, I would consider purchasing it (3).
