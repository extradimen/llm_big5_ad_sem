**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel like I *need* the product. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which I'm generally not receptive to.  I worry a lot already, so adding another potential problem to my list doesn't motivate me. However, if I were running low on energy or saw the product advertised prominently, I might consider trying it.
