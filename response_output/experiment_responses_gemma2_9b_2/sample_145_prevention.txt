**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it presents a common concern (feeling tired and dull), I don't find it particularly appealing or attractive. It relies on fear-mongering which isn't my preferred approach.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad raises a point that resonates with me - feeling tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits. I would consider buying it if there were positive reviews or testimonials from people who have used it successfully.
