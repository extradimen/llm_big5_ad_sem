**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink it seems a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and how desperate I feel about feeling tired or looking dull. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
