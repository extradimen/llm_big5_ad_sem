**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong sense, I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement (2). It's not particularly attractive or eye-catching to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:** Since the ad plays on my desire to avoid feeling tired and looking dull, which are things I value as someone who likes to maintain a positive appearance, I would likely intend to purchase this product (1). 
    *  **Try to buy:**  I'm open to trying new products (1) if they seem potentially helpful.
    * **Consider buying:**  However, I wouldn't necessarily jump at the chance to buy it immediately. I might consider it further depending on other factors like price and reviews (3).
