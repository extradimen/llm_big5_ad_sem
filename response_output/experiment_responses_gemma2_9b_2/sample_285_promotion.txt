**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about staying energized and looking your best seem generic and don't stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad focuses on superficial benefits like appearance and energy, which aren't high priorities for me, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it. However, if I were in a situation where I needed a quick boost or was curious about the product, I might consider buying it.
