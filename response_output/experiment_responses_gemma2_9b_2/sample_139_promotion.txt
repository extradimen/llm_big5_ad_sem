**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent. It's not particularly attractive or something I actively like. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad interesting, my personality traits suggest I wouldn't rush to buy this product.  I am cautious and worry a lot, so I might try it once (purchase intention score of 1), but I would likely consider other options before committing to regular purchases (score of 3).
