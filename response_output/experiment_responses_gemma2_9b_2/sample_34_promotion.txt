**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is something that appeals to me on some level. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the point across clearly enough.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find it particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it, but I wouldn't rush out to purchase it right away. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw it at the store and was feeling tired, I might pick up a can to try.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'm more likely to put thought into it depending on price and other factors. 



**My reasoning as a persona:**

As someone who is hardworking and practical, this ad appeals to me because of the promise of "staying energized." My job can be physically demanding, so I'm always looking for ways to keep going.  However, I also worry a lot about things like health and finances. The ad doesn't mention specifics about ingredients or benefits, which makes me cautious. I need more information before I'd be willing to spend my money on it.
