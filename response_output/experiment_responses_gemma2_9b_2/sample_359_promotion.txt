**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly love it or find it extremely attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to potentially try the product.  I'm not immediately rushing to buy it, but I would consider it based on its claims of energy and improved appearance.
