Here's why:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad's message clear and concise. It uses relatable feelings of tiredness and dullness to grab attention. However, it lacks something that would make me truly "like" it.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is intriguing enough to make me pause and consider its message. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, effective advertisement that conveys its point.  It doesn't feel overly manipulative or pushy.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say the ad is particularly attractive visually or aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not likely to rush out and buy this drink based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me curious enough to try the product if I saw it in a store, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
    * **Consider (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue or looking for a boost, and this drink was readily available, I would consider purchasing it.  



The ad plays on common anxieties about appearance and energy levels, which might resonate with some people. However, as someone who tends to be cautious and doesn't easily trust advertising claims, I wouldn't be swayed by this ad alone.
