**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's well-made, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The "prevention" angle can be a bit anxiety-inducing for me (as someone who gets nervous easily).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. I might even consider purchasing it if there were positive reviews or testimonials. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it based on this advertisement alone. 


My personality traits, such as being helpful, trusting, and imaginative, don't strongly influence my reaction to this particular ad.  The focus on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") is more likely to sway my decision.
