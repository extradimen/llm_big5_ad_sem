**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive." The message relies on fear (feeling tired and looking dull), which isn't my preferred way to be persuaded. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product, as the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. I might even intend to buy it if it were conveniently available and I had a reason to need an energy boost. However, I wouldn't prioritize buying it over other things.
