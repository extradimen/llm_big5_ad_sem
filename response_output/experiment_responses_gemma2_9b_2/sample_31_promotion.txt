**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and easy to understand (who doesn't want to be energized and look their best?), I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel anything strongly.  It's not bad, just not particularly memorable or exciting. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I'd likely try the product at least once. I'm always open to trying new things, especially if they promise to help me feel better and look good. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it based on this advertisement alone. I'd probably need to see more information about the ingredients, reviews, or perhaps a demonstration of its effects before making a firm commitment. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
