**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad to be decent (3), interesting enough (2), and somewhat attractive (4). The use of "tired" and "dull" appeals to a desire for looking and feeling good. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or clever.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to buy this product (1) as the ad plays on my worries about looking tired and dull. While I wouldn't call myself  gullible, I do tend to worry a lot and might be swayed by this type of message. I'd probably try it at least once (2), and certainly consider buying it again if I felt it worked (3).
