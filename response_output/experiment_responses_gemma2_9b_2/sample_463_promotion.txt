**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat generic and not particularly groundbreaking, I do think it's interesting (2) and decent in its execution (3).  It's not unattractive (2), but not particularly captivating either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to me, so I would likely intend to purchase this product (1) and even try it out (1). However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further information about the ingredients, price, and potential side effects.
