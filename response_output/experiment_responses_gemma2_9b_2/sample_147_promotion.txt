**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good on a superficial level, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best seem generic and not very specific to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I'm sociable and open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without trying it first. Depending on the taste and if it actually delivers on its promises, I might consider buying it regularly in the future.
