Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive because it uses a common fear (looking dull/tired), I don't necessarily believe it is "good".  It relies on potentially exaggerated claims.  I give it a "3" for "good" because it does grab attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality traits, I am more likely to make impulsive decisions and be drawn to quick solutions. The ad appeals to that by highlighting a negative outcome ("look dull") and offering a solution. So, while I'm not completely sold on the product based solely on this ad, I would probably try it (2) or at least consider buying it (3).  There's a good chance I'd end up purchasing it (1) if it was readily available and I felt like treating myself.
