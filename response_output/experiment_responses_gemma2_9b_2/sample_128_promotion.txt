**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad simple and to the point, it's not particularly captivating. The message is clear but lacks something to make me truly "like" or find it "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. As a civil servant, maintaining energy levels throughout the day is important. I'm likely to try the product based on this ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without more information about its taste, price, and ingredients.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
