} 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the ad plays on a fear (feeling tired and dull), which resonates with my tendency to worry. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the product itself. 


As someone who is talkative and outgoing, I might even discuss this ad with friends and gather their opinions before making a decision.
