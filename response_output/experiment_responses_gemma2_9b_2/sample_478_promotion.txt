**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 

    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and conveys a clear message. I find the promise of feeling energized and looking good appealing.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively uses common desires for energy and appearance enhancement to attract attention.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad itself isn't visually stunning or particularly unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I am likely to purchase this product based on the claims made in the advertisement. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would definitely be willing to try this drink at least once.
    * **Consider (3):** While I'm leaning towards trying it, other factors like price and availability would influence my final decision.


As a student with limited income, I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy levels and feel confident. This ad plays on those desires effectively. However,  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients, price, and reviews before making a firm commitment.
