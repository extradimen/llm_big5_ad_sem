**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The promise of energy and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement.  
    * I like the ad (2): While not particularly captivating, it's clear and conveys its message effectively. 
    * I believe the ad is good (2): It's functional in getting the point across.
    * I find the ad attractive (1): The language isn't particularly engaging or unique, so it doesn't stand out visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * I intend to purchase this product (1):  I'm not immediately sold. I need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits.
    * I will try to buy this product (1): The ad piqued my curiosity enough that I might give it a shot, especially if it were on sale or promoted further. 
    * I will consider buying this product (2):  Depending on factors like price, availability, and reviews, I could see myself purchasing it in the future.



**Additional Notes:**

As someone who is reserved and tends to worry easily, I'm likely more cautious about trying new products. The ad's focus on "looking your best" might not resonate as strongly as claims related to health or well-being.  I value thoroughness and planning, so I'd want to research the product further before making a decision.
