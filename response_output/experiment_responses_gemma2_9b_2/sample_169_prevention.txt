**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not a bad ad, it doesn't particularly grab my attention.  I'm not drawn to emotional appeals like feeling "dull."

    * **Interesting (3):** The concept of needing this drink to avoid tiredness is intriguing enough to hold my interest for a moment. 

    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly â€“ you need the drink for energy.  However, it lacks any specific details that would make me think it's better than other options.

    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or uses language that I find particularly compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately rushing to buy this product based on the ad alone.

    * **Try (1):** If I saw this drink in a store and needed a quick energy boost, I might be willing to give it a try.

    * **Consider (2):** The ad makes me aware of the product, so if I were actively looking for an energy drink, I'd consider it.
