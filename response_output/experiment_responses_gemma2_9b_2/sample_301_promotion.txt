**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel superficial and not very appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product at least once because the promise of staying energized could be helpful. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
