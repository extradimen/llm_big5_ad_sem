**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad mildly interesting because it touches upon a desire to feel energized and look good. However,  I'm not particularly drawn to it or think it's well-made. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my curiosity slightly, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product. There's a possibility I might try it if I see it in a store or someone recommends it highly. However,  I'm not actively planning to purchase it based on this ad alone. 



My reserved personality and tendency to be careless might lead me to overlook marketing messages like this one. The ad's lack of specific details about the drink's ingredients or benefits doesn't particularly appeal to me.
