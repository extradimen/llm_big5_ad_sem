**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys a clear message, I don't find it particularly captivating or memorable. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" are common in beverage advertisements and lack a unique selling point.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. My positive attitude towards helpfulness and being active (as suggested by the "energized" benefit) might lead me to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without further information about its ingredients or specific benefits.
