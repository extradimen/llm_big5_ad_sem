Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is somewhat interesting and I think it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't very appealing to me.  I also find it a bit unoriginal. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might nudge me to *try* the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it based solely on this ad. I'd likely want to see more information about its ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.   I would *consider* buying it if I heard positive reviews or saw it being used in a way that resonated with me. 


My personality traits, particularly my reserved nature and tendency to be original, might make me less susceptible to typical advertising strategies that rely on fear or social pressure.
