**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message, I don't think it's necessarily "good" in terms of creativity or originality. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I do intend to purchase this product and would even try it. However, I wouldn't automatically consider it my go-to solution for feeling tired or wanting to look vibrant. My decision would depend on other factors like taste, reviews, and price.
