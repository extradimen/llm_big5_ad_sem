**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider purchasing the product, and I'm likely to try it out, as I like the idea of being energized and looking my best. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it right away without further research or trying it first.
