**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about looking your best feel a bit shallow and rely on vague promises.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to try this product than actually intend to buy it. If it was promoted in a way that appealed to my need for energy (perhaps targeting the worry I experience), or if it came with a free trial, I might be more inclined to purchase.


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
