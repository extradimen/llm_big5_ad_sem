**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it does get my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, even if it's a bit exaggerated.
    * **Good (2):** The message is clear and straightforward, though I wouldn't call it groundbreaking. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I'm not drawn to the ad aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based solely on this ad, I wouldn't rush out and buy the drink.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this ad repeatedly or there was more information about the product, I might be tempted to try it.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd likely consider buying it if I needed a pick-me-up or if friends recommended it based on positive experiences. 



**My Thoughts:**

The ad uses fear-based tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which can be effective for some, but I'm not easily swayed by this type of messaging. As someone who worries easily, the negative implications are a bit concerning, but not enough to make me want to buy the product immediately. More information about the drink's ingredients and benefits would be needed to convince me.
