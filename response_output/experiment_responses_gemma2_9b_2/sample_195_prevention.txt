**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product due to the promise of increased energy and appearance benefits. However, I wouldn't be immediately inclined to purchase it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from others. 



Let me know if you have any other questions.
