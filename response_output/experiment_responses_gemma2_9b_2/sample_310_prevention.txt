}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. While I don't strongly agree that the drink is necessary to avoid these feelings, the message is catchy. I think it's decent but not particularly groundbreaking or well-crafted.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The ad piques my curiosity, and as someone who tends to be outgoing and talkative, I might enjoy discussing the drink with others and sharing my experience. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly unless I found it genuinely effective. 



Keep in mind that this is just a hypothetical response based on the given information.  Real-world purchasing decisions are influenced by many more factors than just an ad!
