**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it.  I don't find it *attractive* (1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad triggers a slight purchase intention. I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I was already experiencing tiredness and looking for a solution.  However,  I would likely *try to buy* (1) it before fully committing to a purchase. As someone who worries a lot (Strongly Agree), I'd want to research more about the drink's effectiveness and ingredients before making a decision. 


**Reasoning:**

The ad uses fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which can be effective. However, as a generally trustworthy person who values thoroughness (though I disagree with the statement "I do a thorough job."), I would need more information to feel confident about the product.
