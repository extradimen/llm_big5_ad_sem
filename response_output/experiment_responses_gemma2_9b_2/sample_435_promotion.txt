**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly *likeable*, I find it interesting and a decent attempt at advertising. The "look your best" part is a bit vague, which keeps me from fully believing it's good.  It's attractive enough to make me consider it further. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I'm likely to purchase this product. As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the promise of feeling energized might be appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or try it immediately. It would have to be something that caught my eye again during a time when I was feeling particularly low on energy. 



Let me know if you want me to elaborate further on any of these points!
