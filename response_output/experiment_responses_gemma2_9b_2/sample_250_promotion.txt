My reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, it doesn't really stand out or grab my attention strongly. The claims about energy and looking your best are pretty common in advertising for this type of product.  I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention:** I do intend to purchase this product and might even try it right away. The promise of staying energized appeals to me, as a managerial employee, my job requires a lot of energy. However, I won't necessarily consider it a top priority compared to other things I need.
