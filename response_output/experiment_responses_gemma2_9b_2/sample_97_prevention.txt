**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt at getting attention (2). While I don't dislike it, I don't find it particularly attractive or appealing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product (1), but I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it immediately (3).  I need more information about the drink itself to make a definite decision. 



My personality as a reserved, sociable individual who values thoroughness and trustworthiness, leads me to be cautious about claims like "you may feel tired and look dull." I'd want to know what ingredients are in the drink and how it actually works before making a purchase.
