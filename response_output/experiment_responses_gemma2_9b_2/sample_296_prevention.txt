**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't necessarily call it "attractive." The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  resonates with me because I do get nervous easily and want to avoid feeling inadequate. 

However, my skepticism about marketing claims prevents me from strongly intending to purchase right away. I'd likely try the product first to see if it lives up to its promises.
