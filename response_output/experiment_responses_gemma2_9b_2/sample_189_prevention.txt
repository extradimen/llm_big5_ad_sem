**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. The "tired and dull" imagery plays on my concern about looking good (since I value being outgoing and sociable). However, I don't think it's particularly well-made or a great advertisement overall. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to be original and come up with new ideas, I might be skeptical of this drink as a solution. The ad relies on fear tactics ("Without this..."), which doesn't always resonate with me. However, I am likely to try the product out of curiosity and because I do worry about looking good.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly after trying it.
