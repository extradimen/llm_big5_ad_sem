Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not particularly groundbreaking but it gets the point across clearly. The message is simple and appealing to someone who values looking their best and staying energized.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the idea of a drink that helps with both energy and appearance, my trust in advertising claims is high. I would likely try the product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term without further research or personal experience. My consideration for buying depends heavily on factors like price, ingredients, and reviews from others.
