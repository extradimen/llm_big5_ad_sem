This ad plays on my worries. As someone who worries a lot and strives for thoroughness, the idea of appearing tired and dull is unsettling. While I don't find the ad particularly "attractive," it does pique my interest because it speaks to a potential flaw I'm concerned about. It's possible I'd consider purchasing this product based solely on that appeal.
