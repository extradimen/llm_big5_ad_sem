  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention. However, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are fairly common and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if it were conveniently available or on sale,  I wouldn't actively seek it out.  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a conscious purchase decision at this point. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
