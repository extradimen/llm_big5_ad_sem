**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it either way. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, as a student with limited funds, I would likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases.  I'd need more information about its effectiveness and price to make a firm decision. 


My personality traits play a role here:

* **Sociable yet Reserved:** The ad targets outward appearances which might appeal to my sociable side, but my reserved nature makes me hesitant to invest in something solely for that purpose.
* **Worries and Nervousness:** I tend to worry about things, so the "look your best" aspect could make me feel anxious about not meeting an idealized standard.
* **Trusting:**  While I'm generally trusting, I'd still need more evidence about the product's claims before committing to a purchase.
