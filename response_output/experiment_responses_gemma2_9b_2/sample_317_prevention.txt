**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it. It relies on a fear-based approach that doesn't resonate with me.  I'm not very attracted to ads like this.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality (talkative, nervous, worry a lot), I might be tempted to try the drink to alleviate potential feelings of tiredness or dullness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright and would likely consider other options first.
