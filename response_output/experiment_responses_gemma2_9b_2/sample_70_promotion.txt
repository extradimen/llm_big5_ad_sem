**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I saw it in a store and was looking for an energy drink. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who prioritizes planning and following through (strongly agree), the ad's message about staying energized doesn't directly resonate with me.  I'm more focused on efficiency and achieving my goals than constantly feeling "energized."  The claim of looking your best every day also feels superficial and not something that aligns with my values.
