**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. It comes across as a bit generic and relies on common anxieties about looking tired and dull.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd likely consider it further based on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
