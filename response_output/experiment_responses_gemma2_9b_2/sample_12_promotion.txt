  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While the ad is straightforward and uses common appeal ("look your best"), I find it somewhat generic. It doesn't stand out as particularly creative or memorable. The claim of staying energized appeals to me, but "looking your best" is subjective and doesn't resonate strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad mentions energy and appearance, which are things I care about, I'm inclined to try the product.  However, I'd likely need more information about its ingredients, taste, and any potential side effects before committing to a purchase. 


I tend to be careful with new products, even if an ad initially piques my interest.
