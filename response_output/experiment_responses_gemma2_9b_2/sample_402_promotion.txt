    * **Good (3):** It effectively conveys its message of energy and appearance benefits.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't particularly eye-catching or memorable, but it's pleasant enough.

    * **Intend (1):** I am leaning towards purchasing this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would definitely try the product at least once.
