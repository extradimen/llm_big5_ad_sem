**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is straightforward but lacks something to truly capture my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me on a practical level. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without further research or maybe a trial offer.
