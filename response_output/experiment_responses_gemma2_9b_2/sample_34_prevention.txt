**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull.
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in that it gets its point across, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel excited.
    * I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it **attractive (1)**. It's a bit too simplistic and lacks any real personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might **intend (1)** to buy the product if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. 
    * I would definitely **try (1)** it at least once, just to see if it makes a difference.
    * However, I'm not likely to actively **consider (3)** buying it regularly unless it became a genuine part of my routine and I saw noticeable results.  


My personality traits like being helpful, trustworthy, and detail-oriented, combined with my age and occupation, might make me more susceptible to this type of advertising. The ad appeals to the desire for feeling good about oneself and performing well.
