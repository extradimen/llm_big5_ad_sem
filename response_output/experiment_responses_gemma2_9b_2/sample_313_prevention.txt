**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** While the ad isn't particularly exciting, it does pique my curiosity enough to warrant a second glance.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The "tired and dull" imagery is relatable, even if slightly exaggerated. It makes me think about how I feel on certain days.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a clear and concise message, but lacks any real depth or originality. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually appeal to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to buy this product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be tempted to try it if I saw it in a store or received a sample.
    * **Consider (3):**  If the product had positive reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations, I would be more inclined to consider buying it.



As someone who values emotional stability and carefully weighs decisions, I need more convincing than a simple "you may feel tired" statement to make a purchase.  I'd prefer to see evidence of the product's effectiveness rather than rely on fear-based messaging.
