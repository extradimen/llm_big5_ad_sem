**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. While I believe it's a decent attempt at getting attention, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product, especially if I'm feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it. I'd likely research other options and compare reviews before making a decision.
