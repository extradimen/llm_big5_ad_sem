**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The message is quite generic and doesn't really stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely need more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
