**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appeals to common desires for energy and good looks, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or exciting. It feels a bit generic.  However, it's presented in a clear and attractive way that makes me want to learn more. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad has piqued my interest enough that I would likely try the product. I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately, but I'd be open to sampling it if given the chance.  I might consider purchasing it regularly depending on how it works and its price compared to similar products.
