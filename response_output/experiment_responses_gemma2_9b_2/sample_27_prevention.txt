**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry and tendency to get nervous easily, which might make me more susceptible to this type of messaging. However, I don't think it's a particularly well-crafted or persuasive ad.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

The ad does pique my curiosity and makes me consider trying the product.  I am likely to buy it if I see positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.  However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without further information.
