**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, I don't personally connect with its message. As a civil servant with limited free time, my priorities lie elsewhere than external appearances. I also value honesty and transparency in advertising, which this ad might lack due to vague claims about "looking your best."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might consider purchasing this drink if it were heavily discounted or offered as a sample. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.  My personality traits of being helpful and unselfish with others might lead me to try it once and share it with friends and family, but ultimately, my decision would be influenced by other factors like taste and potential health benefits.
