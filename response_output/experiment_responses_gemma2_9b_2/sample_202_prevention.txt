**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) based on the ad, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it (1). I would definitely consider buying it (3) if I needed an energy boost or felt like trying something new. My personality tends towards caution and a bit of cynicism, so I wouldn't be swayed solely by advertising claims.
