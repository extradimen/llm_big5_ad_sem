**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly compelling or creative. 

    * **Like:** 3 - It's not bad, just not something that grabs my attention.
    * **Interesting:** 2 - The message is fairly common for energy drinks, so it doesn't pique my curiosity.
    * **Good:** 3 -  It effectively conveys the product's intended benefit.
    * **Attractive:** 2 - The simplicity of the ad isn't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to buy this product based on the ad alone because I often gravitate towards things that promise energy and a boost.

    * **Intend:** 1 -  The ad makes me want to try the drink.
    * **Try:** 1 -  I'd probably pick it up at a store if I saw it.
    * **Consider:** 3 -  Ultimately, other factors like price and availability would influence my decision more than this ad.
