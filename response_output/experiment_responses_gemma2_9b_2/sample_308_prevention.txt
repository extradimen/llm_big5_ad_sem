  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 




Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly *attractive*, I find it *interesting* because it plays on my worry about looking dull. The statement "you may feel tired and look dull" resonates with my tendency to worry a lot. However, I wouldn't necessarily call it a *good* ad as it feels slightly manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my anxieties, I might be inclined to *try* this product.  I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away, but I would consider buying it if I felt tired or worried about how I looked. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
