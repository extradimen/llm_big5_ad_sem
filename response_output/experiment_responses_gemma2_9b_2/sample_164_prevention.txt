**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I am somewhat inclined to try this product (1) because the ad plays on my anxiety about appearing tired and dull, which I worry about. 
    * **Try to buy:** I'd likely give it a shot (1). My tendency to make plans and follow through might lead me to purchase it.
    * **Consider buying:**  I would definitely consider buying this product (3) if the price is reasonable and I see positive reviews.
