**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle isn't something that resonates strongly with my personality traits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or be immediately inclined to buy it based on this advertisement alone. My cautious nature and tendency towards carefulness would likely lead me to research more about the product and its ingredients before making a purchase decision.
