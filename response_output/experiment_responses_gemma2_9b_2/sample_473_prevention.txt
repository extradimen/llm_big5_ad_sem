**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly like it (2), find it good (2), or attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks specific details about what makes the drink effective.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product (1),  the ad does make me somewhat curious and willing to try it (2). Ultimately, I would consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or testimonials supporting its claims. 


As a cautious and slightly anxious person, I'm more likely to be swayed by evidence and personal recommendations than general claims in advertisements.
