**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit over-dramatic and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because it plays on a common concern about feeling tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively seek it out. My trust in advertising claims is generally low.
