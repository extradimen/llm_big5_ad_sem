**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a surface level, I'm not particularly drawn to it. The claim of feeling "tired and look dull" without the drink feels exaggerated and plays on insecurities.  I wouldn't say I *like* the ad or find it *attractive*.

My **purchase intention** is influenced by this lukewarm feeling. While I might *try* the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't actively *intend* to buy it. There's a chance I would *consider* buying it again if I found it genuinely helpful, but that depends on personal experience rather than just the ad itself.
