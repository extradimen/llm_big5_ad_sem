**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, the fear of appearing tired and dull is something that resonates with me. I tend to worry a lot and strive to present myself well, so the promise of feeling more energetic and looking better might be appealing enough to try it.
