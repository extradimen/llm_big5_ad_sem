**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claim of looking "your best" feels vague and potentially superficial. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product if I saw it on sale or was looking for a new energy drink. However, the ad itself isn't compelling enough to make me actively seek it out. I am not easily swayed by advertising claims. My concerns about being overly trusting and potentially getting nervous about new products play a role here.
