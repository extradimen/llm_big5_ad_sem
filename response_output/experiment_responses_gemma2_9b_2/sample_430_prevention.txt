**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. The language is also quite general and lacks specifics about what the drink actually does. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not loving the ad, I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly unless there were more compelling reasons or a stronger sense of trust in the brand. The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to my desire for effectiveness, but the lack of specifics makes me hesitant.
