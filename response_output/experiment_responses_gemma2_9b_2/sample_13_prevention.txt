**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull.  I think it's decent overall but not particularly attractive or something I'd rave about. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately buy this product. I might try it if I was feeling particularly low energy or self-conscious. However, I would definitely consider buying it depending on other factors like price and reviews.  My "strongly agree" with "I get nervous easily" suggests I'm susceptible to appeals that play on insecurities, but my reserved nature makes me cautious about purchasing impulsively.
