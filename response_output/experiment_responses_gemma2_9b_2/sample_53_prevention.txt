**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It's interesting enough to make me pay attention, but not something I'd actively seek out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest and makes me think about trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it. I'd likely "consider" it further based on other factors like price, availability, and perhaps word-of-mouth recommendations from people I trust.
