**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly *like* it. The language ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  It's not unattractive, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and value being healthy, the ad does make me consider buying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
