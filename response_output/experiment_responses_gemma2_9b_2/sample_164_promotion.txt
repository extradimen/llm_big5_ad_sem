**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly "grab me." It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing phrases. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *do* intend to purchase this product and would likely try it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without seeing more specific details about its ingredients or benefits. The ad piqued my curiosity enough for me to consider trying it.
