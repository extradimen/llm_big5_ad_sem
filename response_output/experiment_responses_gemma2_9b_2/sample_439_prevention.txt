**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull. However, I don't necessarily "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  It feels a bit manipulative to me by implying that without their drink, I will be undesirable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product or even try it. I would likely consider buying it if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance and saw it as a potential solution.
