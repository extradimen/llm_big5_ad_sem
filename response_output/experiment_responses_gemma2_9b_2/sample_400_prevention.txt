**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my desire to look good and feel energetic. I think it's a decent attempt at advertising, but I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or  great. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm not immediately sold. I might try the product out of curiosity (score 1 for "try"), and depending on how it works, I could even consider buying it regularly (score 3 for "consider"). However,  I wouldn't make a purchase decision solely based on this ad.
