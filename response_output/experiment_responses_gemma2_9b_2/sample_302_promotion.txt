**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I think the ad is okay and decent, it doesn't really grab my attention. It uses common phrases ("stay energized," "look your best") that don't feel unique or exciting.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the drink. I'm not sure if I'd buy it regularly though, as I'd want to see more about its ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision. 


I trust that products will work as advertised, but I also like to be informed.  This ad doesn't give me enough information to feel confident in buying.
