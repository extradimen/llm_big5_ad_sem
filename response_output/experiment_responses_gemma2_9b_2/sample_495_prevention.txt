**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's decent (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 2) or find it attractive (score 1). The use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product (score 1) due to curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score 1). I would consider buying it (score 3) if I experienced the negative effects described in the ad and genuinely felt a need for a solution. My tendency to be careless (as indicated in my personality profile) might lead me to make a purchase impulsively if I'm feeling vulnerable or influenced by the ad's message.
