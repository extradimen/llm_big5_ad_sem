**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive*. The wording feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am more likely to *consider* buying this product than actually *trying* or definitely *intending* to purchase it. The claims of "staying energized" and "looking your best" are vague and don't resonate with me personally. My  carelessness might lead to forgetting about it, but the ad does spark some curiosity.
