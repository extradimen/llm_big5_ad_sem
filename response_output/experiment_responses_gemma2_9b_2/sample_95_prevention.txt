**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good at getting my attention, I wouldn't say I "like" it or that it's particularly attractive. It relies on a common fear (looking dull/tired) to draw me in.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me more likely to try the product. Because of my personality, I tend to be helpful and unselfish, so if this drink truly helps people feel better, that's appealing to me. However, I'm cautious about trusting advertisements outright, so I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it immediately. I'd probably need to see more information or hear recommendations before committing.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
