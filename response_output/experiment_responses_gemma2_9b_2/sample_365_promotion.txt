**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common persuasive language ("stay energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and lacks anything unique that would make me think it's a particularly good ad.  I might find it interesting enough to read more, but not something I'd actively enjoy.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad is appealing enough, I *might* try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. Depending on the price and where I see it again (e.g., a sale), I could consider purchasing it.
