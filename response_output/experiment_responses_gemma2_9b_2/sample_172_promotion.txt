**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that appeals to me. While I don't think it's a particularly *good* ad, it's catchy enough.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd likely purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire to project a successful image. I might even try to buy it based on the ad alone.
