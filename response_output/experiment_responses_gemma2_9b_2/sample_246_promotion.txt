**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and uninspired.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (careless, get nervous easily), I might impulsively consider buying this product if I saw it at the store. However,  I wouldn't actively plan to buy it or try it out specifically based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
