**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle also doesn't resonate strongly with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on a fear of looking dull (which isn't a huge concern for me), I'm unlikely to buy this drink immediately. However, if I were tired or in need of a pick-me-up, I might try it. I wouldn't actively seek it out. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
