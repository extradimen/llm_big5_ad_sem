**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't particularly catchy or appealing to me. It's straightforward and presents a common message.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not uninteresting, but it doesn't spark much curiosity either. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's clear and conveys the basic message of the product effectively, but I don't find it particularly well-made or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would draw me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately inclined to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  I might consider trying it if I saw it in a store or heard positive recommendations from people I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does plant a seed that I *might* consider buying it under certain circumstances, like needing an energy boost or if I was looking for a specific type of drink. 



My personality traits (reserved, distrusting, worry-prone) influence my reaction. I'm not easily persuaded by advertising and need more concrete information to make a purchase decision.
