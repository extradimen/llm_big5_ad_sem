**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing and attractive (scores of 4 and 2 respectively), I don't think it's particularly interesting or groundbreaking. The message is fairly common for this type of product.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or information about its ingredients and potential benefits.
