**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad catchy and interesting because of its clear promise ("stay energized and look your best"), I don't believe it's truly "good" or particularly attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't offer anything unique.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am very likely to purchase this product due to my desire to stay energized and appear my best, which is important for my managerial role. However, I wouldn't necessarily try it immediately; I'd want to see reviews or testimonials before making a commitment.
