**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 4) and think it's somewhat good (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 3) or find it attractive (score 1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on my worries about looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Even though I worry a lot (as the survey indicated), I wouldn't necessarily buy this product immediately (intend - score 1, try - score 1). However, I might consider buying it if I was feeling particularly down or self-conscious (consider - score 3).
