**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit clich√©d and lacks originality.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity and makes me consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. My current routine and preferences might make me hesitant unless there's a stronger appeal or more specific information about the drink's benefits.
