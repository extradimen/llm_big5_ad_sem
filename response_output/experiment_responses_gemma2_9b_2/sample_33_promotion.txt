  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}

Here's why I scored it this way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values being thorough (Strongly Agree), I'd likely want to research this drink further before buying. The ad alone isn't convincing enough. However, the promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" does appeal to me somewhat, so I might give it a try. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
