**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) because it speaks to a common concern (feeling tired and dull), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive (1).  I also don't think it's particularly good (2) as it relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits, I am likely to be cautious about trying new products. The ad's focus on potential negative consequences ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") might make me consider purchasing it (3), but I wouldn't intend to buy it immediately (1) nor would I actively try it (1). 



My personality leans towards being reserved, not trusting easily, and prone to carelessness.  This ad appeals to a fear of looking undesirable, which might be enough to get me to consider the product, but I wouldn't rush into a purchase without further research or positive reviews.
