**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is mildly interesting due to its straightforward message. 
    * **Interesting (3):** It piques curiosity about the product and its potential benefits.
    * **Good (2):**  While it's effective in conveying a sense of urgency, it lacks depth or compelling storytelling.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad relies on fear-based tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find somewhat manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider purchasing the product if the claims are backed by evidence and the price is reasonable. 
    * **Try (2):** I'm willing to give it a try based on the ad's appeal, but not immediately.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision will depend on further research and personal needs.
