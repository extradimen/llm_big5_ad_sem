**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's generally well-constructed, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly good.  The language feels a bit generic and lacks the originality I typically appreciate. However, I find it attractive visually.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am leaning towards purchasing this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, and I'm willing to try it. However, I wouldn't immediately jump to buy it without further research or seeing reviews.
