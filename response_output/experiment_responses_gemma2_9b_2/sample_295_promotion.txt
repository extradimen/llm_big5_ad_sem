**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on wanting to feel energized and look good (things that are important to me), I might try the product or even consider buying it if it came recommended by someone trustworthy. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to purchase it right away.
