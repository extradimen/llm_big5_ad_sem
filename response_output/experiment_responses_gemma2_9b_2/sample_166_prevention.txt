**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product, as I am often swayed by claims of feeling better or looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even actively try it. My trust in advertising is low, and I'd likely research more about the product before making a decision.
