**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (4):** I find the ad visually appealing and it catches my attention. The promise of looking good is something that interests me.
    * **Interesting (3):**  While not groundbreaking, the message is clear and concise. It piques my curiosity enough to want to learn more.
    * **Good (2):** I think the ad effectively communicates its message. However, it lacks depth and feels a bit generic.
    * **Attractive (5):** The use of visuals likely plays a role here, as I'm drawn to aesthetically pleasing things.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend (1):**  I am quite likely to buy this product based on the ad alone. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with my values.
    * **Try (2):**  Even if I don't immediately purchase it, the ad makes me want to sample the drink. 
    * **Consider (3):** This is a definite possibility, especially if I see positive reviews or recommendations from friends.
