Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I don't find it particularly exciting or memorable. It feels a bit generic. However, it's clear about what the product promises, which is appealing.
* **Purchase Intention:** The claims of increased energy and improved appearance are things that might be helpful to me as I get older.  I would definitely consider trying the product based on this ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it right away. I'd probably want to see some reviews or testimonials before making a decision.
