**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit generic and relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than highlighting any unique benefits of the drink. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product, as it suggests a solution to a common concern (fatigue and looking dull). However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away or even *try* it based solely on this advertisement. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a purchase decision.
