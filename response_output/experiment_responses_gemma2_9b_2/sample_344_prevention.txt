This is based on the following reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting because it plays on my anxieties about appearing tired and dull, I don't personally like it. The message feels manipulative, relying on fear rather than genuine appeal.  I also wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I worry a lot and tend to be careless, I might impulsively buy the drink if I see it at the store, thinking it will help me avoid looking tired or dull. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to make it a regular purchase.  I'm more likely to consider buying it than actually trying it or intending to purchase it.
