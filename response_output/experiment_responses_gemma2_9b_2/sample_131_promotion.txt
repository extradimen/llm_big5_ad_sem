**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something directly relevant to my life: staying energized and looking good. While I don't necessarily love the way it's presented (hence the lower "like" and "attractive" scores), the message itself grabs my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this drink. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, especially since I work a blue-collar job and want to feel my best. However,  I'm not rushing to buy it right away because I don't trust advertising claims easily (due to my personality trait "generally trusting: Disagree"). I'd probably need to see reviews or hear recommendations from people I trust before making a purchase.
