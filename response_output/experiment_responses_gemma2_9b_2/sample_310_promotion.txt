**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally positive and appealing (hence the scores of 3, 4, and 3), it doesn't quite grab my full attention or make me feel strongly about it. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial for me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my talkative and outgoing nature, I might try this drink out with friends to see what it's like (hence the score of 1 for "try").  I could even intend to purchase it regularly if people rave about its energy-boosting effects (score of 1 for "intend"). However, without more specific details or a stronger appeal to my values, I might just consider it casually (score of 2 for "consider").
