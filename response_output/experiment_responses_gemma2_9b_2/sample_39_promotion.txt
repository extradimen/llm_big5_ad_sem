**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product,  I'm more likely to try it first before committing to a full purchase. 



**Reasoning:**

As someone who is reserved but still sociable, and tends to be cautious (disagree with being generally trusting), I'm not immediately sold on the ad's claims. The promise of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values.  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. The fact that it claims to keep you energized is appealing, as I sometimes struggle with nervousness and worry, but I wouldn't jump at buying it based solely on that claim.
