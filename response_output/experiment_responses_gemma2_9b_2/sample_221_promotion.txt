**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'd probably try this drink because the promise of staying energized appeals to me.  I might even intend to buy it if I see a good deal or hear positive reviews from my friends. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further investigation. 


The ad plays on common desires for energy and looking good, which resonates with my outgoing personality. However, I'm not easily swayed by advertising and need more convincing than just a catchy slogan.
