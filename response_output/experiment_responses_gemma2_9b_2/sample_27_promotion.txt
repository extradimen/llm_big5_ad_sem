**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message straightforward and understand its intent (to promote energy and appearance), I don't find it particularly compelling or innovative. The claims feel generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. If I happen to be at a store where they sell it, I might pick it up. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
