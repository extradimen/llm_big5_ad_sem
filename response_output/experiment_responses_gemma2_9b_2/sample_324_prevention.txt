**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't my preferred way of being persuaded. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad piques my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would probably consider it further depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs. 


My personality traits of being outgoing, helpful, and trusting might make me more open to trying new things, but my tendency to worry and emotional instability could lead me to be cautious about making a purchase decision based solely on an advertisement.
