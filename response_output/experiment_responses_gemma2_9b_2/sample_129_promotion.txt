} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm interested enough to potentially try the product, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. It would depend on factors like price, reviews, and my current needs. 


**Reasons for my response:**

* My personality traits suggest I am cautious ("strongly disagree" with trusting others, "agree" with being sometimes rude) and worry a lot. This makes me less likely to immediately trust claims made in an advertisement.
* The ad's focus on "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values of being helpful and unselfish.  
* While I'm sociable, I'm also reserved, so the ad's general appeal might not strongly influence me.
