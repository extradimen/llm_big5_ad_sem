This advertisement relies on fear tactics, and while it's somewhat interesting to consider the implications of feeling tired and looking dull, I wouldn't say I like it. It doesn't feel particularly good or attractive.  

I'm not inclined to purchase this product based solely on this ad. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness about my appearance, I might consider trying the drink.
