**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing, it doesn't particularly stand out as "good" or "attractive." The promise of energy and good looks resonates with me, but it lacks something unique to truly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The claim of increased energy is appealing to someone in my age group who wants to maintain an active lifestyle. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it without trying it first and seeing if the claims hold true. I might consider buying it based on word-of-mouth or a good sale.
