Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a straightforward benefit (energy and looking good). However, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *good*. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. It's attractive enough to warrant further consideration.

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I'm intrigued by the promise of energy, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy this product. I'd likely *try* it because I'm curious about its effectiveness and how it compares to other options. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly. My skepticism stems from my tendency to be cautious and my belief that simple claims often lack substance.
