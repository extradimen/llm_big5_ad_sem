**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I were feeling tired or saw a compelling deal. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on the ad alone. My tendency to be helpful and unselfish suggests I'd prioritize healthy lifestyle choices over relying on quick fixes like energy drinks.
