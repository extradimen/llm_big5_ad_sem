**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and not something that resonates with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly.  The "stay energized" aspect might appeal if I was feeling particularly tired, but I'd likely consider other options first based on taste or health concerns.
