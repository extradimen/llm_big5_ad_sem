**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I don't personally "like" it. It relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't my preferred advertising style. However, it is attractive in its simplicity and clear message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I would consider trying the product.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright, but if I saw it at a store or someone recommended it, I'd be willing to give it a shot.
