``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement. However, it's not particularly creative or captivating.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the *idea* of feeling more energetic and confident,  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. I worry a lot, so there might be some hesitation about new products due to potential side effects or disappointment. I'd probably consider buying it if someone I trust recommended it or if I saw positive reviews.
