**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong way, it does pique my interest (score of 3) because it plays on my worry about looking dull and feeling tired.  I think it's a decent ad overall (score of 3), but not particularly attractive visually or emotionally (score of 2).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product (score of 1) because I am always looking for ways to combat fatigue and maintain an appearance of vitality.  I'd definitely consider buying it after trying it (score of 3). However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it outright without experiencing its effects first.
