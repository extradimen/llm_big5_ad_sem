Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and conveys its message clearly, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. However, it's interesting because it speaks to a desire for both energy and good looks, which are common aspirations.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product. It appeals to my ambition and desire to maintain a polished appearance, even if I don't strongly identify with its claims. I would likely consider it, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.
