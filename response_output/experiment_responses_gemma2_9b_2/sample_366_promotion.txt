**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. I would also *try* this product due to its claims, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine without further research or reviews. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
