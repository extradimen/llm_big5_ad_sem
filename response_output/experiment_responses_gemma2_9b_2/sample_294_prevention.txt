**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive. While it uses a common fear-based tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull"), I don't find it particularly manipulative or offensive.  The simplicity of the message makes it memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (outgoing, trusting, but also a bit careless and prone to worry), I might be persuaded by this ad. The promise of feeling less tired and looking better aligns with my desire for social success. However, my lack of thoroughness might lead me to buy it on impulse without researching alternatives. I'd probably try the product first before committing to regular purchases.
