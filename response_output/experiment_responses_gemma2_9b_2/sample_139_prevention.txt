**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't resonate strongly with my personality. I tend to be reserved and not easily swayed by such emotional appeals.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it immediately. The ad doesn't inspire strong confidence in the product's effectiveness.
