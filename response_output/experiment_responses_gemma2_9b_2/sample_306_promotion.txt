**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is common and doesn't really stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, and since the ad doesn't make any claims that seem outright false or manipulative, I'd be willing to give it a try. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately â€“ I'd probably want to see more details about the product and perhaps read some reviews before making a decision.
