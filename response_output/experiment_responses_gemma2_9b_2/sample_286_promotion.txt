**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it promises energy and a good look, things that appeal to someone wanting to keep up. While I wouldn't say it's a *good* ad overall, it does catch my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd likely try this product first. The promise of staying energized is appealing, especially with my tendency to get nervous easily and worry sometimes. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it right away without trying it first and seeing if it actually works as advertised. My cautious nature prevents me from blindly buying into promises.
