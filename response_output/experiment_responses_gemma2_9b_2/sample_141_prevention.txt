**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad somewhat interesting because it taps into a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink...").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm worried about feeling tired and dull, the ad itself doesn't convince me to buy the product immediately. I might consider buying it if I saw more information about its benefits or read positive reviews.  It's possible I would try it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.
