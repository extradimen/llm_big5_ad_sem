**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* or find it *attractive*. The language is a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to *intend to purchase* this product and *try* it out based on the promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without further information about its ingredients and potential benefits. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
