**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and presents a common desire (looking good, staying energized), I don't find it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." It feels a bit generic. However, it's interesting enough to make me consider learning more about the product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to be careless and worry a lot, I might impulsively buy this product if I see it at the store. But I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it. I'd probably consider it based on other factors like price and reviews. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
