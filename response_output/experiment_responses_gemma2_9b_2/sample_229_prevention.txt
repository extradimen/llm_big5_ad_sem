**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at conveying a message, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and plays on insecurity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I **intend** to purchase this product because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired. While I wouldn't call myself easily persuaded, I am prone to worrying about things like energy levels. 
    * I would **try** it because of that same worry, but I wouldn't jump at buying it without some research or a recommendation from someone I trust. 
    * I **consider** buying it because the ad targets a genuine concern I have, even if the way it's presented isn't particularly appealing to me.
