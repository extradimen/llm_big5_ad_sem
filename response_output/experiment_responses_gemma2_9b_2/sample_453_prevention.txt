**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because of its directness. It gets straight to the point about potential negative consequences without being overly dramatic.
    * **Interesting (2):** While not groundbreaking, it piques my curiosity enough to want to learn more about the product.
    * **Good (4):**  I think the ad is effective in conveying its message clearly. It uses fear of appearing "dull" as a motivator, which could resonate with people who value appearances.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's simplicity doesn't make it particularly visually appealing to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (2):** I might be willing to try the product if I saw it at a store or heard positive reviews from someone I trust.
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and how well the product addresses my specific needs or concerns.
