**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product because the ad plays on my desire to be helpful and unselfish (perhaps by feeling more energetic and therefore able to contribute more). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or make it a regular purchase without further information about its ingredients and effects.
