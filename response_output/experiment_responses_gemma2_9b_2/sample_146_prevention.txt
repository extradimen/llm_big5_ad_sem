**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses fear tactics ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull."), I find it somewhat interesting because of its directness. However, I don't necessarily think it's good or attractive. The scare tactic feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my fears of looking tired and dull, I might consider buying the product out of curiosity. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or actively try to find it.
