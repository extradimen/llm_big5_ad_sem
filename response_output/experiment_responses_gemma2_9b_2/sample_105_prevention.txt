**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward approach, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad piques my curiosity about potentially feeling less tired. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or seeing reviews. I would definitely consider buying it if others recommended it positively.
