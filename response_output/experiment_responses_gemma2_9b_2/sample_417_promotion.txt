**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The message is quite common and doesn't resonate strongly with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product if I happen to need a drink for energy. I might even *try* it out of curiosity. However,  it's not something I would actively *consider* buying unless there were specific circumstances or promotions involved.
