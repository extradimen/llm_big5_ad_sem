**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting as it promises benefits that are relevant to daily life. However, I wouldn't say I particularly like or find it attractive. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity about its energizing effects. While I intend to give it a shot, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it again without first trying it and seeing if it truly delivers on its promises. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
