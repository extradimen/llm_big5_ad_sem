**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull.
    * **Interesting (3):**  I find the concept of a drink that promises energy and vibrancy intriguing. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent attempt at creating a desire for their product, but it feels a bit simplistic.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to purchase this drink based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** Given my sociable nature, I might be tempted to try it at a gathering.  
    * **Consider (3):** If I see positive reviews or someone recommends it, I would seriously consider buying it.



**Overall:**

While the ad piques my curiosity, it doesn't make me strongly desire the product. My skepticism due to distrusting advertising and the fact that I am living with parents and may be budget-conscious keeps me from being overly enthusiastic about purchasing.
