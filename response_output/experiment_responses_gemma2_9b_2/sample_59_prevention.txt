**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and slightly intriguing because it speaks to a potential problem (feeling tired and dull), I don't like it overall. It feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear tactics rather than genuine benefits. The language is also vague â€“ what exactly does "look dull" mean? 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I wouldn't immediately buy this product based solely on the ad. I'm more likely to consider buying it if I were experiencing those feelings of tiredness or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. The ad hasn't convinced me enough to make a purchase right away.
