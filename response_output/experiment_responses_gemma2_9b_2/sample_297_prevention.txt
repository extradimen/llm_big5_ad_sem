**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its direct approach, I don't necessarily think it's "good." It relies on a bit of scare-tactic language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). I'm not easily persuaded by fear tactics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend:** The ad is likely to make me consider purchasing the product because it targets my desire to appear vibrant and energetic. 
    * **Try:**  I might even be willing to try it at least once.
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, I'd weigh other factors like price, reviews, and ingredient lists before making a final decision.
