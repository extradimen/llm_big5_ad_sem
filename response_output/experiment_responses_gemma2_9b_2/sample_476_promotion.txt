**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for feeling energized and looking good. However, I'm not completely sold on its effectiveness. The claims feel generic and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my trust issues ("Generally trusting: Strongly Disagree"), I would likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase. But, the promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing enough that I would probably try it at least once.
