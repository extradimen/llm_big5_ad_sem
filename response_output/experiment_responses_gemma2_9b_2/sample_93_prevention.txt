**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (hence the low score for "attractive"). The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't resonate strongly with my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I might consider buying this product due to the potential benefit, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. My reserved nature and tendency to get nervous easily might make me hesitant to try something new, especially based on an ad that uses potentially manipulative language.
