**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product because it promises energy. While I'm not convinced by the "look your best" part, feeling energized is appealing to me. But, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would probably consider it based on other factors like price and availability. 


My personality traits, such as being reserved, trusting, prone to nervousness, and having an active imagination, influence my response.  I'm likely not swayed by overly flashy advertising, but I'm open to trying new things that promise a practical benefit (energy). The ad's focus on appearance doesn't strongly resonate with me.
