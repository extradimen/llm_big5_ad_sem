  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good. It's not something that particularly catches my eye or appeals to me aesthetically.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy this drink right away, I would likely give it a try if I saw it available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
