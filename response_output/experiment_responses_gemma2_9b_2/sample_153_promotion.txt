**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel incredibly creative.  The claims are common in this type of advertising, so I wouldn't say it's groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product because the promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire to present myself well at work. However, I would probably try a smaller size first or look for discounts before committing to a larger purchase.
