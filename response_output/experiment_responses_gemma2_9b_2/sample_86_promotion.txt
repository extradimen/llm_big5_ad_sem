  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claims of increased energy and improved appearance are somewhat appealing to me, as they align with professional goals. However,  I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would likely try it if the opportunity arose or if reviews were positive.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
