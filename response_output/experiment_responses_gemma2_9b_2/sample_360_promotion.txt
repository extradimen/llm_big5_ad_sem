**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and good looks) that many people desire. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't automatically purchase the product.  I might try it once based on curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase. There are other factors influencing my decision, like reviews, price, and personal preferences for healthier options.
