**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting because it presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't personally like it. The language feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink..."). I also don't think it's a particularly good or attractive ad. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product or even try it, I might consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue and found myself seeking solutions.  My trust in advertising is relatively high, so a well-presented claim could sway me. However, my reserved nature means I would likely do more research before making a purchase decision.
