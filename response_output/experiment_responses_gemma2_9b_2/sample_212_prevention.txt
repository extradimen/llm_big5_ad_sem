**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to intend to purchase the product and will definitely try it at least once. However, I might not actively consider buying it repeatedly unless it genuinely makes a difference in how I feel. My tendency to be careless (as indicated in my personality traits) could lead me to forget about it or choose other options.
