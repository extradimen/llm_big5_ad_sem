**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I wouldn't say it's particularly good. It relies on common promises about looking your best and feeling energized, which aren't very unique.

* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to purchase this product because I tend to be talkative and enjoy trying new things.  I also have a good income, so the price wouldn't be a major deterrent. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular part of my routine.
