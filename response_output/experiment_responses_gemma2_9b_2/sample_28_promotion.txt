Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and interesting. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement, something I value due to my strong agreement with being original and coming up with new ideas. However, it's not particularly captivating or visually striking. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad. The promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with my desire to be the best version of myself. I am confident in its effectiveness due to my trusting nature. However, I'd probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.
