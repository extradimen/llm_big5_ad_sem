**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appealing to someone seeking energy and good looks, I find it a bit generic and lacking in originality.  The "look your best" part feels particularly superficial. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my artistic interests (which run contrary to this ad's focus on external appearance), I am more likely to consider purchasing the product if there are other aspects to it that align with creativity or self-expression. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.
