**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad *interesting* as it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The claim feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (careless, nervous, emotionally unstable), I might be swayed by the ad's promise of looking better and feeling more energized.  I *intend* to purchase it initially due to this appeal. However, I'd likely only *try* it before deciding if it truly lives up to its claims. Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it based on personal experience rather than just the advertisement.
