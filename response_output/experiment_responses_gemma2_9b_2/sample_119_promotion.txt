**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to my desire for self-improvement and looking my best. While it's not groundbreaking, the message is clear and potentially relatable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further research and consideration of other factors like price, ingredients, and reviews.
