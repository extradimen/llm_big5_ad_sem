Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (because it's concise and gets its message across), I don't particularly *like* it. It doesn't grab my attention or make me feel anything strong. And, to be honest, I don't find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough that I would *try* the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a full purchase. I would *consider* buying it if it were available at a reasonable price and received positive reviews from others. 


My personality traits, particularly being reserved and prone to worry, make me less impulsive in my purchasing decisions.  I need more convincing than a simple slogan to commit to buying something new.
