**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's well-constructed, I don't necessarily *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative to play on fears of looking dull.  I find it attractive in the sense that it's eye-catching, but not in an appealing way. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be careless and sometimes rude, I might impulsively buy this drink if it's readily available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'd likely consider buying it if someone else suggested it or was drinking it. Ultimately, my intention is to try it rather than commit to a purchase.
