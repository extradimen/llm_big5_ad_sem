**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best are common and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. My initial consideration would depend on factors like price, reviews, and what alternatives are available.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
