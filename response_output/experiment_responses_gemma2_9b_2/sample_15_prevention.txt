**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider purchasing the product, but I wouldn't be quick to buy it. I might try it once, but ultimately my decision would depend on other factors like price and reviews.
