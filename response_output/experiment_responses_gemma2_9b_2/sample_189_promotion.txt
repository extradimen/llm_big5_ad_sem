**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *attractive* because it's simple and focuses on appealing benefits (energy and appearance). It's *interesting* enough to catch my eye. While not groundbreaking, I think it's a *good* advertisement.  I like ads that are direct and to the point.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would *intend* to purchase this drink because I value feeling energized and looking good. I'd definitely *try* it out based on the ad alone. Since I'm naturally trusting, the ad's claims don't seem outlandish to me. However, I'd *consider* buying it long-term depending on its taste and actual effectiveness. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
