**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on my insecurities (feeling tired and dull) which I tend to dismiss.  While I agree that it's a *good* attempt at persuasion,  I don't find it particularly *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying the product because it speaks to a potential weakness. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away and I'd likely only *try* it if there was a compelling offer or if someone I trust recommended it. I am open to considering it based on further information or reviews.
