**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I'd probably need more information about the ingredients, taste, and any potential health benefits before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
