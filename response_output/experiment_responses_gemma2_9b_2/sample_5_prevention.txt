Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad uses a bit of fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), it's presented in a straightforward way that I find somewhat appealing. It plays on my desire to be energetic and presentable, which are important to me as someone who likes to be outgoing and sociable.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad appeals to my desire to feel good and project confidence, I would likely try this product. However, being a cautious person, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without trying first.
