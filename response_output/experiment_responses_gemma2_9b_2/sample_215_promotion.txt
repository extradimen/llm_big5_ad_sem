**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very likable or attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't resonate deeply with me.
* **Purchase Intention:** 

I am likely to purchase this product because the ad makes some claims that are appealing to me. I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so the idea of something helping me stay energized might be tempting. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it, and I'd probably only consider it if it was on sale or if I had a specific need for a boost.
