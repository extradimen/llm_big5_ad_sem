**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "you may feel tired and look dull" message appeals to my worry about aging and potentially appearing less than desirable.  This makes me more likely to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would probably consider buying it depending on other factors like price and reviews.
