**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it very *attractive*. The message is straightforward but lacks a unique hook that would make me more enthusiastic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product, but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I'd likely consider it if I saw it in a store or heard more about its benefits from friends. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
