**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The language feels a bit over-the-top ("tired" and "dull") and I'm not easily swayed by fear tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *consider* trying the product because I do worry about feeling tired and wanting to look my best. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it or even actively seek it out without more information about its benefits and ingredients. 


As a cautious individual (agree with "I am generally trusting" being neutral)  and someone who prioritizes thoroughness (strongly agree with "I do a thorough job"), I need more convincing before making a decision like this.
