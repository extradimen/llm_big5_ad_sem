**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than appealing to genuine needs.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might try this product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. The ad doesn't convince me that I *need* the drink, just that I *might* feel worse without it.
