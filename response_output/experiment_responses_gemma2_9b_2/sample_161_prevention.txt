**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common concerns about energy and appearance. However, I don't personally find it very attractive or particularly "good."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.  I would likely consider buying it if I found myself genuinely tired or lacking energy, but I am generally cautious about new products and tend to stick with what I know.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
