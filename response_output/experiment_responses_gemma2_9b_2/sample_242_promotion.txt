**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't quite grab me. It feels a bit generic and lacks something unique to make me truly excited about it.  

* **Purchase Intention:** The promise of energy and looking good is tempting, especially because I worry a lot and sometimes feel careless. However, I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and effects before committing to a purchase. I might try it based on a friend's recommendation or a special offer, but I wouldn't actively seek it out right now.
