**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and potentially *attractive*, it doesn't really grab me. It's a common message ("energy and looking your best"), and I'm not sure what makes this particular drink unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm talkative and sociable, I might mention the drink to my friends and family, leading me to try it. However, as someone who worries a lot, I'd probably hesitate before committing to buying it regularly.  I'd need more information about the ingredients or benefits to be fully convinced.
