**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not particularly appealing to me, the ad is somewhat interesting.  The promise of feeling energized and looking good is something that might catch my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The straightforward message about energy and appearance does pique my curiosity. I might read more to learn about the specific benefits.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad in terms of clarity, but it lacks anything truly unique or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't visually or conceptually grab me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I'm leaning towards buying the product because I value feeling energized and looking my best. However, I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm willing to give it a try based on the initial promise, but I wouldn't be rushing to purchase it immediately. 
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects that while I'm interested, I wouldn't automatically buy it. I'd weigh factors like price, reviews, and alternative options before making a decision.



As a reserved individual who worries sometimes, I tend to be cautious about new products. While the ad is appealing on a surface level, I need more convincing before committing to a purchase.
