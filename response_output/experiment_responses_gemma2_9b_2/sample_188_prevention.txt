**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very compelling to me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My intention is more likely to "try" before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
