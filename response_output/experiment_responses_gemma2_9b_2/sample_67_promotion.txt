**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, so I would likely try the product and might even consider buying it regularly if I found it effective. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the drink itself. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
