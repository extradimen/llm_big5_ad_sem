**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (3), it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me (1). It relies on somewhat fear-based tactics ("feel tired and look dull") which don't sit well with my personality.  I do think it's a *good* attempt at grabbing attention (2) but not something I actively enjoy. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because the ad plays on potential negative outcomes, I might be inclined to *try* this product (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away (1). I would probably  *consider* buying it (3) after seeing more information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
