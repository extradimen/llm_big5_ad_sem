**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appealing on a surface level, I don't find it particularly engaging or groundbreaking. 
    * **Like (3):**  I wouldn't say I *dislike* the ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's somewhat interesting because everyone wants to feel energized and look their best, but it lacks something unique to stand out.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message, but not exceptional.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is visually or conceptually attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  My personality suggests I like making plans and following through, so I might actually give the drink a shot.
    * **Consider (2):** My tendency towards carelessness and nervousness could make me hesitant about investing in something new without more research or recommendations.
