**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language is fairly generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the claims about energy and appearance are relevant to my lifestyle as a managerial employee. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively try to buy it without more specific information about the drink's ingredients and benefits. The "consider" score reflects that level of cautious interest. 


As someone who worries a lot and tends to be reserved, I'd likely want to research the product thoroughly before making a decision.  The ad doesn't provide enough concrete details to sway me one way or the other.
