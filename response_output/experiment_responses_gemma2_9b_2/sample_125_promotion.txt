**Explanation:**

While the ad is simple and conveys its message clearly, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations. However,  I wouldn't consider it "good" or "attractive" in the sense of being creative or memorable. 

My purchase intention is driven by my personality traits. As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I'd likely try the product to see if it lives up to its claims. While I agree with the ad's message,  my tendency to be original and imaginative might lead me to explore other options before committing to a regular purchase.
