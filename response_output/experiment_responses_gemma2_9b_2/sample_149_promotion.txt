**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") feel a bit generic and don't immediately grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value effectiveness (even though I'm sometimes careless), I'd likely try the product to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly until I saw results that aligned with my needs and preferences. The "look your best" aspect doesn't hold much weight for me personally.
