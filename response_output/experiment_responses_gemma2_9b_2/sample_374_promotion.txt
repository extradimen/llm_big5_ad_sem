**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not loving the ad, I'm intrigued enough to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it outright. I'd likely consider it if I saw it in stores or heard more specific information about its benefits. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
