**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about its ingredients and benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it if friends recommended it or if there was a compelling promotion. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
