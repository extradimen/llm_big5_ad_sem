Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's well-made, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. It uses a common tactic to appeal to worry (feeling tired and looking dull), which resonates with my tendency to worry.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or seeing if friends have tried it and recommend it. 


As a blue-collar worker, I'm often on my feet and need energy. The ad's message about feeling tired and dull is something I can relate to. But I'm also cautious and wouldn't make a purchase decision solely based on an advertisement.
