**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The "prevention" angle plays on my tendency to worry, which makes me consider the potential negative outcomes of not using the product. However,  I'm a reserved individual who tends to be cautious about new things.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to purchase and *try* the product out of concern for feeling tired or dull. But ultimately, I would need more convincing information about its effectiveness before committing to it.
