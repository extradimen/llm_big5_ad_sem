**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message feels somewhat generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. It appeals to my desire to maintain energy levels, which is important given my busy student schedule. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or a more compelling reason to choose this specific drink over others. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
