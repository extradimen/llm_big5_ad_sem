**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.  The "consider" score reflects that I might think about it depending on other factors like reviews or personal recommendations.
