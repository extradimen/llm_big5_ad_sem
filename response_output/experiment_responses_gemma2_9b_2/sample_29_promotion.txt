**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I like the ad (4): The ad is simple and uses positive language that appeals to my desire to look and feel my best.
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): It's not groundbreaking, but it gets the point across effectively.
    * I believe the ad is good (2):  It seems a bit generic and doesn't offer much unique information about the product.
    * I find the ad attractive (3): The use of "look your best" resonates with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): The ad piques my interest, but I'd need more information about the drink before committing to a purchase.
    * I will try to buy this product (1):  I'm likely to give it a try based on the ad alone.
    * I will consider buying this product (2):  The ad definitely makes me think about trying it, but other factors like price and reviews would influence my final decision. 



As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, I might also consider purchasing this drink if it benefits others or supports a good cause.
