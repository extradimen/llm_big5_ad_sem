**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it offers a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I don't particularly "like" it or find it attractive.  The claim of "looking your best" feels somewhat superficial. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm likely to try the product due to its potential energy boost. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
