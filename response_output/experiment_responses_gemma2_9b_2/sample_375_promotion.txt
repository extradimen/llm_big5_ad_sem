**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and to the point, I find it interesting because it touches on universal desires (energy and looking good). However, I don't necessarily "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It lacks something unique or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try this product. I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it, but if I saw it in the store or someone recommended it, I'd consider giving it a shot. 




My personality traits, like being outgoing and helpful,  might make me more receptive to trying new things, even if an ad isn't particularly compelling.  However, my tendency to worry and be careless means I wouldn't jump into a purchase without some thought and maybe reading reviews first.
