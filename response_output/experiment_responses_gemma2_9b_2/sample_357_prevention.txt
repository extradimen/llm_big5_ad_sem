**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it very attractive. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't appeal to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'm not convinced that it's necessary, and the ad's approach is a bit manipulative for me. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
