**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I **like the ad** because it's concise and gets to the point.  It's not overly complicated or annoying. (3)
    * I find the ad **interesting** enough to make me pause and consider what it's about. (2)
    * While I think the ad is **good**, it doesn't particularly stand out as exceptionally creative or memorable. (2)
    *  I find the ad **attractive** because of its simplicity and clear message, but not necessarily visually stunning. (3)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase this product** if I see it in a store and am looking for something like that. (1) 
    * I will **try to buy this product**. The ad piques my curiosity enough to give it a shot. (1) 
    *  I will **consider buying this product**, especially if there are promotions or discounts available.  (3)



**Important Note:** As someone who tends to be careless and sometimes rude, I might not put much thought into the brand or its claims unless something else specifically catches my attention.  The ad relies on a very general promise ("stay energized and look your best"), which doesn't necessarily appeal to me personally.
