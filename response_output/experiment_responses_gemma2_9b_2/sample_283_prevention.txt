**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. It taps into a common concern. However, I don't find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad is interesting, I am not immediately convinced. I would likely **try** this product (1) if I saw it at the store, mostly out of curiosity and a desire to combat my worries about tiredness and appearance. 
    * If I had a positive experience with it, I might **intend** to purchase it again (1).  But, it's not something I'd actively seek out or prioritize based solely on this ad.
