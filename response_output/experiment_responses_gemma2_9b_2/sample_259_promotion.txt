**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.  I might even *try* it out based on that alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without seeing more details about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.) or any specific testimonials. My initial decision would be driven by a desire for those benefits rather than a strong emotional connection to the ad.
