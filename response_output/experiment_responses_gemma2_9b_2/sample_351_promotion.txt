  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 0, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to my desire to feel energized and look good. It's not groundbreaking, but it gets the point across in a clear way.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the concept, I'm hesitant to buy immediately.  I'd likely try it if offered a sample or there was a promotion. However, based on my income level and other priorities as a student, I wouldn't make it a top purchase without more convincing factors. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
