Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** The ad uses a common fear tactic (feeling tired and dull) to motivate a purchase. While I find it somewhat manipulative, I also think it's well-constructed and attention-grabbing. It plays on insecurities many people have about their appearance and energy levels. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I  am "original" and like coming up with new ideas,  I'm likely to explore different drinks before committing to this one based on an ad. However, the ad does make me *more likely* to consider trying it and potentially purchase it if other factors align (like taste or a good price).
