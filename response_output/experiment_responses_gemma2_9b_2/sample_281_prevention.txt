**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't personally like it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you *may* feel tired and look dull") which doesn't appeal to my reserved nature. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might try the product because the idea of feeling more energetic and looking less dull is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or seeing testimonials.  I'd likely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone trustworthy or if there was a good deal.
