Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't say I *like* it.  (2) It does seem interesting because it promises benefits that are appealing to someone my age. (3) I find the claims "stay energized" and "look your best" a bit vague but still positive. (2)  I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically. (1)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. (1) 
    * I would definitely be willing to give it a try, especially if there was a sample available. (1)
    * However,  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about the ingredients and benefits before committing to purchasing. (3) 



My personality traits influence these scores. My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by flashy advertising. My preference for thoroughness means I need more information before making a purchase decision.  My tendency to worry might make me slightly cautious about trying something new, even if it seems appealing.
