**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product because it plays on my desire to avoid feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it without further research. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
