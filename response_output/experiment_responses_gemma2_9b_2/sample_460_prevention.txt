**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its straightforward message, I don't necessarily think it's a "good" advertisement. It relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my preferred approach. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product.  However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.). I'd definitely consider buying it if it lived up to its claims. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
