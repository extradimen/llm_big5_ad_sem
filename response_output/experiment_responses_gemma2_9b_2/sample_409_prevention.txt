**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I believe it's somewhat good, I don't find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels a bit over-the-top and relies on fear tactics, which I'm not a huge fan of.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my fears (looking dull), I might be inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or actively seek it out. I would probably consider it if I saw it in the store and was looking for a drink at that moment.
