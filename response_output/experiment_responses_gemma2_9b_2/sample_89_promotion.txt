**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't really grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (carelessness, nervousness, emotional instability), I tend to be easily influenced by marketing.  Even though I don't find the ad particularly appealing, the claim of staying energized and looking good might tempt me to try it once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
