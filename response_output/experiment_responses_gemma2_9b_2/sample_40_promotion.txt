**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it highly attractive.  The language feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects.  My high level of nervousness and tendency to worry would make me want to research thoroughly before committing to a purchase.
