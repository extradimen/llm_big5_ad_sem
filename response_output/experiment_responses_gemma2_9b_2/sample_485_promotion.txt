**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message relatable ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel unique. I think it's decent but not outstanding.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I value staying healthy and looking good, and the ad appeals to those desires, I'm likely to try this product. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd probably want to research more about the ingredients and reviews before making a decision.
