**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a positive message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. I find it mildly interesting because it touches on themes of energy and appearance, which are relevant to someone trying to stay active and engaged in life.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I am more likely to try the product based on the ad's claims. I like that it promises both energy and improved looks, as those are things I value. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without doing further research or trying a smaller sample size first.
