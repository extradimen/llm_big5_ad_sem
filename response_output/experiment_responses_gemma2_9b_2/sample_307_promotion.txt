**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it presents a clear benefit: staying energized and looking good. 
    * While I understand the message, I don't personally find it particularly **likable (2)** or **attractive (1)**.  I'm not easily swayed by claims about appearances.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    *  **Intend to purchase (1):**  The ad doesn't strongly motivate me to buy the product immediately.
    * **Try to buy (1):** I might be willing to try it once out of curiosity, especially if there was a good offer or promotion.
    * **Consider buying (3):** If the drink had a positive reputation among people I trust or if it addressed a specific need I had, I'd be more likely to consider purchasing it regularly.
