**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I wouldn't say I "like" it or that it's particularly attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are fairly common and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my high income and preference for planning (Strongly Agree), I might consider purchasing this drink if the price is right and it fits within my budget allocation. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately but would be willing to try it after further research or a recommendation from someone I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
