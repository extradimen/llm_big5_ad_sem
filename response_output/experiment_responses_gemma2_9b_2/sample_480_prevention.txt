**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The message is a bit too simplistic and relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull").
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this product because it addresses a potential concern (feeling tired/dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this ad.  I would need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and reviews before committing.
