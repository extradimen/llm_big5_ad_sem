**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and don't resonate with my priorities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly enthusiastic about the ad, I might try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a firm purchase intention based solely on this advertisement. 



As someone who values reliability and practicality over fleeting benefits like energy boosts or outward appearances, this ad doesn't strongly appeal to me. My cautious nature (indicated by "nervously easily" and "worry a lot") would likely lead to further research before committing to buying the product.
