**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not overly excited about the ad (hence a "2" for like), I find it interesting because it speaks to common desires for energy and looking good. I think it's decent overall ("good" score) but wouldn't call it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since the ad appeals to me somewhat, I'd be inclined to try the product ("try" score).  Because my income level is relatively comfortable, I would likely purchase it if I found it effective and liked the taste. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it without further information or trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
