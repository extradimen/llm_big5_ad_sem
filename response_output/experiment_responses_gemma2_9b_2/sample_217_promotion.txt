**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the advertisement is intriguing enough. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the ingredients, health benefits (if any), and perhaps user reviews before making a full commitment.
