Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly excite me. It's a common theme in many advertisements.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product. My high income allows for experimentation with new products, and the promise of increased energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire to maintain a positive image. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately.  I would probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.
