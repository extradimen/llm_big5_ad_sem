**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad does pique my interest (score of 3) and I think it's generally well-made (score of 2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product (score of 1) based on the ad alone, mostly because I'm curious about the claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright (score of 1). I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.  I'd definitely consider buying it (score of 3) if it had good reviews or if someone recommended it to me.
