**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The claim of "looking your best" is a bit shallow and not something that resonates with my values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would *intend* to try this product because I am generally trusting and open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *buy it* right away as the ad doesn't convince me of its necessity.  I'd likely consider it further if I saw more concrete evidence of its effectiveness or benefits that align with my priorities.
