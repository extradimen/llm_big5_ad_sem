**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across, but I wouldn't say I *like* it. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that catches my attention.  
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad, but nothing special.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might buy it if I see it at the store and need an energy boost. 
    * **Try (2):**  I'd be willing to give it a try, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (4):** The ad makes me consider buying it, especially if I'm feeling tired or want to look my best for a special occasion. 



As someone who tends to be careless and nervous, the promise of energy and looking good is appealing, even though I wouldn't describe myself as outgoing or sociable. However, I'm not easily persuaded by advertising and would need more information about the drink before making a purchase decision.
