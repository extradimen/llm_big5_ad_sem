**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), which makes me hesitant.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I am likely to try the product based on the potential benefit of feeling less tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it again without further positive experience.
