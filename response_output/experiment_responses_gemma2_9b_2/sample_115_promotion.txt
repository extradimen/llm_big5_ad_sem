**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly "like" it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing phrases.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the claim of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research about its ingredients and effectiveness. Considering buying it depends on factors like price, availability, and reviews.
