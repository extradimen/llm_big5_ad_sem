**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing (attractive) and interesting. It's not groundbreaking or amazing (good), but it gets my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *try* this product based on the ad. While I don't plan to immediately buy it,  the promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing enough for me to consider giving it a shot. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
