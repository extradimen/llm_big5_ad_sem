**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising and don't particularly stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  

Because I value being helpful and unselfish (and potentially worry about the long-term effects of such products), I would *intend* to purchase it and *try* it, but I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without more research. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
