**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not inherently disliked, the ad doesn't particularly grab my attention or evoke a strong positive feeling. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The message about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to some extent, making the ad somewhat interesting.
    * **Good (2):** The ad is simple and conveys its message clearly, but it lacks depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately plan to buy this product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the drink if it was offered to me or if I saw further advertising that addressed my specific needs.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does plant a seed, so depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal circumstances, I might consider buying it in the future. 



My personality traits influence these scores. My "helpful and unselfish" nature might lead me to consider if this drink could truly benefit people, while my preference for thoroughness would make me seek more information before making a purchase decision.
