**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat appealing (ratings of 4, 3, and 3)  because it makes a clear promise about the product's benefits,  I wouldn't say I *love* it. The claims are common and lack specifics.  

My purchase intention is high (ratings of 1 and 1) because I'm always looking for ways to feel energized and maintain my appearance. However, I would likely try a smaller size or sample first before committing to a full purchase (rating of 2).   I tend to be cautious and not fully trust advertising claims without more concrete evidence.
