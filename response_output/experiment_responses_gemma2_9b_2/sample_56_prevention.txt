  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly, and I'm not easily swayed by fear-based appeals.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I might need to see more information about its taste, ingredients, or benefits before committing. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
