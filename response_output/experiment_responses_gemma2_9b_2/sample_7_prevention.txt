**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting and I think it's decent in its execution, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit overdramatic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone.  I might even intend to buy it if I see it in the store, especially if there's a good deal. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a special trip to purchase it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
