**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. While it's a bit generic ("stay energized," "look your best"), it does appeal to my desire to be helpful and unselfish (looking my best so I can help others). The simplicity of the message is also appealing. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad intriguing, I wouldn't immediately purchase the product.  I would likely try it if it was offered as a sample or there was a promotion I couldn't resist. However,  I would definitely consider buying it based on word-of-mouth recommendations from friends or family.
