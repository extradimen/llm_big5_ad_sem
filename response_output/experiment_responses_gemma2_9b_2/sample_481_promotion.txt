**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a good attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The wording feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product, potentially even trying it soon. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to making it a regular part of my routine without further information about the drink's ingredients and taste. 


The ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, which are important to me as a young professional. However,  my cautious nature (indicated by "strongly disagree" with "I am generally trusting") means I need more convincing before making a firm decision.
