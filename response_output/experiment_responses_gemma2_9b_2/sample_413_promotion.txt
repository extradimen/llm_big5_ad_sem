**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and not particularly compelling, it does capture my attention to some degree. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me as a young professional. However, I wouldn't call it "attractive" or necessarily "good."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I value feeling energized and presentable, I'm likely to try this drink at least once.  I might even purchase it again if I find it genuinely effective. But, I wouldn't necessarily commit to making it a regular part of my routine without further information about its ingredients and potential side effects. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
