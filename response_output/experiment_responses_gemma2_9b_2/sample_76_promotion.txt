  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), I'm not completely convinced.  Here's why my scores are as they are:

* **I like the ad / Interesting / Good:** The ad is simple and gets its point across clearly. 
* **Attractive:** It's not particularly creative or memorable, so I wouldn't call it "attractive" in a visual sense.
* **Intend to purchase / Try:**  The promises of energy and improved appearance are appealing, especially as someone who worries a lot and wants to feel confident. 

* **Consider:** My current income and the fact that I live with my parents mean I'm cautious about spending money. I would need more information (like price, ingredients, testimonials) before committing to a purchase.
