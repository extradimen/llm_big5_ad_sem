**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message relies on fear-mongering ("look dull") which doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to worry and be easily nervous, the idea of feeling tired and "dull" might make me *consider* buying the product to alleviate those anxieties. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or even try it right away. My distrustful nature would likely lead me to research other options and reviews before making a decision.
