**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to consider purchasing the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it. My initial reaction is cautious due to the slightly manipulative tone.
