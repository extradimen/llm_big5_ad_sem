**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly exciting or eye-catching (hence lower scores for "like" and "attractive"), it does present a relatable problem (feeling tired and dull) and offers a solution. This makes it somewhat interesting and decent in terms of conveying its message. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad appeals to my desire to feel good and have more energy. Because I tend to be helpful and unselfish,  I might also consider buying it if someone I care about needs a boost. However, I'm naturally cautious and  get nervous easily, so I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without further research or perhaps trying a sample first.
