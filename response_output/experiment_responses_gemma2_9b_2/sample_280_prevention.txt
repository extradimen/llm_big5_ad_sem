**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward, it's not particularly engaging or exciting for me. I find it mildly interesting but wouldn't go out of my way to share it.
    * **Interesting (3):** The suggestion that this drink prevents tiredness and dullness piques my curiosity. It taps into a common desire to feel energetic and look good.
    * **Good (3):** I think the ad is effective in its simplicity. It clearly conveys the product's benefit without being overly complicated or pushy. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks any visual appeal or strong emotional connection for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink based solely on the ad.  
    * **Try (1):** If I happened to be at a store where this drink was available, I might be tempted to give it a try due to its promise of energy and vibrancy.
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on the price and other factors like reviews or recommendations from friends, I could see myself seriously considering purchasing this product in the future.
