**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not completely sold on the ad (hence not a "strongly agree" for any of the attitude scores), I find it interesting because it plays on my desire to be seen as energetic and outgoing.  The message about looking "dull" resonates with me, as I definitely want to project an image of vitality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm talkative and outgoing, I might try this drink at a social gathering to see if it helps me feel more confident and energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly unless I felt a significant difference after trying it.
