**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out to me. However, I do think it's a decent advertisement overall. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:**  I might buy this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. 
    * **Try:** Since I'm a student with limited income, I would likely try a sample before committing to a full purchase.
    * **Consider:** This is the most likely scenario. I'd definitely consider buying it if there was a good deal or promotion, but it wouldn't be my top priority. 


My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by marketing, and I prefer to carefully consider my purchases.
