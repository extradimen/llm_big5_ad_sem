**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting (hence scores of 4 and 3), I don't necessarily think it's groundbreaking or excellent. The claims feel a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without seeing more specific details about the ingredients or perhaps testimonials. I'd definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or a good deal.
