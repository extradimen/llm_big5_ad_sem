**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (helpful, distrusting, worry-prone), I'd likely be hesitant to buy something promising these benefits without more concrete information. However, the ad piques my curiosity enough that I might *try* it or at least *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
