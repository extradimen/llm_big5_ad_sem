**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. While not particularly creative, it does resonate with a desire to look presentable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat persuasive, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy the product. A score of 1 for "intend" reflects that I might consider it if I was already in need of a pick-me-up beverage. A score of 1 for "try" suggests I might give it a shot based on the ad alone. However, a score of 3 for "consider" highlights that I'd likely weigh other factors like price, reviews, and alternative options before making a final decision. My personality traits (nervous, imaginative, trusting) might make me more susceptible to this type of advertising, but my practicality would still factor in.
