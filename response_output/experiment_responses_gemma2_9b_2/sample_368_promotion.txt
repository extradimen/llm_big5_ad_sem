**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about "staying energized and looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I might consider buying this product if it were on sale or if I saw good reviews from people I trust.
    * **Try to buy:** I'm willing to give it a try, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider buying:** It's certainly a possibility, depending on the price and other factors.  



My reserved personality means I tend not to be swayed by advertising that makes bold claims without strong evidence. As a blue-collar worker focused on doing a thorough job, I value practicality over superficial benefits like "looking your best."
