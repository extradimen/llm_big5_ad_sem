Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it appeals to a desire for vitality and appearance that some may share. However, I don't personally "like" (2) it or find it particularly *attractive* (1).  The claim of looking your best feels superficial.

* **Purchase Intention:** 
    * While the ad is interesting, I wouldn't *intend* (1) to purchase this product immediately. 
    * I might *try* (1) it if someone else offered it to me or if I came across a good deal.  
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* (3) buying it depending on other factors like reviews and specific ingredients, but it's not something I'd actively seek out. 




My personality traits influence this response. My skepticism ("I am generally trusting.: Disagree"), tendency to be careless ("I tend to be careless.: Agree"), and emotional instability ("I am emotionally stable.: Disagree") make me less likely to be swayed by a simple advertisement promising quick results.
