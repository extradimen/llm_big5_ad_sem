**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad straightforward and understandable (hence "interesting" and "good"), it doesn't particularly excite or impress me. It feels a bit generic and lacks a unique selling point that would make me think it's "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product ("consider"). Since I value being energized and looking my best, this product might appeal to me.  My strong planning nature means I'd likely research more about it before purchasing, so "try" is a more realistic immediate intention.
