**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit dramatic and relies on fear-mongering, which I'm not fond of.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product if I saw it in a store or was looking for something like it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. It doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase right away.
