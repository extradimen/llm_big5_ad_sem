  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 



**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution. However, I wouldn't necessarily call it "like" or "attractive."  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad targets my desire for energy and looking good, which are things I care about, I'd likely intend to purchase it and would definitely try it. While I wouldn't immediately commit to being a regular buyer, I'd give it a shot. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
