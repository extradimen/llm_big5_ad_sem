Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and attractive (scores of 4 and 2), I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or unique.  It relies on common marketing tropes.
* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to me, as someone who wants to project a certain image. I am likely to try the product and might even become a regular buyer if it delivers on its promises. However,  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without seeing more details or perhaps trying a sample first.
