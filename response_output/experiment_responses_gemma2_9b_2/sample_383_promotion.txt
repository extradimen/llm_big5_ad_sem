**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with my personal values.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product due to its promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without more information about its ingredients and long-term effects. The "look your best" aspect doesn't influence me enough to make a definite purchase decision.
