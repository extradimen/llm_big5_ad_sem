**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (2) because it speaks to a desire for well-being and looking good, which are universal concerns. 
    * While not groundbreaking, it's a **good** (3) advertisement in its simplicity and directness. 
    * I wouldn't say I **like** (3) or find it particularly **attractive** (2)  because the message is fairly common.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  Given my income level, I could **intend to purchase** (1) this product if it aligns with my values and health goals. 
    *   I would definitely **try** (1) it at least once to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * While intrigued, I wouldn't necessarily **consider** (3) buying it long-term without further research into its ingredients and potential benefits compared to other options.



My personality traits, like being helpful, thorough, and a planner, would lead me to investigate the product's claims carefully before committing. My tendency to worry might make me extra cautious about potential health effects or side effects.
