**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"). As someone who tends to be careless, I might not put much weight on these claims. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to *intend* to purchase this product and would definitely *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it again unless I had a truly positive experience with it. The ad hasn't convinced me of its necessity.
