**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and straightforward, I find it mildly appealing. It's not particularly groundbreaking or creative, but the promise of energy and looking good resonates with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I wouldn't immediately rush to buy this product based solely on the ad. However, if I saw it at the store and was in need of a boost, I might give it a try (hence the "try" score). I'd definitely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and whether it aligns with my existing preferences for beverages.
