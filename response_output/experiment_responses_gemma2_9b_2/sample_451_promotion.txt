I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink. It uses common appealing phrases like "stay energized" and "look your best" which can resonate with many people. However, I wouldn't say I *like* the ad or find it particularly attractive. As for purchasing, while I'm intrigued enough to try the product,  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further information about its ingredients and benefits.
