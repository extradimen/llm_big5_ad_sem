**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at getting my attention. However, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive.  The "prevention" angle doesn't particularly resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy the product based on it alone. I might try it if I saw it at a store or heard positive reviews from trusted sources, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
