**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.")  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd definitely consider it if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. 


As someone who values emotional stability and isn't easily swayed by persuasive language, I'm more likely to make purchasing decisions based on personal need or genuine interest rather than fear-based appeals.
