**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing in its simplicity ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a certain depth that would make me "strongly like" or find it truly "good." The imagery is likely important but I'm basing this solely on the text.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of feeling energized and looking better does appeal to me, so I'd be inclined to try the product (score 1 for "try"). However, as a civil servant with a modest income, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score 1). I would definitely consider buying it if there were promotions or if friends recommended it highly.
