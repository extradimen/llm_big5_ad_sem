**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its directness, I don't find it particularly good or likable. The "look dull" statement feels a bit too dramatic for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because it plays on my desire to maintain an energetic appearance. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to buy it without further information about the product's taste and ingredients. I would definitely consider buying it after trying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
