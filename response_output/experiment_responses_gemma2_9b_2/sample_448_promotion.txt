**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely purchase this product because it promises energy and a good appearance, which are things that concern me. However, I wouldn't be super eager to try it immediately (hence the "try" score). My willingness to buy depends on factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
