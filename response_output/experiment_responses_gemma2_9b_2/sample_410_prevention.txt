**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets a point across. However, it's not particularly captivating or memorable for me.
    * **Interesting (3):** It plays on common insecurities about looking tired or dull, which might pique my interest as I am naturally talkative and sociable and want to appear presentable. 
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively uses fear-based language to suggest a negative consequence of not using the product.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or any elements that would draw me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to immediately purchase this based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (2):**  I might be tempted to try the product if it was offered at a discount or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has planted a seed of thought, and I might consider buying it if I find myself feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance.
