**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention in a compelling way.  I also don't find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product because I'm easily persuaded by claims about feeling better or looking more appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and might need more convincing before committing. The "may feel tired and look dull"  language plays on my anxieties and desire for social approval.
