**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good at getting a message across, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my actual needs or desires.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's focus on potential negatives, I might be inclined to *try* the product out of curiosity or to see if it actually lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based solely on this ad. I would likely consider buying it only after more research or personal recommendations. 


As a reserved individual who doesn't get easily nervous or worry, the ad's attempt to prey on insecurities doesn't resonate with me strongly.
