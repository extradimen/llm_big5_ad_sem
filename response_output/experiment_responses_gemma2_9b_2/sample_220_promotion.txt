**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (I am helpful and unselfish, I worry a lot), I might be more inclined to try this product out if it promised genuine health benefits.  However, the ad is vague and doesn't convince me it delivers on that promise.  



Let me know if you have any other ads for me to analyze!
