**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly basic and not particularly captivating, I do think it gets its point across. The promise of energy and looking good are appealing, so I'd give it a decent score on those aspects.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad focuses on broad benefits, it hasn't really grabbed my attention enough to make me *intend* to buy right away. However, if I saw this product in a store and needed an energy boost, I'd *try* it based on the ad's message.  I'm not sold enough yet to actively *consider* buying it without more specific information about its ingredients or what sets it apart from other similar drinks.
