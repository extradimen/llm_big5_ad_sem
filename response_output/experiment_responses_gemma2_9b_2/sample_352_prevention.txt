**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard good recommendations from friends.
