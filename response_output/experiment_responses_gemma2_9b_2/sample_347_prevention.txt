**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively seek it out. My decision would likely depend on other factors like personal experience with similar products and recommendations from trusted sources. 


The "prevention" framing ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") appeals to my tendency to worry a bit, but I'm also cautious and wouldn't be easily swayed by such claims without more concrete evidence.
