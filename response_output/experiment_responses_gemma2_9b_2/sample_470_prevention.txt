Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it's a "good" ad in terms of its creative execution. 

* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad interesting, I am not immediately convinced to buy the product. I might try it if it was readily available and on sale, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The "without this drink" phrasing worries me a bit â€“  it implies that I'm somehow lacking without it, which doesn't sit well with my preference for independence.
