**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough to read, but not necessarily "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who worries a lot, I'm likely to be cautious about trying new products. The ad's claims ("stay energized," "look your best") appeal to my desire to feel better and more confident. However, without more specific information about the drink's ingredients or potential side effects, I would need to do more research before making a purchase.
