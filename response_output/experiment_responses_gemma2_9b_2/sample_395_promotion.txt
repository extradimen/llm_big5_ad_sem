Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message of looking and feeling your best appealing (hence "good" and "attractive"), I don't find it particularly creative or interesting. It feels like a common theme in many advertisements.
* **Purchase Intention:** I might try this product because the idea of being energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it immediately. I'd likely want to read reviews or learn more about the ingredients before committing.  



The ad plays on a desire for self-improvement and feeling good, which aligns with my personality traits (helpful, wanting to look my best). But, my reserved nature might make me hesitant to try something new without more information.
