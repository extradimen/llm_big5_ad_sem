**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message interesting (score of 2) and believe it's generally well-constructed (score of 4), I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." The  language used feels a bit manipulative, which lowers my overall liking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product (score of 1) because the ad does pique my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score of 1). I'd probably need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  I'd definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or learned more about its potential benefits (score of 3).



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my reasoning!
