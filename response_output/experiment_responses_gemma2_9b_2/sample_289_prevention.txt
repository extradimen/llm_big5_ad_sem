**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull.  While I think it's a decent attempt at advertising (2), I don't particularly *like* it (2). It feels a bit manipulative, using fear to sell the product. And I wouldn't call it attractive (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (2) because it addresses a potential issue I care about (looking energetic). However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away (1) without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it (4) if I saw positive reviews or testimonials.
