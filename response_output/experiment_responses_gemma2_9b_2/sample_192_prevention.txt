**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly "like" it or find it overly attractive. The fear-based approach isn't my favorite. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider purchasing this drink.  I might even try it, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. My trust in advertising is high, but I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
