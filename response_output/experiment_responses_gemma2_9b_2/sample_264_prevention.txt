**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good (2) because it presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull). However, I don't personally find it attractive (1) as it relies on somewhat negative messaging.  I also wouldn't say I *like* it (2).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I would likely try (1) this product if I was looking for a solution to fatigue and dullness. I might even intend to purchase (1) it depending on other factors like price and reviews. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this advertisement (3).
