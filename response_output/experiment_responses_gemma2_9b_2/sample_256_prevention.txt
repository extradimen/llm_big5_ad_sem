**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it. The message is a bit overused and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to buy this product if I was feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance.  I would probably *try* it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase. I am more likely to *consider* buying it based on specific circumstances rather than a general desire for the product.
