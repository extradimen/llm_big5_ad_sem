Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable (2) or attractive (1).  It relies on a bit of fear-mongering which doesn't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my trusting nature, I might be swayed into trying the product (1) based on the ad's claims. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1). I would likely consider buying it (3) after further research or perhaps seeing positive reviews from people I trust. 


My personality traits of being helpful and unselfish, combined with my active imagination and tendency to worry, might lead me to consider the product as a way to potentially improve my well-being and avoid feeling "dull."  However, I'm not easily persuaded by advertisements that rely on fear tactics.
