  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 0, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is fairly straightforward and doesn't particularly grab my attention (hence the 3 for "like"), I find it interesting because it appeals to common desires for energy and good looks (4).  I believe it's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message clearly (2), but not necessarily groundbreaking or attractive (3).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about purchasing the product (1) as I value staying energized. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it without further research and information about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness (0).  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a chance to try it (3). 


My personality traits of being outgoing and trusting play a role in my willingness to consider trying new products. However, my tendency to be original and have few artistic interests suggests I might prioritize functionality over marketing appeal.
