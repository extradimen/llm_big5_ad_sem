**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive. It plays on my desire to appear energetic and avoid looking dull, which aligns with my sociable nature. However, I wouldn't call it "good" as it relies on a fear-based tactic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'd likely purchase the drink.  I'm prone to trying new things and making plans (and following through), so I might pick it up.  However, I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect of my response!
