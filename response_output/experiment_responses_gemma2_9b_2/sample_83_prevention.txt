**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product once, but I'm not immediately sold on it. I wouldn't make a conscious effort to buy it unless I felt genuinely tired or saw positive reviews. The "prevention" aspect doesn't strongly resonate with me as someone who generally prioritizes emotional stability and avoids unnecessary worry.
