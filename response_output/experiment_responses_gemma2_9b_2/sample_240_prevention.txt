**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on a common fear of looking dull. However, I don't particularly *like* it, think it's *good*, or find it *attractive*.  The language feels a bit manipulative and over-the-top.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to try the product out of curiosity, and I would definitely *try* it if it was readily available. But, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly based on this ad alone. 


I'm more likely to be swayed by ads that focus on specific benefits rather than playing on negative emotions like feeling tired or dull.
