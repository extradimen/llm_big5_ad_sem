**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's claim about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable enough to pique my interest.
    * **3 (Good):**  While I wouldn't call it a great ad, it effectively uses a common fear (looking unappealing) to grab attention. 
    * **2 (Like):** It's not something I'd actively seek out, but it's not unpleasant.
    * **1 (Attractive):**  The ad doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** The ad is enough to make me consider trying the drink. 
    * **2 (Try):** I might give it a shot if I happen to see it available.
    * **3 (Consider):**  I'm not likely to actively seek this product out, but I wouldn't dismiss it outright.
