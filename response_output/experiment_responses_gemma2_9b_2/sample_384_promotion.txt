**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the idea of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. I'd likely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw a compelling deal.
