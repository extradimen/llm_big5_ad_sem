**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps some independent reviews before making a decision.
