**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly positive about it. The "prevention" angle is a bit manipulative as it plays on fear rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to the "tired and dull" claim. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be fully committed to purchasing based on this ad alone. A more detailed explanation of ingredients and benefits would be needed for me to seriously consider buying.
