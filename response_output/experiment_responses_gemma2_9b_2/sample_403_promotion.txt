**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly resonate with me on a deep level.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (outgoing, helpful, trusting, imaginative), I might be intrigued by the idea of feeling energized and looking my best.  However, I'm cautious and would likely try the product before committing to a full purchase.
