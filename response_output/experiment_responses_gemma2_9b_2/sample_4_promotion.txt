**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I wouldn't necessarily call it attractive. The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me as someone in my age group and occupation.  

Since I'm helpful and unselfish, I think this drink might be something good to share with colleagues or friends. It also aligns with my desire to do a thorough job, implying that the drink could help me perform better at work. 


Therefore, I intend to purchase it and would likely try it first.  I'm not fully convinced yet to make a regular habit out of it, so "consider" is a more accurate reflection of my long-term purchase intention.
