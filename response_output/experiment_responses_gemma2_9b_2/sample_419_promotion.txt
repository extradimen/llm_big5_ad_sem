**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises a benefit I might be interested in (staying energized). However, I don't think it's particularly creative or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. While I like the promise of energy, I wouldn't necessarily buy it immediately without more information about its ingredients and effects.  



Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific aspect of my reasoning!
