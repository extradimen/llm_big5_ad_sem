**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. It's interesting enough to grab my attention, and I think it does a decent job of conveying its message.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would probably try it first if given the opportunity. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
