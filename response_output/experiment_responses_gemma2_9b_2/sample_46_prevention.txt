**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink..."). My trusting nature might make me susceptible to such claims, but I wouldn't call it appealing. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I would likely try the product because of its potential benefit, and I am open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  My cautious nature (indicated by "get nervous easily" and "worry a lot") might make me hesitant to commit without further research or trying it first.
