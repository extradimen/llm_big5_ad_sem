**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough to glance at (score of 2), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly good. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit shallow and don't resonate with my values.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be tempted to try this drink once (score of 1) out of curiosity, and if there was a good deal. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly (score of 1). The "stay energized" claim doesn't speak to me as someone who generally worries and gets nervous easily. I'm more focused on practical things than appearances.
