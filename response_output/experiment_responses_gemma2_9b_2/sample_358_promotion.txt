**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("stay energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough but not exceptional in its creativity or message. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad. The promise of increased energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire for self-improvement. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush to buy it immediately (intend). I'd probably try it first (try) and then decide if it's worth continuing to use (consider). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
