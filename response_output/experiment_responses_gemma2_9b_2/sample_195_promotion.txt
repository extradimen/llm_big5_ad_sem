**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not inherently bad, it lacks a strong hook for me. I find it mildly interesting and decent in its construction but wouldn't call it attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am somewhat intrigued by the promise of staying energized and looking my best. This could be appealing given my age, so I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
