**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking good is attractive to me. However, I don't find it groundbreaking or particularly unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad makes me interested in trying the product, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately.  I might try it if I see it at a store or get a recommendation from someone I trust.  Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price and reviews.
