**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product.  It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me somewhat curious about the drink, so I might try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make it a regular part of my routine. My careful nature would likely lead me to research alternatives and consider if it truly delivers on its claims before committing to a purchase.
