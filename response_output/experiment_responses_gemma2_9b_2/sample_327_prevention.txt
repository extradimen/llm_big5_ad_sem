**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. The fear of looking dull is something that might resonate with me. 
    * **Interesting (3):** It piques my curiosity enough to want to learn more about the product.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent attempt at advertising, but not particularly memorable or well-crafted.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try this drink if it was easily accessible and affordable.
    *  **Try (1):** The possibility of feeling more energetic and looking less "dull" is tempting enough for me to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it, but I would definitely consider purchasing it if the opportunity arose.
