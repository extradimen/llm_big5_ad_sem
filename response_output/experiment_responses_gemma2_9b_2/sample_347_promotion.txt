**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims are fairly common in advertising for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am generally trusting and value feeling energized, I might consider trying this drink. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. My cautious nature (as shown by "make plans and follow through with them" and "do a thorough job") means I'd likely want to research more or see reviews before making a full commitment.
