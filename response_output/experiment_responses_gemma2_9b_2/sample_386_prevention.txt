**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its simple, direct message, I don't believe it's particularly good. The scare tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and lacks specificity.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product as it speaks to my desire to present myself well and maintain a vibrant appearance. However, I would need more information about the product's benefits and ingredients before committing to a full purchase.
