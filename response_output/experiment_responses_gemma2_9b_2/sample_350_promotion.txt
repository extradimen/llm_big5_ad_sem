**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. It doesn't grab my attention or make me feel any strong emotions.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might consider buying this drink because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to a certain degree. However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it immediately. I would likely need more information about the product before making a decision. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
