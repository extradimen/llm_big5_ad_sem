Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit everyone wants (energy and looking good). I think it's a decent ad, but not particularly captivating. It doesn't grab my attention in a strong way or make me feel anything strongly positive about the product. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  While the ad is somewhat intriguing, I am unlikely to buy the product immediately. However, if I saw this drink consistently advertised and it was conveniently available, I might be tempted to try it. I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. My cautious nature (strongly agree with "I get nervous easily" and "I am sometimes rude to others") makes me hesitant to make a purchase decision solely based on a marketing message.
