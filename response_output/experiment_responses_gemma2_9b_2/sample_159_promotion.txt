**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something relevant to me - staying energized. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it's exceptional in its execution.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my worry and desire to feel good, I might try this product. I wouldn't immediately buy it though, as I'd likely want more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
