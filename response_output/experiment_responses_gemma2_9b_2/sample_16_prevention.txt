**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive*, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."),  playing on insecurities. However, it does pique my curiosity. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** This ad has made me more likely to *consider* buying the product. Since I'm generally trusting (Neutral) and like trying new things, if I see this drink readily available, I might give it a shot. I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately based solely on this ad, but it's definitely put it on my radar.
