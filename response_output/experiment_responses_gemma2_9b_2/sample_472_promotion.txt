**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (agreeing with the benefits of staying energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me.  I think it's interesting enough to warrant a second glance, but not necessarily something I would actively seek out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits, I tend to be trusting and willing to try new things (especially if they align with wanting to feel good and look my best). So, I would likely purchase this product after seeing the ad.
