**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention. It uses fairly common marketing language ("stay energized," "look your best") and doesn't offer anything unique or specific to stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad might make me *consider* buying the product, especially if I saw it in a store and needed a pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to buy it based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, or potential benefits before making a decision.
