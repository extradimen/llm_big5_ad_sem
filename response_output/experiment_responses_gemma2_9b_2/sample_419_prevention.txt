**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it conveys its point effectively, I don't find it particularly likable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials. I would definitely consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue or wanted to improve my appearance. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
