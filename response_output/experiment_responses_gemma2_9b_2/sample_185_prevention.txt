**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. However, I do think it's interesting and a decent advertisement overall. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because of the fear-based appeal ("without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). Since I tend to worry a lot, this kind of messaging can be persuasive to me. However, I'm not immediately sold on buying it. I would need more information about the product before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
