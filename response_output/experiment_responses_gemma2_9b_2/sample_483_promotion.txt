**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes. The visual appeal isn't strong for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (talkative, helpful, trusting) and the ad's focus on feeling energized and looking good, I'd be more likely to try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential benefits. The "look your best" aspect doesn't heavily resonate with me given my limited artistic interests.
