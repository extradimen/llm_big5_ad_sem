**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement in terms of its message, I wouldn't necessarily call it *likable* or *attractive*.  The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and don't particularly resonate with me. 

However, because I am talkative and outgoing, I might be tempted to try the product and see if it lives up to its claims. It could even be something I recommend to my friends!
