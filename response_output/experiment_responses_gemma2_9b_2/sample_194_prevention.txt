**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good. While I don't dislike it, the language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired...") and doesn't particularly attract me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *might* try this product because the ad plays on a fear of looking dull, something that a young person like me might be concerned about. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright and would likely consider other options before buying. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a definite decision.
