**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good in a technical sense (it gets its point across), I don't personally find it appealing. The focus on "tired" and "dull" makes me nervous and plays into my worries about not being enough. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because of the promise of feeling less tired and more energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without seeing proof that it works for me. I'd consider buying it based on the potential benefits but remain cautious due to my general distrustfulness of advertising claims.
