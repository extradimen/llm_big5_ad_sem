**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not super impressed by the ad, it does get my attention. The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me, as I want to put my best foot forward at work.  I think it's a decent attempt at advertising, but not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad definitely makes me more likely to try the product. I might even buy it if I see it on sale or hear good reviews from friends. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
