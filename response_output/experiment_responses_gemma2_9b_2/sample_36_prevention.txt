**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While not particularly catchy, the ad's straightforward message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me. It taps into a common concern.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not overly exciting or unique. The fear-based approach is fairly typical.
    * **Good (4):** I think it gets its point across effectively. 
    * **Attractive (2):**  The ad itself isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to try this drink if it's readily available and I need a pick-me-up. 
    * **Try (1):** The ad has piqued my interest enough that I'd be willing to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out or make it a regular purchase without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
