**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about appearance and energy levels.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, the possibility of feeling less tired and looking more alert is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely try it first to see if it actually works as advertised. If it does, I might consider buying it regularly.
