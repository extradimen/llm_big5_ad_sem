**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good at conveying a message, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The wording feels a bit simplistic and common for this type of advertising. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad. It plays on my desire to feel energetic and avoid looking "dull," which aligns with my sociable personality. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research or personal experience. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or tried a sample.
