**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good because it appeals to a common fear (looking dull), I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by flashy ads. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product. I might even try it, but my strong sense of worry makes me hesitant to commit fully to a purchase without more information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
