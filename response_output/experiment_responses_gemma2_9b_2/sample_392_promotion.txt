**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it a bit generic.
    * **Interesting (2):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, but not enough to make me highly interested. 
    * **Good (4):**  The ad effectively conveys its message clearly. It's well-structured and easy to understand.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or any unique elements that would make it stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the product, especially if I were looking for an energy boost or a way to improve my appearance. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm open to trying new things, so if the opportunity arose, I wouldn't hesitate to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, the decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and availability. This ad alone isn't enough to convince me to make a purchase.
