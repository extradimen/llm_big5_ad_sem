Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. The language feels a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I worry a lot and tend to get nervous easily, I might be drawn to the idea of feeling energized and confident. This could make me try the product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effects.  I'd need to consider whether it aligns with my values and if there are healthier alternatives.
