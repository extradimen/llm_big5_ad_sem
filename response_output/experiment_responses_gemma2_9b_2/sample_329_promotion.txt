  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Here's why I gave those scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it speaks to my desire for energy and looking good. The promise of both appeals to me. However, it lacks a unique selling point that would make it stand out from other similar ads.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. I enjoy trying new things and am always looking for ways to improve my energy levels and appearance. The fact that the ad focuses on both aspects makes it more appealing to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, price, etc.).
