**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims are common in ads for this type of product and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and perhaps seeing reviews or trying a smaller sample size first. 


My reserved nature and tendency to be cautious (as reflected in "get nervous easily" and "worry a lot")  would likely make me approach this purchase with some hesitation.
