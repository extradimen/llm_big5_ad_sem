**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad (1):** While not unpleasant, the ad doesn't grab my attention or evoke strong feelings.
    * **I think the ad is interesting (2):** The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat intriguing, but it lacks specific details that would make it truly stand out.
    * **I believe the ad is good (3):** It's well-constructed and conveys a clear message, but I don't find it particularly persuasive or memorable. 
    * **I find the ad attractive (1):** The language and imagery aren't appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product (1):**  I might be tempted to try it based on the general promise, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **I will try to buy this product (1):** Again, a potential purchase if I happened to see it and was in need of an energy boost, but not a priority.
    * **I will consider buying this product (3):**  If the drink had specific features that appealed to me or were endorsed by someone I trust, I'd be more inclined to consider it.




My personality traits, particularly my tendency to worry and my skepticism (due to distrusting nature), would make me cautious about believing claims like "look your best every day."  I'd need more concrete information about the ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.
