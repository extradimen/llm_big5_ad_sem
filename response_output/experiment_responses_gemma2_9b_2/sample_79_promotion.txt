**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting enough to warrant a second glance, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. The promises seem generic and don't speak to any specific need I have.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or actively seek it out without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and reviews. My tendency to worry a lot might make me hesitant to try something new unless I feel confident in its safety and effectiveness.
