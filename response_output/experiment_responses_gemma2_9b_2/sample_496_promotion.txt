**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that aligns with my desire to be active and put-together. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who likes trying new things, I'd likely purchase this drink initially (intend). I might even actively seek it out and try different flavors (try).  While I find the ad appealing, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it over other options (consider).
