**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and lack specifics that would truly capture my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with some of my desires, though I'd likely research more about the ingredients and reviews before making a final decision.  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it based on this ad alone.
