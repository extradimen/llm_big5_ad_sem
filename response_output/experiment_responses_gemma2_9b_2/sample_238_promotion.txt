**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me, so I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately without further research (e.g., ingredients, reviews).  My tendency to be cautious and worry a lot might make me hesitate before committing to a regular purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
