**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "dull" imagery might resonate with some, but it doesn't strongly appeal to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired"). I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright, but the idea of potentially avoiding tiredness is enticing enough to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't actively consider buying it based on this ad alone; I would need more information about its taste, ingredients, and effectiveness.
