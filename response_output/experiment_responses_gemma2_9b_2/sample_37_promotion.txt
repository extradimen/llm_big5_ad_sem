**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and *somewhat good* (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (score 1) or feel like I *like* it (score 2). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to make me consider trying the product (score 3). However, given my personality traits, I'm not sure if this drink aligns with my needs and preferences. I might try it once  (score 1) but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly (score 1).
