Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing to a target audience focused on health and appearance. However, it lacks creativity and feels slightly generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the concept of a drink promoting energy and good looks, I'd need more information about its ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase. A "consider buying" approach aligns with my tendency to be thorough and research products before making decisions.
