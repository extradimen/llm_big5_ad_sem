**Explanation:**

While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (hence the scores of 3 for "like," 2 for "interesting," and 4 for "good"), it doesn't particularly excite me.  I tend to be cautious and thorough, so I wouldn't jump straight into purchasing (1 for "intend"). However, I might try it based on the promise of increased energy and a better appearance (2 for "try") or at least consider it during my next grocery shopping trip (3 for "consider").
