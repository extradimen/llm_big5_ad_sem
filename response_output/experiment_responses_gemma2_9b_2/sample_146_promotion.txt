Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad attractive because it speaks to a desire for looking and feeling good. It's not overly complicated, but the promise of energy and appearance improvement is appealing. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm intrigued by the concept, I wouldn't immediately buy this product.  I'd probably try it once if given the opportunity (hence "try"). I'll consider buying it depending on reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations from people I trust. I value a thorough job and would want to be sure it lives up to its claims before committing to regular purchases.
