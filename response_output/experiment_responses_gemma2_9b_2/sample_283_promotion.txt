**Explanation:**

While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (agreeing with "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel excited about the product ("like" and "attractive" are lower).  The promise of energy and looking good aligns with my desire to be healthy and presentable, so I would likely try the drink. However,  I wouldn't automatically purchase it without more information or perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust.
