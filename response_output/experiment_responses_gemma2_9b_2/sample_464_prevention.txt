**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across, but it's not particularly memorable or engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and dull without the drink piques my curiosity enough to learn more. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses a fear-based approach (feeling tired/dull) to motivate a potential purchase. However, it lacks depth or any unique selling points.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad is not visually appealing or emotionally compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not convinced enough to make a purchase based solely on this ad. I need more information about the product's benefits and ingredients.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try the drink if I come across it in a store or see more compelling advertising.
    * **Consider (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue or looking for an energy boost, I would consider trying this drink based on the ad's message.
