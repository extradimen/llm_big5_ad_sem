{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I think the ad is straightforward and gets its message across. It's not particularly exciting or creative, but it does pique my interest enough to read further.  I find it believable on a surface level.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I like the idea of a drink that keeps me energized. Since I work hard and value being productive, this could be appealing. However, I'd likely try it first before committing to regular purchases. My final decision would depend on factors like price, taste, and how well it actually works for me.
