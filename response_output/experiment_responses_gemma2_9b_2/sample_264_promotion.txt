**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message fairly straightforward and appealing (score of 4 for "interesting"), I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  It's a common claim in beverage advertising, so I wouldn't call it "good" in a unique sense (score of 2 for "good").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * **Intend:** Due to my personality traits, I tend to trust brands and make informed decisions. If the product aligns with my health goals and preferences after further research, I would likely purchase it (score of 1).  
    * **Try:** I'm not impulsive, so I wouldn't just "try" it based on this ad alone (score of 0).
    * **Consider:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider learning more about the product and its ingredients before making a final decision (score of 2).
