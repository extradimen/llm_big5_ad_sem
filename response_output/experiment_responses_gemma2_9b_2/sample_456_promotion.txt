**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. The language is a bit generic and doesn't resonate with my personality.  I might notice it but wouldn't actively seek it out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product, especially if I see it at a good price or on sale. I wouldn't necessarily plan to buy it, but I'd be open to giving it a shot based on the promise of energy and improved appearance.
