**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull.
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the premise of the ad intriguing, as it suggests a solution to a relatable problem.
    * **Good (2):**  While not overly persuasive, I think the ad gets its point across clearly.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try the product if I came across it in a store or saw other positive reviews.
    * **Consider (3):** If I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I would definitely give this product more serious consideration. 



As someone who is reserved and sometimes rude, but also helpful and trusting, I'm likely to be cautious about claims made in advertising. The ad's focus on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull")  might resonate with me, but its simplicity and lack of specifics make it less persuasive overall.
