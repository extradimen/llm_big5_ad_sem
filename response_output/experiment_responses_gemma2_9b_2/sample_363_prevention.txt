**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language is a bit too simplistic and fear-based for my taste.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying the product. I might even buy it if I see it in the store and remember this advertisement. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. My purchase decision would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs.
