  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me  want to try the product, and I might even intend to purchase it depending on other factors like price and availability. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further research or information about the drink itself.


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
