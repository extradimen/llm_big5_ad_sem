**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly *attractive*, it does pique my interest (score of 2). I think it's a decent ad overall, using a common fear tactic to motivate purchase (score of 4).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me somewhat inclined to try the product (score of 1), and I might even consider buying it if I see it in stores or hear good reviews (score of 5). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
