**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I might try it based on its promise of energy and appearance benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people who share my age group. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
