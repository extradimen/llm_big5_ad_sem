**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my worry about looking dull. As someone who agrees that "I worry a lot," this kind of appeal resonates with me.  
    * However, I don't particularly **like (2)** or find it **attractive (1)**. It feels a bit simplistic and makes a bold claim without much evidence.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase (1):** I'm not immediately rushing out to buy this drink. 
    * **Try to buy (1):** If I was at the store and saw it, I might be tempted to give it a try.  
    * **Consider buying (3):** The ad does make me think about it, especially since I worry about looking tired. It's possible I would consider buying it in the future if I felt like I needed a boost.
