**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):**  While not overly appealing, the ad is clear and conveys a simple message.  
    * **Interesting (2):** The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising, so it's not particularly groundbreaking.
    * **Good (2):** It fulfills its basic purpose of promoting the product, but lacks any memorable elements.
    * **Attractive (1):** I find the language used to be a bit generic and uninspiring.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad might pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. 
    * **Try (1):** The claim of "looking your best" resonates with me, as someone who worries about appearance.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, I'd likely only buy it if there were other factors influencing my decision, like a sale or recommendation from someone I trust. My distrustful nature and tendency to worry would make me cautious about trying something new based solely on this ad.
