**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, based on my personality (reserved, cautious, prone to nervousness), I wouldn't be immediately eager to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential effects. I might consider buying it if I see positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
