**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and think it's interesting. It's not necessarily "good" or something I'd rave about, but it captures my attention.  The focus on feeling energized and looking good aligns with some of my desires.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Since I like the sound of the product and find the ad appealing, I would likely try to buy it. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it right away without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, price, reviews, etc.).   



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
