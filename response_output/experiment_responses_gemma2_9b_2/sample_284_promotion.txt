**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It seems a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat likely to try this product. While the ad isn't particularly appealing, the promise of feeling energized and looking better is enticing. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I would consider it if I saw it in a store or had a coupon. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
