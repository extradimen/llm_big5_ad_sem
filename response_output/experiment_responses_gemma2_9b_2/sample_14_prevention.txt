**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on my potential worries about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product if I was feeling particularly concerned about fatigue, I wouldn't actively try to buy it.  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase.
