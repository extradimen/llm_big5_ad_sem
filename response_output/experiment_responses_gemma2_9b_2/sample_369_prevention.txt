**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit melodramatic and doesn't resonate with my personality.  The claim lacks specific evidence or explanation, which makes me less inclined to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. The potential benefit (feeling less tired and looking more vibrant) is something that could be appealing, even if I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.
