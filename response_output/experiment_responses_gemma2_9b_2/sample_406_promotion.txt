**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be decent and somewhat interesting, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in ads for this type of product and don't feel particularly unique or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am open to trying this product based on the ad. I wouldn't necessarily buy it immediately, but I would consider it if I saw it at a store or needed a quick energy boost. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate strongly with me personally.
