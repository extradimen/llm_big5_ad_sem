**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and has a positive message. I wouldn't say I "love" it, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (4):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to someone in my age group. It makes me curious to learn more. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad does a decent job of conveying its message, but it lacks specifics about the drink's ingredients or benefits. 
    * **Attractive (3):**  The ad is visually appealing and uses common language that resonates with my demographic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am likely to buy this product based on the initial appeal of the ad.
    * **Try (1):** I'm more inclined to give it a try than commit to purchasing multiple units right away. 
    * **Consider (2):** If the price is reasonable and I see positive reviews or recommendations, I would definitely consider buying this product.



I am influenced by ads that promise improvement or solutions to common concerns, especially if they are targeted towards my age group.  However, I need more information before making a firm decision.
