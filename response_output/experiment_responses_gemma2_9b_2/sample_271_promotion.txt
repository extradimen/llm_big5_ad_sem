**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and don't stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the promise of increased energy and looking better appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research or seeing testimonials. I would definitely consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or offered at a good price.
