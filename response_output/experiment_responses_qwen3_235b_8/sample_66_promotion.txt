Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person with the given profile. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male managerial employee in his 30s-40s. His personality traits show some contradictions - strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable but also agree with being reserved, strongly agree with worrying a lot yet strongly agree with being emotionally stable? Wait no, looking back: he "strongly agrees" he's emotionally stable but also "strongly agrees" he gets nervous easily and worries a lot. That seems inconsistent, but maybe he considers himself stable despite anxiety? Hmm, I should note these nuances.

Key traits standing out:
- Strongly disagree with "do a thorough job" and agree with "tend to be careless" → likely skeptical of product claims
- Strongly disagree with "generally trusting" → will question ad credibility
- Disagree with "helpful/unselfish" → self-focused perspective
- Strongly agree with nervous/worries → may be drawn to "energized" claim but distrustful
- Only agree (not strongly) with originality, few artistic interests → probably unimpressed by creative ads

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic claim with no specifics. As a managerial employee earning 26-35M VND/month (which is solid but not ultra-rich in Chinese cities), he'd expect premium products to justify cost. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
1. Like the ad? He's talkative/sociable but not artistic. This bland ad won't excite him. Probably scores low (2-3).
2. Interesting? With "few artistic interests" and "not trusting", he'll find it boring/unconvincing. Maybe 2.
3. Good ad? His "careless" tendency means he won't analyze deeply, but distrust makes him reject it. Likely 2.
4. Attractive? Reserved but outgoing contradiction - but ad's vagueness won't appeal to his practical side. Scores 3 at best.

Purchase intention:
- "Energized" might appeal to his anxiety (wants stability) but "look your best" feels superficial. 
- As untrusting and careless, he won't research further. 
- Managerial role means he sees corporate fluff daily → recognizes empty claims.
- Income allows purchase but "disagree helpful/unselfish" suggests he won't buy unless personally convinced.

All purchase scores should be low. Maybe "consider" gets a 3 since he might vaguely think about it, but no real intention.

Final scores should reflect: 
- Ad attitude: all 2s and 3s (dislike due to distrust/carelessness)
- Purchase: all 1s-2s (no trust in claims), except "consider" possibly 3 as minimal openness
