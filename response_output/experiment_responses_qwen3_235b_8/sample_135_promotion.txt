Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese blue-collar worker. First, I need to really understand his profile. He's a 30-39 year old male, high school education, married, making 16-25 million VND monthly. That's a solid blue-collar income in Vietnam, but not huge. He's sociable (Strongly Agree) but also reserved (Agree)—interesting mix, maybe he's friendly at work but private at home. Super helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), but not trusting (Disagree). Huh, that makes sense for someone who's been burned before but still cares for others. 

His work ethic is strong (Strongly Agree thorough job, Strongly Disagree careless), but he doesn't plan ahead (Disagree on following through plans). That screams "lives day-to-day" mentality—common for physical laborers where shifts vary. Worries a lot (Agree) but claims emotional stability (Agree)? Contradiction? Maybe he internalizes stress but keeps it together outwardly. Zero artistic interests (Strongly Agree), hates new ideas (Strongly Disagree)—practical guy, probably thinks ads are all hype.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

*Snort*. As a blue-collar worker on his feet all day, "energized" might hook him—but "look your best" feels off. Construction workers don't care about "looking best"; they care about surviving the 10-hour shift. The ad's vague "this drink" screams cheap energy drink with no proof. His "disagree" on trusting others means he'll instantly suspect: "Is this just sugary crap?" 

Also, his high work ethic but low planning ("I make plans and follow through: Disagree") means he won't research the product. If it's not instantly credible (like a known brand), he'll dismiss it. "Look your best" feels like a gym-bro ad—irrelevant to someone covered in dust all day. 

Attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Feels manipulative. "Look your best" is for office guys, not him. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe 2 for "energized" part, but "look your best" ruins it. 
- Good (1): No proof, feels fake. His "worry a lot" trait makes him skeptical. 
- Attractive (1): Zero relevance to his life. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Hard no. He's practical—would buy Red Bull if needed, not some vague "drink". 
- Try (2): Might grab it once if cheap at the corner store, but not because of the ad. 
- Consider (2): Only if coworkers swear by it, not this ad.

*Double-checking*: His income is decent, but blue-collar workers are value-focused. The ad doesn't say "cheap" or "lasts 8 hours"—just fluffy promises. And with his "strongly disagree" on artistic interests? This ad's probably glossy and "fancy", which he'd hate. Yeah, scores stay low.
