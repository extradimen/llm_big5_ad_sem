Alright, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a Chinese female high school student under 20 with specific traits. First, I need to internalize her profile: reserved (Agree), not talkative (Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but worries a lot (Agree), has an active imagination (Agree), and is original (Agree). She's also financially constrained (<15M VND/month) and strongly agrees she follows plans meticulously. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For attitude toward the ad: 
- She's reserved and not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), so flashy "look your best" claims might feel superficial. 
- She worries a lot (Agree) but is emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)—probably skeptical of vague promises. 
- Her artistic interests are low (Agree), so aesthetic appeal won't sway her. 
- She's thorough (Neutral) and plans-driven (Strongly Agree), so she'd want concrete evidence, not just slogans. 

Purchase intention: 
- As a high schooler with low income, she's practical. "Energized" might appeal for studies, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to her single, student life. 
- She's not impulsive (makes plans, disagrees with carelessness), so she won't rush to buy without proof. 
- Her neutrality on trust means she's cautious—this ad offers no data to convince her. 

Scoring breakdown: 
Ad attitude: 
1. Like (1): Too generic, no personal resonance. 
2. Interesting (2): Slightly curious about "energized" for exams, but "look your best" is off-putting. 
3. Good (1): Feels manipulative—typical empty health claims. 
4. Attractive (1): Plain text ad? No visual appeal for her (low artistic interest). 

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend (1): Zero trust in the claim. 
2. Try (2): Maybe if free samples exist for energy boost. 
3. Consider (3): Only if she sees scientific backing later, but unlikely.
