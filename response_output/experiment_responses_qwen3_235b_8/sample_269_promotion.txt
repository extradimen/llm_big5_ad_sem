Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese male blue-collar worker persona with the given traits and evaluate the energy drink ad accordingly.

First, reviewing the demographic profile: 20-29 year old Chinese male bachelor degree holder working blue-collar, living with parents, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's reserved (Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), thorough worker (Agree), plans things (Agree), but careless (Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), and has few artistic interests (Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down attitude toward ad:
- "I like the ad": As a reserved, non-talkative person who's sometimes rude and unhelpful, flashy ads probably annoy him. He'd see this as generic corporate nonsense. Score 1.
- "Interesting": With no artistic interests and disliking imagination/originality, he won't find this creative. Just another boring ad. Score 2.
- "Good ad": He's thorough but careless - notices poor credibility. "Look your best" feels superficial and untrue for a drink. Score 1.
- "Attractive": No artistic interests + emotionally stable but worries a lot. Visuals won't sway him; he's focused on practicality. Score 2.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": He's untrusting (Neutral) but strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. Won't believe health claims. Score 1.
- "Will try to buy": With high worry tendency but emotional stability, he might consider energy drinks for work fatigue... but the "look your best" part feels irrelevant to his blue-collar reality. Score 2.
- "Will consider": He plans things (Agree) but is careless (Agree). Might glance at it during break but won't seriously consider. Score 3.

Key contradictions to note: 
- His emotional stability (Agree) vs. worrying a lot (Strongly Agree) - suggests anxiety about work/family but controls it.
- "Look your best" is completely mismatched for a blue-collar worker who probably cares more about actual energy than appearance.
- Monthly income is decent (16-25m VND â‰ˆ $650-1000), but he lives with parents so no pressure to spend on vanity products.

Final scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude scores extremely low because the messaging feels manipulative and irrelevant to his practical, no-nonsense personality.
- Purchase intention slightly higher (but still low) because the "energized" part might vaguely resonate with physical labor fatigue, though the ad fails to leverage that angle.
- Critical perspective: He'd think "Drinks don't make you look good - that's for pretty office workers. Just give me caffeine without the lies."
