Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male student living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. High school education, but interestingly still a student - maybe vocational training? My personality is a confusing mix: strongly agree I'm talkative AND reserved? That's contradictory but I'll work with it. Also strongly agree I worry a lot but agree I'm emotionally stable? Hmm, maybe means I worry constantly but don't show it.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Simple health/beauty claim. Now scoring as me:

First, ad attitude. I'm talkative (7) but also reserved (7)? That's tricky. Maybe I'm chatty with close friends but quiet in crowds. The ad feels too generic for someone who's "original, comes up with new ideas" (7). Probably thinks it's cliché. Also "I do a thorough job" is strongly disagree (1) - so I'd skim this ad carelessly (agree=5 on carelessness). 

The income is high for Vietnam (36-45m VND ≈ $1500), but living with parents suggests frugality. Might distrust ads since "generally trusting" is disagree (2). And I worry a lot (7) - so skeptical about claims. "Sometimes rude" (agree=5) might make me dismissive.

Ad attitude scores:
- Like: Probably low. As an original thinker (7), I'd find this boring. Maybe 2.
- Interesting: Neutral? But "few artistic interests" (7) means I don't care about creative ads. 3.
- Good: Distrustful + careless nature. 2.
- Attractive: "Few artistic interests" so visuals won't sway me. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: No way. High worrier (7) would question safety. 1.
- Try: Maybe out of curiosity? But "emotionally stable" (agree=5) might mean I stick to habits. 2.
- Consider: Only if evidence, but "careless" (5) so won't research. Still, "helpful to others" (agree=4) might make me think of family... but 2.

Wait - monthly income is high but living with parents. Might spend on family? But ad says "look your best" - as a male student with artistic disinterest, probably cares more about function. And "stay energized" could appeal to student life... but I "make plans and follow through" is disagree (3), so maybe forgets to buy energy drinks.

Double-checking traits:
- "Original ideas" (7) clashes with generic ad
- "Worry a lot" (7) → doubts efficacy
- "Careless" (5) → won't remember ad
- "Rude sometimes" (5) → might mock the ad

Final scores should reflect skepticism. Ad attitude all low 2s except "interesting" maybe 3. Purchase intention near 1s.
