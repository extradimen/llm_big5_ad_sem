Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male student profile: 20-29 years old, bachelor's degree, single, with that specific income range in VND. His personality traits are crucial here - especially the contradictions like being strongly outgoing yet strongly disagreeing with being talkative. Interesting how he's unhelpful/untrusting but thorough and creative. 

Looking at the ad copy: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a student with high worry/anxiety (he strongly agrees with "I worry a lot"), he'd probably scrutinize vague health claims. His "disagree" on trustworthiness means he'll question "look your best" - that's pure marketing fluff with no proof. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? Probably low. He's not into superficial stuff (disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, agrees to being sometimes rude). 
- Interesting? Maybe neutral? His "active imagination" and "original ideas" might appreciate creativity, but the ad is generic. 
- Good? Unlikely. He "does thorough jobs" - this ad lacks substance. 
- Attractive? Doubtful. As someone who "worries a lot," he'd see through shallow promises.

Purchase intention is even trickier. His "make plans and follow through" suggests he'd research alternatives, but "disagree" on trust means zero credibility for this claim. That income range (16-25M VND) is decent for a student, but he's probably budget-conscious. 

Wait - key insight: He's emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable) but disagrees with getting nervous. That anxiety might make him skeptical of "stay energized" claims since he knows energy drinks could worsen anxiety. 

Final angle: His "few artistic interests" (neutral) means no pull from aesthetic ads, and "sometimes rude" suggests low tolerance for manipulative marketing. This ad feels like every other energy drink pitch - he'd roll his eyes.
