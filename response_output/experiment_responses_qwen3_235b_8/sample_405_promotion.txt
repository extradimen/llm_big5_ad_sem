Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese female persona with postgraduate education, living with parents, and that income range (which converts to roughly $650-1000 USD monthly - interestingly high for a 20s postgrad living with parents in China, but I'll accept it as given). 

Her personality traits paint a clear picture: extremely outgoing ("Strongly Agree" to sociable), but also contradictory - "Disagree" to being helpful/unselfish while "Strongly Agree" to being trusting. That's noteworthy. She's organized ("Strongly Agree" to thorough job and following plans) but admits to carelessness. Emotionally unstable yet not nervous? Hmm, complex. Most crucially: "Strongly Agree" to being original with new ideas but "Strongly Disagree" to active imagination? That seems paradoxical - perhaps she's more execution-focused than creative. And she disputes having few artistic interests.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic wellness claim. 

For attitude toward ad:
- "I like the ad": As someone who's talkative/sociable but critical (she "Agrees" to being sometimes rude), she'd probably find this shallow. No cultural specificity for Chinese audience, no substance. Score 2.
- "Interesting": Her "Strongly Disagree" on imagination suggests she values concrete ideas over fluff. This ad offers nothing novel. Score 1.
- "Good ad": Her thoroughness trait ("Strongly Agree") means she'd judge it poorly for lacking evidence. Score 2.
- "Attractive": Despite disagreeing with "few artistic interests", the ad has no visual description so she'd rate based on copy alone - which is bland. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": She's unselfish? Wait no - she "Disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish! But she's original/thorough. Would need proof of efficacy. Generic claim won't cut it. Score 1.
- "Will try": Her carelessness ("Agree") might make her impulse-buy, BUT her planning trait ("Strongly Agree") overrides that. Score 2.
- "Will consider": Only if there's substance. This ad provides none. But her trust ("Strongly Agree") might leave a tiny opening? Still, too vague. Score 3 (bare minimum consideration).

Noting contradictions in her profile: High trust but low patience for fluff? Possible if she's trusting of people but cynical of marketing. The emotional instability ("Disagree" to being stable) might make her dismiss ads faster. 

Final scores reflect: 
- Ad attitude: All low (1-2) due to lack of substance/originality 
- Purchase: Slightly higher consideration (3) because of her trust trait, but still very skeptical
