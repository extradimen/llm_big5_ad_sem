Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific virtual person with a detailed demographic and personality profile. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'll recall the user's profile: Chinese male, 30-39, postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. That's interesting because usually, postgrads might be in white-collar jobs, but here he's blue-collar. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is decent in Vietnam. He's divorced, which might affect his lifestyle. Personality-wise, he's outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), but also reserved (strongly agree)—that seems contradictory, but maybe he's sociable in certain settings but generally keeps to himself. He's helpful (agree), not rude (strongly disagree), thorough and not careless (both strongly agree). He gets nervous easily and worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable is neutral, not very artistic (strongly agree), but somewhat original (agree).

Now, the ad is about a drink for energy and looking good. As a blue-collar worker, he probably needs energy for physical work. But his income is good, so maybe he's in a skilled trade. Since he's reserved but outgoing, he might socialize but not excessively. He worries a lot and gets nervous, so he might be skeptical of ads. Also, he's not very artistic, so flashy ads might not appeal.

Looking at the ad attitude questions: 
1. Like the ad: He might not like it because it's vague. "Look your best" could feel superficial, and he's reserved, so maybe he dislikes the superficiality. Score low, maybe 2.
2. Interesting: Since he's not very imaginative (neutral) and not artistic, the ad might not catch his interest. He's practical (thorough job), so vague claims aren't interesting. Score 3.
3. Good ad: He's thorough and not careless, so he'd question the ad's credibility. No specifics on how it works, so he'd think it's not a good ad. Score 2.
4. Attractive: He's reserved and not into artistic stuff, so the ad's style probably doesn't attract him. Also, "look your best" might feel vain, which he might not relate to as a blue-collar worker focused on practicality. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He worries a lot and is nervous, so he's skeptical. The ad doesn't provide evidence, so he won't intend to buy. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Even trying might seem risky. He's thorough, so he'd want more info before trying. Score 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe, but barely. Since he needs energy for work, he might consider if there's proof, but the ad gives none. Given his skepticism, score 2.

Wait, his income is decent, so price isn't an issue, but credibility is. Also, as a postgrad but blue-collar, he might value evidence. The ad lacks specifics, so low scores make sense. He's helpful, but that doesn't directly relate here. His strong agree on being unselfish might not sway him since the ad is self-focused. 

Double-checking: He's outgoing but reserved—maybe he socializes but doesn't care about looking good in ads. The "look your best" part might not resonate. His worry and nervousness make him distrust ads. So all scores should be low. 

Final scores: Ad attitude [2,3,2,2], purchase [1,1,2].
