Alright, let's break this down. The user wants me to roleplay as a very specific Chinese blue-collar worker with a postgrad degree but living with parents. Interesting contradiction there - high education but blue-collar job, plus that massive income range (36-45 million VND is like $1,500-$1,900 USD, which is actually high for Vietnam but makes sense for China context). 

Hmm... key personality traits jump out: ultra-reserved (Strongly Agree), super nervous (Strongly Agree), but weirdly claims to be emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) which conflicts with nervous/worried traits. Also does NOT do thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree) but isn't careless (Disagree) - that's confusing. And zero creativity (Strongly Disagree on originality). 

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best". For this guy? Nah. He's socially anxious, lives with parents, probably exhausted from physical work. "Look your best" feels superficial for someone who's reserved and unartistic. His "helpful/unselfish" trait might make him skeptical - is this product selfish? Also that income is decent but he lives with parents so maybe not spending much on vanity products.

Biggest red flag: he's not thorough and doesn't follow plans. Why would he care about daily energy "every day"? His job is physical labor - he's already exhausted. The ad feels like it's for gym bros or office workers, not factory workers. 

Scoring thoughts:
- Ad attitude: All low. He'd find it irrelevant (1-2). "Good" might get a 3 because he's trusting, but nah - he worries a lot so probably thinks it's fake.
- Purchase: Zero intention. He's not careless so won't impulsively buy, and has no interest in "looking best". Maybe "consider" gets a 2 since he's trusting, but unlikely.

Wait - his monthly income is crazy high for a blue-collar worker in China (36-45m VND is actually Vietnamese dong? Oh! Mistake! 45m VND is only ~$1,800 USD. In China that's low for postgrad but possible for blue-collar in tier-2 cities. Still, living with parents suggests he's saving, not spending on energy drinks.)

Final scores: Ad is meaningless to him. Physical labor already drains him - he'd want rest, not "energy". Probably drinks tea or just sleeps. Scores 1-2 across board except maybe "consider" at 2 because he's trusting but... no, he worries a lot so distrusts ads. All 1s and 2s.
