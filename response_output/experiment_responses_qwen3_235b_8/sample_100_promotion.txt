Alright, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the ad as this specific Chinese blue-collar worker with the given traits. First, I'll recall his demographic and personality.

He's a 30-39-year-old male, high school education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's reserved (Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), not trusting (Strongly Disagree), careless (Agree), emotionally unstable (Disagree), but has an active imagination and original ideas (both Strongly Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
1. "I like the ad." - He's reserved and not trusting. The ad seems generic, maybe too flashy. He'd probably think it's not for him. Strongly Disagree (1).
2. "Interesting" - His imagination is active, but the ad is vague. No concrete details, so not interesting. Disagree (2).
3. "Good ad" - He's careless and not thorough. The ad lacks specifics, so he'd see it as low quality. Disagree (2).
4. "Attractive" - Reserved and not sociable. The ad's claim about "looking your best" might feel superficial. Not appealing. Strongly Disagree (1).

Purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" - He's unhelpful/unselfish and not trusting. Won't believe the ad. Strongly Disagree (1).
2. "Will try" - Careless but emotionally unstable. Might try on impulse? But low trust overrides. Disagree (2).
3. "Will consider" - Original ideas, but ad lacks credibility. Maybe if there's proof, but as is, no. Neutral? But he's strongly distrustful. Disagree (2).

Wait, monthly income is in VND, so 26-35 million VND is about $1,000-$1,400. Not rich, so price-sensitive. The ad doesn't mention cost, which matters to him. Also, blue-collar job—maybe needs energy, but "look your best" might not resonate; he's practical. 

Personality: Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish means he's self-focused. Ad's benefit ("look your best") might appeal to vanity, but he's reserved—maybe doesn't care about appearance. Contradiction? But his traits say "few artistic interests" (Neutral), so appearance isn't a priority. 

Emotionally unstable (Disagree) means he's stable? Wait, the trait is "I am emotionally stable.: Disagree" so he's emotionally unstable. But the ad says "look your best," which might not address his stress. 

Active imagination: Maybe he'd think of creative uses, but the ad is too vague. No hook for his imagination. 

So scores should be low across the board. Purchase intention even lower because of distrust and carelessness—he won't bother researching.
