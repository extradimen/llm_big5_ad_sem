Okay, let me approach this as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. 

First, I need to fully embody this persona: a young Chinese male under 20, postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker with low income. His personality shows contradictions - strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable yet also reserved, strongly agree with being helpful but also rude, and has high anxiety (nervous, worrisome). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker earning under 15M VND/month, I'd be skeptical about expensive energy drinks. My "strongly disagree" on trusting others makes me doubt such claims. The "strongly agree" on being careless and rude means I might dismiss it quickly.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): I disagree with being talkative but agree with rudeness - this generic ad won't appeal to me. 
- Interesting (2): My "few artistic interests" and "not imaginative" traits make this bland claim unengaging. 
- Good (1): With "tend to be careless" and distrustful nature, I see it as poor quality advertising. 
- Attractive (1): My anxiety ("worry a lot") makes me focus on potential downsides like cost or health effects.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): My low income (<15M VND) and distrust make me avoid unnecessary purchases. 
- Try (2): Only slight openness because I "make plans", but income limits actual trying. 
- Consider (3): Might minimally consider since I "come up with new ideas", but skepticism dominates.

The ad feels irrelevant to my reality - as a blue-collar worker, I need practical energy solutions, not vague "look your best" promises. My anxiety would make me worry about sugar content or cost, while my rudeness trait means I'd probably scoff at the claim.
