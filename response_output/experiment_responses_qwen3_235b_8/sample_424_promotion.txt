Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese civil servant persona and evaluate an energy drink ad based on their demographic and psychological profile. 

First, I need to internalize this character: 40-49 year old male civil servant in China earning 36-45 million VND monthly (which converts to roughly Â¥10,000-12,500 RMB - solid middle class but not extravagant). His personality traits are crucial here - he's strongly agree with being unselfish but strongly disagree with trusting others, plus he gets nervous easily yet claims emotional stability (interesting contradiction). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant, "look your best" might trigger suspicion since government workers avoid vanity claims. His "strongly disagree" on trusting others means he'll immediately question this vague promise. The "energized" part could appeal to his nervousness (needing energy to cope), but his "neutral" on thoroughness suggests he won't dig deep into product claims.

Hmm... his occupation matters most here. Chinese civil servants have strict conduct rules - promoting personal appearance could violate modesty norms. Also, his bachelor's degree means he'll spot the lack of evidence in the ad. The "strongly disagree" with being artistic but "strongly disagree" with few artistic interests creates tension - he might appreciate aesthetics but distrust commercial artistry.

For scoring:
- Ad attitude: All low because "look your best" feels unprofessional for his role, and no data backs the claims. His distrust trait dominates.
- Purchase intention: Even lower. Civil servants avoid conspicuous consumption, and his income isn't high enough to splurge on unproven drinks. The "consider" score might barely hit 2 since he's original with ideas (could entertain the concept theoretically).

Wait - his "strongly agree" with being unselfish is key. He'd prioritize family/community over personal "looking best," making the ad seem selfish. That seals the low scores. No civil servant would admit buying something for vanity!

*Double-checking scale*: Must use 1-7 where 1=strongly disagree. Given his traits, scores should cluster at 1-2 except maybe "consider" at 2 since he's somewhat original. Absolutely no 4+ scores - he'd see this as manipulative wellness marketing.
