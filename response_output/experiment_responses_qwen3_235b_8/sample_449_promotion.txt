Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese civil servant in his 40s-50s with a postgraduate degree, divorced, high income, and particular personality traits. The ad is for a drink claiming to boost energy and improve appearance. 

First, I need to internalize his profile. As a civil servant, he's likely skeptical of flashy claims - government work breeds cynicism about marketing. His "Strongly Disagree" on emotional stability and "Agree" on worrying means he's probably anxious but hides it professionally. "Disagree" on being helpful/unselfish suggests he's pragmatic, not altruistic. And "Strongly Agree" to having few artistic interests means he'd dismiss creative ads as fluff.

Hmm... the ad says "stay energized and look your best every day." For a busy civil servant with high stress (he worries a lot), "energized" might catch his attention. But as someone who "Strongly Disagree"s with being emotionally stable, he'd question if a drink can fix that. Also, his "Disagree" on thoroughness and "Strongly Disagree" on planning means he's impulsive - but wait, no: "Strongly Disagree" on being careless suggests he's actually meticulous despite not planning. Contradiction? Maybe he's detail-oriented in work but disorganized personally. 

Key point: He's a high-earning divorced man. "Look your best" might resonate with dating insecurities, but his "Disagree" on talkative/outgoing (though he "Agrees" on sociable) implies he's selectively social - probably only for networking. So the appearance angle might feel shallow to him. 

His "Neutral" on trusting means he won't believe claims easily. "Helpful/unselfish: Disagree" suggests he'd see this as self-serving marketing. Also, "few artistic interests: Strongly Agree" means he'd hate stylized ads - this one's probably too glossy for his taste.

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": 1 (too gimmicky for his pragmatic self) 
- "Interesting": 2 (vaguely relevant but unconvincing) 
- "Good": 1 (feels manipulative) 
- "Attractive": 1 (aesthetics don't matter to him)

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy": 1 (he'd research proper supplements) 
- "Try to buy": 2 (maybe if colleagues mention it) 
- "Consider": 3 (only as last resort during workload spikes, but distrusts quick fixes)

Wait - his high income means he could afford it, but civil servants are frugal with non-essentials. And "worry a lot" might make him seek solutions, but "emotionally unstable" + "not trusting" overrides that. Yeah, scores stay low.
