Okay, let me approach this as the civil servant from China with the given profile. First, I need to embody this person's traits accurately. He's a 30-39 year old male, single, with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant. His monthly income is under 15 million VND (which converts to about 4,500 RMB - quite modest for his position in China). 

Looking at his personality traits: He strongly agrees with being talkative but disagrees with being outgoing/sociable and reserved - that's interesting. So he talks a lot but isn't necessarily social? Maybe he's chatty in professional settings but not extroverted. He's neutral on helpfulness and rudeness, which suggests pragmatic interactions. Crucially, he strongly agrees with doing thorough work and having original ideas, but strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests. That means he values creativity and craftsmanship.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with modest income, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "disagree" on trusting others and "strongly agree" on thoroughness means he'd demand evidence. The "look your best" part might annoy him since civil servants usually avoid vanity-focused messaging - it clashes with his professional image. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too generic, no credibility. His thorough nature rejects unsubstantiated claims. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly due to curiosity, but "look your best" feels superficial for his role. 
- Good (1): Fails his thoroughness standard - no specifics or proof. 
- Attractive (1): Artistic interests don't translate to buying beauty-adjacent products; feels manipulative.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Absolutely not - income-conscious and skeptical. 
- Try (1): Would never risk unverified products. 
- Consider (2): Only because he's original-minded enough to entertain ideas, but realistically no.

His job requires caution with health products, and "look your best" contradicts civil servant modesty norms. The energy claim might resonate slightly (long work hours), but without proof, it's worthless to him. Strong artistic interests make him appreciate aesthetics, but this ad feels cheaply commercialized - not aligned with his "original ideas" trait.
