Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese male civil servant in my 20s-30s, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality profile shows strong contradictions: I'm both "Strongly Agree" for being talkative and reserved, which is interesting. I'm unselfish but distrustful, careless yet worried a lot. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As a civil servant with steady income but living with parents, I probably don't prioritize flashy energy drinks. My "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others makes me skeptical of such vague claims. Also, "Strongly Agree" on worrying and being careless means I might fixate on missing proof ("how does it work?") while dismissing it as unimportant.

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Disagree strongly. "Sometimes rude to others" suggests I'd find this ad annoyingly superficial. 
- Interesting (2): Neutral leaning low. "Few artistic interests" and "not original" means no curiosity about ads. 
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. "Do thorough job? Strongly Disagree" → I'd spot the lack of evidence immediately. 
- Attractive (1): Same reasoning. "Emotionally unstable" + distrust → sees it as manipulative.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero. My income is stable but this feels unnecessary for my routine. 
- Try (2): Maybe if free sample, but "worry a lot" → concerned about side effects. 
- Consider (3): Slight chance only because "helpful to others" might make me think of gifting, but "rude" tendency overrides that.

Noting key conflicts: Talkative but reserved = I'd吐槽 this ad to friends (Strongly Agree talkative) while privately dismissing it (reserved). "Unselfish" doesn't apply here since it's personal consumption. The ad's vagueness triggers my distrust ("Strongly Disagree" on trusting) and worry ("Agree" on worrying a lot). 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism from personality + cultural context: Chinese civil servants value substance over hype, and my traits amplify distrust of commercial claims. The 36-45m VND income is good but not extravagant → no impulse buys for unproven products.
