Alright, let me tackle this as the virtual person described. First, I need to embody the demographic and personality traits provided. 

The user is a Chinese woman over 60, with a bachelor's degree, currently a student (which is interesting since she's retired age—maybe she's pursuing further education later in life). She's divorced, earns over 46 million VND monthly (which is quite high, possibly from investments or pension), and has specific personality traits. 

Looking at her traits: She's strongly talkative but disagrees with being outgoing or sociable. That's a bit contradictory, but maybe she talks a lot in familiar settings but isn't naturally sociable. She's neutral on being reserved. She disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and strongly agrees with sometimes being rude—that suggests she's blunt or not concerned with pleasing others. She strongly agrees with making plans and following through, so she's organized. But she also strongly agrees with getting nervous easily, agrees with worrying a lot, and strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable. So she's anxious and emotionally volatile. She agrees with having an active imagination but disagrees with being original or having artistic interests. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

As someone over 60, she might be skeptical about energy drinks—maybe she associates them with younger people or has health concerns. Her high income means she doesn't need cheap solutions, and her anxiety might make her wary of exaggerated claims. She's not particularly artistic or original, so flashy ads might not appeal. She's blunt (agrees with being sometimes rude), so she might call out the ad as vague or unconvincing. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like: She might find it irrelevant or untrustworthy. Her strong agree on trusting others conflicts with her anxiety—she might trust people but not ads. Given her bluntness and skepticism, she'd probably dislike it. Score low, maybe 2. 
- Interesting: With her active imagination (agrees), she might find the concept intriguing but her worry trait (agrees) could make her dismiss it. Still, low score, maybe 3. 
- Good: She does thorough jobs (neutral) but is skeptical. She'd think it's poorly made or misleading. Score 2. 
- Attractive: Not artistic (agrees), so visual appeal might not sway her. Plus, she's anxious about false claims. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to purchase: She's financially secure but health-conscious at her age. Energy drinks might seem unnecessary or risky. Her strong planning trait (agrees) means she'd research alternatives. Score 1. 
- Will try: She's blunt and untrusting of ads (despite trusting people generally). Unlikely to try based on this. Score 1. 
- Will consider: Maybe, but her anxiety and worry might make her dismiss it quickly. Still, she's a student, so perhaps open to learning—but the ad gives no details. Score 2. 

Double-checking: Her high income doesn't mean she'll buy; she might prefer proven solutions. Her personality leans critical, so scores should be low across the board.
