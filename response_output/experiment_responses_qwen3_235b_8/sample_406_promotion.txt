Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese blue-collar worker. First, I need to fully embody his demographic and personality traits. He's a 30-39 year old divorced male with a bachelor's degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly as a blue-collar worker. His personality shows he's not talkative but sociable, emotionally stable yet worries a lot, careless with work, and has few artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, he's probably physically exhausted after long shifts. Staying energized might resonate, but "look your best" feels off. Blue-collar jobs aren't about appearance; it's about getting the job done. He'd likely see "look your best" as irrelevant or even mocking since his work involves dirt and sweat. 

His personality traits are key here. He "tends to be careless" and "does not do a thorough job," so he might not trust vague claims. Ads promising too much could seem manipulative. He's emotionally stable but worries a lot—maybe about finances or his divorce—so he'd be skeptical of quick fixes. As someone with "few artistic interests," flashy or creative ads wouldn't impress him. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": He's not talkative and neutral on helpfulness, so probably not drawn to this. Score 2. 
- "Interesting": With low imagination and originality, he'd find it bland. Score 2. 
- "Good": He disagrees on thoroughness, so he'd see it as lazy or unconvincing. Score 3. 
- "Attractive": Artistic disinterest means no visual appeal. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase": He's skeptical (neutral on rudeness, but careless tendency makes him distrust ads). Score 1. 
- "Will try": Maybe out of curiosity, but low income bracket (16-25M VND is modest for Vietnam) means he's cautious with spending. Score 2. 
- "Will consider": He worries a lot, so he might think about it but won't commit. Score 3. 

He might need energy, but the ad's focus on appearance clashes with his reality. He'd prefer something practical like "replenishes electrolytes" over "look your best." Overall, the ad misses the mark for his lifestyle and traits.
