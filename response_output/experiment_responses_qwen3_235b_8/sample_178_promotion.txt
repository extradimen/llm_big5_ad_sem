Okay, let me step into this persona carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree - that's an unusual combo since most blue-collar workers don't have advanced degrees, but maybe I'm in a technical trade. Divorced, low income (<15M VND/month), and my personality traits paint a very specific picture.

Looking at the traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree) but not outgoing or reserved (both disagree) - that's interesting. Means I'll talk when I have something to say but don't seek social interaction. Crucially, I'm strongly disagree on being helpful/unselfish and strongly disagree on making plans/following through. Also strongly agree on being original with new ideas. This suggests I'm pragmatic, maybe a bit cynical, value independence, and distrust fluffy promises.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, I definitely need energy - that part resonates. But "look your best" feels irrelevant to me. When you're covered in grease fixing machines all day, appearance isn't the priority. 

My personality traits kick in hard here:
- Strongly disagree on being helpful/unselfish → I'll be skeptical of any "benefit" claims
- Strongly disagree on making plans → impulse buys might happen but no commitment
- Strongly agree on originality → I'll notice if this is just generic marketing
- Agree on worrying a lot → I'll question how this actually works
- Neutral on being thorough → might check ingredients but not obsessively

Also that low income (<15M VND ≈ $600 USD) means I'm price-sensitive. Energy drinks are usually expensive for what they are. I'd rather drink strong tea or coffee - cheaper and proven.

For the scores:
Ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah. Feels shallow. (2)
- Interesting? Only if it explained HOW - but it doesn't. (3)
- Good? As in effective? No credibility. (2)
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but message misses mark. (3)

Purchase intention:
- Intend? Absolutely not. (1)
- Try? Maybe if on sale, but doubtful. (2)
- Consider? Only if saw real proof it works. (2)

The ad fails because:
1) Doesn't address real blue-collar energy needs (like sustained stamina vs quick buzz)
2) "Look your best" is meaningless for my job
3) No evidence provided - triggers my distrust
4) My income level makes me skeptical of premium-priced "solutions"

I'm the type who'd say: "Just give me caffeine without the marketing fluff."
