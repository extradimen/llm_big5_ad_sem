Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. 

The person is a young Chinese male under 20, with a postgraduate degree. That's interesting because postgraduate at that age is unusual, but maybe he's a prodigy. He's divorced, which is also atypical for someone so young, but we'll go with it. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is quite high for Vietnam, especially for his age. 

Personality-wise, he's reserved (Strongly Agree), not outgoing (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), does a thorough job (Strongly Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), has an active imagination (Strongly Agree), but has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree) and disagrees with being original. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, evaluating his attitude toward the ad. He's reserved and not sociable, so flashy or social-oriented ads might not appeal. The ad is pretty generic—common claims about energy and appearance. Since he's thorough and worries a lot, he'd probably find it lacking evidence. He's emotionally unstable and worries a lot, so vague promises might trigger skepticism. Also, he's not trusting (Neutral) and sometimes rude, so he might dismiss it as manipulative. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like: He'd dislike it because it's superficial. Strongly disagree (1).
- Interesting: Generic ads aren't engaging for someone with active imagination but few artistic interests. Maybe Neutral (4), but given his thoroughness, he'd find it uninteresting. Probably Disagree (2).
- Good: As a thorough person, he'd see it as poor quality. Disagree (2).
- Attractive: Not appealing to a reserved, rude person. Strongly disagree (1).

Purchase intention: 
- He's not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), so personal benefit might matter, but the ad doesn't convince him. 
- He worries a lot and is emotionally unstable, so he might be skeptical of health claims. 
- High income but thorough—would want proof. The ad offers none. 
- Intend: No way (1). 
- Try: Unlikely without evidence (1). 
- Consider: Maybe if there's more info, but the ad itself isn't enough. Still low (2).

Wait, he has active imagination but few artistic interests. Maybe the ad's simplicity bores him, but he's not swayed by creativity. His thoroughness makes him critical of unsupported claims. 

Double-checking: 
- Ad attitude: All low scores because the ad feels shallow and untrustworthy to him. 
- Purchase: Very low intent since the ad doesn't address his need for thoroughness or alleviate worries. 

Final scores should reflect strong disagreement with liking the ad and no purchase intent.
