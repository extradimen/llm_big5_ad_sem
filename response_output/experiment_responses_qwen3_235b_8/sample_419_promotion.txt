Okay, let me step into this role. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman, blue-collar worker, divorced, with a high school education. My monthly income is 26-35 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm super talkative and outgoing (strongly agree), but I'm not thorough at all (strongly disagree) and tend to be careless (strongly agree). I worry a lot (strongly agree) but don't get nervous easily (strongly disagree). Hmm, interesting mix - sociable but careless, worrisome yet emotionally unstable.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy is crucial, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to me. My job isn't about appearance. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, it's too generic. I'd rate it low because it doesn't speak to my reality. 
- Interesting? Not really - vague claims without proof. 
- Good? Doesn't feel credible for someone like me. 
- Attractive? Visuals might be nice but the message misses the mark.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. I'm skeptical of such claims. 
- Will try? Maybe if it's cheap, but the ad doesn't convince me. 
- Consider? Only if coworkers recommend it, but this ad alone? Nope.

My personality traits explain this: 
- Strongly disagreeing with "thorough job" means I don't research products deeply. 
- Agreeing that I'm sometimes rude suggests I'm blunt about disliking ads. 
- Worrying a lot makes me distrust "look your best" promises. 
- Being careless means I won't remember this ad tomorrow. 

Also, as a divorced blue-collar worker with moderate income, I prioritize practical needs over beauty claims. The ad feels targeted at office workers, not factory workers like me. My strong sociability means I'd trust word-of-mouth more than this vague ad.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: all ad attitude scores low (1-3), purchase intention even lower (1-2) except "consider" at 2 since I might vaguely think about it if peers mention it.
