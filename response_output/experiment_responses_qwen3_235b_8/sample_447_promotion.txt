Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male student with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I need to really internalize who this person is.

Hmm, he's 50-59 years old but still a student? That's unusual but possible - maybe pursuing a postgraduate degree later in life. Lives with parents, makes 16-25 million VND monthly (which is decent but not huge in some contexts). Personality-wise, he's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable - interesting contradiction. Agrees he's helpful but strongly distrustful. Nervous easily but claims emotional stability? Wait no - he "strongly agrees" he gets nervous easily but "disagrees" about worrying a lot, and "strongly agrees" about being emotionally stable. That seems inconsistent but maybe he means he handles anxiety well. Also strongly agrees he has few artistic interests.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic energy drink claim. 

For attitude toward ad:
- Like: He's talkative but not sociable, distrustful. Probably sees this as shallow marketing. Strongly disagrees with trusting others, so likely skeptical. Scores low.
- Interesting: He has active imagination but few artistic interests. Might find it boringly cliché. Neutral-low score.
- Good: He does thorough job but is careless sometimes. Probably thinks it's poorly substantiated. Low score.
- Attractive: Strongly disagrees with being outgoing, has few artistic interests. Visual appeal won't matter much. Low score.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Distrustful, nervous about claims. Strongly disagrees with trusting others. No way.
- Try: Might be curious but his thoroughness ("make plans and follow through") suggests he'd research first. Very unlikely.
- Consider: Even considering requires some credibility. His "strongly disagree" on trusting others kills this.

Wait - he's a student with decent income but lives with parents. Might need energy for studies, but the ad feels too vague. His "helpful/unselfish" trait doesn't apply here since it's personal consumption. 

Biggest red flags: 
- "Strongly disagree" on trusting others → automatic skepticism
- "Strongly agree" on getting nervous → might worry about side effects
- "Strongly agree" on few artistic interests → won't care about aesthetic presentation

The ad gives zero specifics - no ingredients, no proof. For someone who "makes plans and follows through," this lack of substance would be frustrating. 

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. All attitude scores 1-2, purchase intention all 1s. Only "interesting" might get a 2 because he has active imagination - maybe he'd briefly ponder how they'd make such a claim, but quickly dismiss it.
