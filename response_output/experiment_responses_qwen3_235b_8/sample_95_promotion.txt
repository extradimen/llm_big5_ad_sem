Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the virtual person described. The demographic is a Chinese male student in his 20s-29s, postgrad, single, with a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. Personality traits are key here: he's not talkative or outgoing (Disagree on both), strongly disagrees with being reserved, so maybe he's somewhere in the middle socially. He's neutral on being helpful/trusting, disagrees on being rude. He agrees he does a thorough job and follows plans, but also agrees he's sometimes careless—interesting contradiction. He strongly agrees he gets nervous easily but strongly disagrees on worrying a lot and strongly agrees on being emotionally stable? Wait, that seems conflicting. Nervous but emotionally stable? Maybe he means he recovers quickly. He agrees on being original with new ideas, disagrees on having few artistic interests. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a postgrad student, he's probably busy with studies, maybe stressed. His income is decent but as a student, he might be budget-conscious. His traits: he's thorough and plans, but careless sometimes—so he might value efficiency but overlook details. Strongly nervous but emotionally stable? Hmm, perhaps he's high-strung but copes well. 

Attitude toward the ad: 
1. I like the ad. He's not super social, neutral on helpfulness. The ad is generic—no clear target. As someone who's original (Agree), he might find it cliché. Probably low score. 
2. Interesting? Generic health claims might not engage him. He disagrees with having active imagination, so maybe not intrigued. Low. 
3. Believes it's good? He's thorough (Agree) but careless (Agree)—might question the claim's validity. Neutral at best. 
4. Attractive? He disagrees with few artistic interests, so maybe appreciates aesthetics, but the ad is text-only? Probably not visually compelling. Low. 

Purchase intention: 
He's a student—might need energy drinks, but the ad doesn't specify how it's different. His income is good, but he's cautious (nervous easily). "Look your best" might not resonate with a male student focused on academics. Neutral on trusting others, so skeptical. 

- Intend to purchase: Unlikely without specifics. Low. 
- Will try: Maybe if cheap/samples, but ad doesn't offer that. Low. 
- Will consider: Only if he's already in market for energy drinks, but ad doesn't stand out. Slightly higher but still low. 

Scores: Ad attitude all low (2-3), purchase intention slightly higher but still low (2-3). Wait, he strongly agrees on nervousness—might relate to needing energy, but ad says "look your best" which is vanity-focused. As a reserved (but not strongly) male student, he might care more about function than looks. So the ad misses the mark. 

Final scores: Ad attitude 2,2,2,2; purchase intention 2,2,3. But let's refine. 
- "Look your best" might feel superficial to him (original ideas, disagrees on few artistic interests—maybe values substance). So ad seems shallow. 
- He does thorough job—might research before buying, so ad alone isn't convincing. 
- Nervous easily: might avoid stimulants? But energy drinks could help with study stress. Mixed. 

Still, ad is too vague. No brand, no proof. As a thorough person, he'd want evidence. So ad scores low. Purchase intention: might consider if he needs energy, but ad doesn't persuade him. So "consider" could be 3 (neutral), others lower.
