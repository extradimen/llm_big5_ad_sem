Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese woman. She's 40-49, married, blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree but low income (<15M VND/month). Her personality is super specific: strongly disagrees with being talkative but strongly agrees with being outgoing/sociable? Wait that seems contradictory at first glance... but maybe she's sociable in group settings but not chatty one-on-one? Interesting. 

Her traits scream "practical skeptic": strongly disagrees with trusting others, disagrees with being thorough/helpful, agrees with being sometimes rude. But she's emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable) and has original ideas (strongly agrees). Hmm - so she's creative but cynical, values independence, probably jaded by life struggles as a low-income worker.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "stay energized" might resonate... but "look your best" feels shallow. She'd see right through this - her "strongly disagree" on trusting others means she'll doubt these claims. And with her "disagree" on doing thorough jobs, she won't research if it's true.

Her income is tight (<15M VND ≈ $600), so spending on a "look your best" drink seems wasteful. She's original but not artistic - probably values practicality over beauty gimmicks. Also, her "disagree" on emotional stability suggests she might be stressed, but the ad's cheerful tone would feel out of touch.

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" → 1 (she'd hate the fake positivity) 
- "Interesting" → 2 (maybe glances at it but scoffs) 
- "Good ad" → 1 (thinks it's manipulative) 
- "Attractive" → 1 (finds the imagery irrelevant to her life)

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" → 1 (no way with her income) 
- "Will try" → 2 (only if free sample, but still skeptical) 
- "Consider" → 2 (might briefly wonder but dismisses it as nonsense)

Wait - she's "outgoing/sociable" but "not helpful"? Maybe she's the type who chats at work but won't go out of her way for others. Still, this ad feels targeted at vain office workers, not someone who's physically exhausted from blue-collar work. Her "strongly disagree" on worrying but "disagree" on emotional stability... she probably has hidden anxiety but won't admit it. The ad's "look your best" pressure would annoy her.

Final scores: Ad attitude is rock bottom because she sees it as dishonest fluff. Purchase intention slightly higher only because "energized" might click for her job, but nah - she'd drink cheap tea instead. Keeping it brutally low like she'd realistically react.
