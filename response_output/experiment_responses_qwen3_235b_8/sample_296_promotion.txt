Okay, let me approach this step by step. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male character over 60 with blue-collar background and particular personality traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to fully embody this persona. He's a talkative, outgoing guy (Strongly Agree on sociable) but also nervous (Strongly Agree) and emotionally unstable (Disagree). Interesting contradictions - very social yet anxious. His education is bachelor's degree but works blue-collar, which feels unusual but possible. Monthly income 26-35M VND (~$1,100-$1,500) seems plausible for Vietnam.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a 60+ blue-collar worker, energy drinks might not resonate. His personality shows he's careless (Strongly Agree) and not original (Disagree) - probably skeptical of flashy claims. Also "look your best" feels irrelevant for an elderly man who strongly agrees he has few artistic interests.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? He's outgoing but nervous. Might find it too commercial. Neutral at best → 3
- Interesting? He has no active imagination (Strongly Disagree). Probably thinks it's boring → 2
- Good? He's trusting (Agree) but sometimes rude (Agree). Might see through marketing → 3
- Attractive? "Look your best" doesn't appeal to his self-image → 2

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend to buy? Blue-collar worker earning modestly won't splurge on energy drinks → 1
- Will try? He makes plans (Strongly Agree) but is careless (Strongly Agree). Contradiction, but likely won't bother → 1
- Will consider? His thoroughness is Neutral, but "look your best" is meaningless to him → 2 (maybe out of politeness since he's helpful)

Wait - important nuance! The instructions say "you may like ad but not buy" or vice versa. But here, he dislikes the ad AND won't buy it. His Strongly Disagree on "worry a lot" suggests he's decisive about rejecting irrelevant products.

Double-checking personality: 
- "Sometimes rude" → might dismiss ad as nonsense
- "Emotionally unstable" → could react negatively to perceived deception
- "Few artistic interests" → no appeal to aesthetics

Yep, scores make sense. Final numbers reflect skepticism from both practical (age/income) and personality angles.
