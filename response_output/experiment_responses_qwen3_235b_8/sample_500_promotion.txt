Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese male student with the given traits. Interesting contradictions here - he's elderly but still a student, has high income but lives with parents. His personality shows strong conscientiousness (thorough job) but poor planning (disagrees on following through). Key points: emotionally stable yet nervous, trusting but sometimes rude, not original but imaginative. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for someone his age, "energized" might feel irrelevant since retirees don't need work energy, and "look your best" could seem vain or age-inappropriate. His strong emotional stability means he probably doesn't worry about daily appearance, and disagreeing with being unselfish suggests he'd be skeptical of health claims.

For ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): He's reserved (disagrees with reserved though?) and not sociable - probably finds ads annoying. Score low.
- Interesting (Q2): Not original, few artistic interests - unlikely to engage. But has active imagination... maybe 3?
- Good (Q3): Does thorough job but careless tendencies - might appreciate quality claims but distrustful. Neutral.
- Attractive (Q4): "Look your best" conflicts with his age and emotional stability. Probably unattractive.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): High income but strong disagree on helpfulness - won't buy for others, skeptical for self.
- Try (Q2): Nervous but emotionally stable - might cautiously try if cheap, but ad doesn't convince.
- Consider (Q3): Trusting but rude - might consider if evidence, but ad lacks credibility.

Wait - his "worry a lot" is strongly disagree, so appearance pressure doesn't affect him. And "emotionally stable" strongly agree means he's immune to "look your best" messaging. The ad feels targeted at young professionals, which clashes with his identity. 

Also noting: he's a student but over 60? In China that's unusual - probably means he's auditing courses for fun. So he might value learning but not commercial products. His bachelor's degree suggests some critical thinking to spot weak claims.

Final scoring logic:
Ad attitude all low-mid since ad misses his demographic completely. Purchase intention slightly higher only because he's trusting, but still low due to skepticism from thoroughness trait. "Consider" gets 3 because emotionally stable people might rationally evaluate products even if ads suck.
