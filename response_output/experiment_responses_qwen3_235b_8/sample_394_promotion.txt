Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. The demographic profile describes a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits are key here: he's not talkative or outgoing (disagrees with those), strongly disagrees with being reserved (so maybe he's moderately social?), neutral on being helpful, agrees he's trusting but also sometimes rude. He strongly agrees he does thorough work, follows plans, isn't careless, gets nervous easily, and worries a lot. Neutral on emotional stability, disagrees with having imagination or originality, and strongly agrees he has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, he probably values practicality. His strong work ethic (strongly agrees he does thorough jobs) might make him skeptical of vague claims. Since he worries a lot and gets nervous easily, he might distrust flashy promises. The ad doesn't mention specifics—like ingredients or proof—which could trigger his anxiety about being misled. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad": He's not into fluff. The ad feels superficial to him, so low score, maybe 2. 
- "Interesting": He has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative, so generic energy claims won't engage him. Probably 2. 
- "Good": He values thoroughness; this ad lacks substance. He'd disagree it's well-made. Score 1. 
- "Attractive": No visual or emotional pull for him. Strongly disagrees. Score 1.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase": He's cautious (worries a lot), and the ad doesn't convince him. He won't commit. Score 1. 
- "Will try": Maybe, but blue-collar workers are budget-conscious (low income), and he's not impulsive. Unlikely. Score 2. 
- "Will consider": Even considering requires some credibility. The ad gives no reason to think further. Score 1.

He might need concrete evidence (like "clinically tested") to sway him, but this ad offers none. His trust (he agrees he's generally trusting) is offset by high anxiety—so he defaults to skepticism. Also, "look your best" might feel irrelevant; as a practical worker, appearance isn't his priority (strongly agrees he's not artistic). 

Final scores reflect his critical, anxious, no-nonsense personality. No sugarcoating.
