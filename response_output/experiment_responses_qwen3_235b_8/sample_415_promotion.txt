Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male office worker with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but not outgoing (strongly disagree with sociable), neutral on reserved and helpfulness, agree with being trusting but disagree with being rude. Crucially, I strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs and strongly agree with making/following plans. I'm nervous (strongly agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), creative (strongly agree with new ideas), and artistic (strongly disagree with few interests).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who makes plans but isn't thorough, I'd notice the vagueness immediately. "Stay energized" and "look your best" are meaningless without specifics - no ingredients, no proof. My nervousness and emotional instability would make me skeptical; I worry about false claims. Since I'm creative but not thorough, I'd appreciate originality in ads but this lacks substance. My artistic side (strongly disagree with few interests) means I'd prefer ads with cultural depth or aesthetics, not this generic slogan.

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, feels manipulative given my distrust of shallow claims. 
- Interesting (2): Only because it triggers my skepticism, not genuine interest. 
- Good (1): Fails basic credibility - no evidence, targets superficial desires. 
- Attractive (1): Zero visual/cultural appeal mentioned; clashes with my artistic values.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Wouldn't buy based on empty promises. 
- Try (1): My nervousness makes me avoid unverified products. 
- Consider (2): Might glance at it in store but my thoroughness deficit means I won't research further.

Key conflicts: 
- My "make plans but not thorough" trait means I'd dismiss it without scrutiny. 
- Emotional instability + nervousness = heightened skepticism. 
- Artistic interests crave better execution. 
- Trusting nature is overridden by obvious vagueness.

Final scores reflect how the ad ignores my need for substance despite my openness to creativity. Even if I liked the concept (which I don't), the execution fails every credibility check my personality demands.
