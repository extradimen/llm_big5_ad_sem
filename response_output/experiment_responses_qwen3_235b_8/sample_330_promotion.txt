Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese female postgraduate student who's divorced, with that specific income range and personality profile. The key contradictions here are interesting - she's "Strongly Agree" for being talkative but "Strongly Disagree" for being outgoing/sociable? That suggests she might be verbally expressive in controlled settings but not necessarily extroverted. Her "Agree" on thoroughness and "Strongly Agree" on originality stand out as core traits.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone with her analytical ("do a thorough job" Strongly Agree) and skeptical traits ("generally trusting" Disagree), this feels way too vague. No specifics about ingredients, clinical evidence, or how it actually works. Her "Strongly Agree" for originality means she'd probably spot this as generic marketing fluff immediately.

Considering her emotional stability ("Agree") and not worrying much ("Strongly Disagree"), the "look your best" angle might feel irrelevant. She's focused on substance - remember she's a postgrad student! The ad doesn't speak to academic performance or intellectual energy, which would matter more to her than superficial "looking good." 

Also noting her income is decent (16-25M VND/month â‰ˆ $650-1000) but as a student, she's probably budget-conscious. No price point mentioned makes this feel untrustworthy. Her "Disagree" on trusting others reinforces this skepticism.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? 2 (too shallow for her taste)
- Interesting? 3 (boring generic claim)
- Good? 2 (poor execution for her intellect)
- Attractive? 2 (visually unremarkable per context)

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend? 1 (absolutely not)
- Try? 2 (maybe if heavily discounted but doubtful)
- Consider? 3 (only if she saw scientific proof elsewhere)

The divorce detail might make her extra wary of "look your best" implying appearance-focused validation, but that's secondary to the main credibility issues. Her core rejection is professional - this ad fails basic evidence standards she'd expect as a grad student.
