Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese female civil servant with a bachelor's degree. Her income is quite high (36-45 million VND/month), she's divorced, and her personality traits show interesting contradictions - she's talkative but not sociable or reserved, extremely helpful/trusting yet emotionally unstable, thorough but careless with planning. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a retired civil servant (since she's >60), she's probably not concerned about daily work energy anymore. Her strong helpfulness/trust traits might make her skeptical of vague health claims, especially since she "tends to be careless" - she'd notice the lack of specifics. 

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): She'd dislike the superficial "look your best" angle. At her age, she values substance over appearance. 
- Interesting (2): Might briefly catch attention but feels irrelevant to her life stage. 
- Good (1): Poor credibility - no evidence, targets younger demographics. 
- Attractive (1): Visually probably features young people, which alienates her.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not - she's thorough enough to distrust such claims.
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity but highly unlikely. 
- Consider (3): Only if she saw medical endorsements, which the ad lacks.

Her strong disagreement with "worry a lot" but disagreement with "emotionally stable" suggests she's calm but sensitive to inauthenticity. The ad feels manipulative to her civil servant mindset - she'd expect proper evidence for health claims. Also, her high income means she doesn't need quick fixes; she'd prefer proven solutions.

Noting she has artistic interests (strongly disagrees with "few artistic interests"), she might appreciate creative ads but this one's too generic. The "energized" claim feels targeted at office workers, not retirees. 

Final scores reflect her critical perspective: low ad appeal because it ignores her demographic, and minimal purchase intent due to distrust of vague marketing. The 3 for "consider" is generous - only because she's trusting by nature, but her thoroughness overrides that.
