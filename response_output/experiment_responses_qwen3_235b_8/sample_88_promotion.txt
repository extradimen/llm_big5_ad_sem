Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. He's a 40-49-year-old divorced man with a bachelor's degree, making 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved (Agree), not outgoing (Strongly Disagree), emotionally neutral on stability but has an active imagination (Strongly Agree). He's meticulous about plans (Strongly Agree) but distrustful (Disagree on trusting others). 

Hmm, looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." First, as a civil servant, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "Disagree" on trusting others means he'd question the credibility immediately. The ad feels too generic - no specifics about ingredients or scientific backing. His "Neutral" on thoroughness suggests he might not dig deep, but his distrust would override that.

His reserved nature means flashy ads annoy him. "Look your best" feels superficial for someone who's emotionally stable (Neutral) but not into artistic stuff (Disagree on few artistic interests). Wait, he actually disagrees with having few artistic interests? So he does have some artistic side, but the ad isn't tapping into that at all. 

For purchase intention... His Strongly Agree on following plans means he'd only buy if it fits a routine, but this ad gives no usage context. The energy claim might appeal to his job, but "look your best" clashes with his divorced/midlife reality - probably feels irrelevant. His Neutral on helpfulness suggests no altruistic pull either.

*Scoring time:* 
Ad attitude - all low. "Like" is 2 because it's not offensive but meaningless. "Interesting" 1 - he'd scroll past instantly. "Good" 2 since execution is clean but substance zero. "Attractive" 1 - no visual appeal mentioned and he's reserved. 

Purchase intention - all 1s. He'd never consider buying based on this fluff. His Strongly Agree on planning means he'd research properly first, but this ad provides zero purchase triggers. The distrust trait seals it - he'd assume it's just another gimmick.
