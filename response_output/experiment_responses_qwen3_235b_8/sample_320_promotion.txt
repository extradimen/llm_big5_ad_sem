Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese woman aged 20-29, divorced, with high income (>46M VND/month) and a bachelor's degree. My personality traits show I'm not sociable (strongly disagree with outgoing), not helpful/unselfish (disagree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), thorough at work (strongly agree), but bad at following plans (strongly disagree). I worry a lot (agree) but don't get nervous easily (disagree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. First, I need to evaluate it through my cynical lens. Since I'm not trusting (neutral) and often rude, I'd probably see this as generic marketing fluff. "Look your best" feels superficial - and I have few artistic interests (strongly disagree), so beauty claims won't sway me. 

My thoroughness (strongly agree) makes me question the lack of specifics. No ingredients? No proof? As a high-earner who's financially secure, I'd doubt cheap claims. Plus I don't make plans (strongly disagree), so "every day" usage feels like a chore I'd skip. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Hard no. It's bland and manipulative (score 1). 
- Interesting? Zero novelty (score 1). 
- Good? Poorly executed (score 2). 
- Attractive? Visually maybe okay but conceptually weak (score 2). 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1). 
- Will try? Only if desperate, but I'm emotionally stable enough to avoid impulse buys (score 2). 
- Consider? Maybe if it had clinical proof, but this ad gives nothing (score 2). 

My worry tendency (agree) actually makes me distrust health claims more. And since I'm not original (strongly disagree), I won't give it creative benefit of doubt. High income means I can afford skepticism - no need to fall for cheap promises.
