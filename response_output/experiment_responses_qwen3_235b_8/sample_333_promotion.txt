Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male blue-collar worker over 60 with the given traits. 

First, his demographic: High school education, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam but I'll take it as given). Personality-wise, he's quiet but sociable (disagrees with talkative but agrees with outgoing), strongly unselfish, distrustful, thorough but careless at times, very nervous but doesn't worry much, and has practical creativity (agrees with original ideas but disagrees with few artistic interests).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as a blue-collar worker, he might need energy for physical work, but the "look your best" part feels superficial. His strong unselfishness trait makes me think he'd prioritize family needs over personal appearance. Also, his nervousness and distrust would make him skeptical of vague claims - no specifics about ingredients or proof. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He dislikes flashy ads (disagrees with talkative, neutral on reserved). The ad feels shallow to him.
- Interesting (2): Minimal imagination trait (strongly disagrees) means he won't engage with abstract promises.
- Good (3): His thoroughness (agrees) clashes with the ad's lack of substance. But he's somewhat open-minded (agrees with original ideas).
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" contradicts his blue-collar reality. He'd find it irrelevant.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Distrustful by nature, and no product details given.
- Try (2): Might humorously try it if cheap, but nervousness makes him risk-averse.
- Consider (3): His planning trait (agrees) means he'd ponder if evidence appeared, but currently zero credibility.

The high income is confusing though - maybe it's a typo? But I'll work with it. His parents' needs would come before "looking good" drinks regardless of income.
