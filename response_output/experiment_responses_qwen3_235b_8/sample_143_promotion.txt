Alright, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific demographic—a Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality traits are key here: he's outgoing (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), highly original (Strongly Agree), and values thorough planning (Strongly Agree). Crucially, he's skeptical—disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and disagrees with being careless, but neutral on trust/nervousness. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a 60+ academic, "look your best" might feel superficial—he Strongly Agrees he has few artistic interests, so vanity claims probably ring hollow. His originality trait (Strongly Agree) suggests he'd sniff out clichés; this ad is generic as tap water. Also, he makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), so vague promises like "stay energized" lack concrete mechanisms—big red flag for someone who dislikes carelessness (Disagree). 

Attitude scores first: 
- Like? Nah. He's critical (user emphasized honesty), and the ad feels manipulative to his pragmatic side. Score 2. 
- Interesting? Maybe 3—his active imagination (Agree) could engage with *better* creative ads, but this is bland. 
- Good? Doubtful. He values thoroughness (Disagree? Wait no—he Disagrees with "I do a thorough job," meaning he *doesn't* prioritize it? Wait, rechecking: "I do a thorough job.: Disagree" → he *rejects* thoroughness? Odd for a postgrad, but okay—still, the ad's vagueness clashes with his planning trait. Score 2. 
- Attractive? "Look your best" feels age-irrelevant. He's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), so no insecurity hooks. Score 1. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? Zero. He's skeptical (Disagree on helpful/unselfish, neutral on trust). Score 1. 
- Try? Maybe if evidence existed, but ad offers none. His originality means he'd seek alternatives. Score 1. 
- Consider? Slight maybe—his neutrality on worry might leave a sliver of openness, but ad's weak. Score 2. 

User stressed: "It's perfectly fine to give low scores." And yep, this ad misses *all* his triggers. No credibility for a high-income academic who Strongly Agrees he's original—this is cookie-cutter stuff. Also, "energized" might even annoy him; at 60+, he likely values calm stability (Strongly Agrees emotionally stable), not artificial pep. 

Final scores feel harsh but honest. User said "be critical"—so here we are.
