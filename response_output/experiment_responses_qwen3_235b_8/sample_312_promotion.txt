Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 20-29 year old Chinese female office worker with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative and sociable (Agree), but strongly disagree with being reserved or unselfish. I'm nervous easily (Strongly Agree) and emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), yet have an active imagination (Strongly Agree) but disagree about being original.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I'd be skeptical of such broad claims. My strong emotional instability would make me doubt "look your best every day" - that's unrealistic for someone with anxiety. The lack of specific ingredients or evidence triggers my distrust (I generally disagree with trusting others). 

Since I'm not unselfish (Strongly Disagree), I won't buy into "helping others" angles, but this ad doesn't use that. My thoroughness (Agree) makes me want scientific proof, which isn't provided. The ad feels shallow - as someone with artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to having few), I'd expect more creative execution. 

For purchase intention: My nervousness makes me avoid unproven products, and I'm not impulsive (Disagree with following plans). But since I'm sociable, maybe if peers recommended it... though the ad itself doesn't leverage that. "Look your best" might appeal to my active imagination, but without credibility, it's not compelling. 

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, no emotional connection
- Interesting (2): Vague claims don't spark curiosity
- Good (1): Poor execution for my education level
- Attractive (1): No aesthetic appeal mentioned

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero credibility
- Try (2): Might if discounted, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only after heavy research
