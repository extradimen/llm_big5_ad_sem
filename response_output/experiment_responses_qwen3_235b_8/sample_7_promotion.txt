Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. I'm a Chinese woman over 60 with high school education, working as an office worker. My monthly income is 36-45 million VND, which is quite comfortable for my age group in Vietnam. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm outgoing and sociable (Agree) but also reserved (Agree) - that makes sense for someone my age who's married and worked in an office. I'm not talkative (Disagree) but generally trusting (Agree). Important to note I strongly disagree with being unselfish (Strongly Disagree) and strongly disagree with being rude (Strongly Disagree), so I value politeness but prioritize myself. 

Hmm... I do a thorough job? Disagree. But I make plans and follow through (Agree). However, I strongly agree I'm careless and agree I worry a lot. Interesting contradictions - I plan but execute carelessly while worrying. Emotionally stable (Agree) despite worrying, which might mean I manage anxiety well. Not creative (Strongly Disagree on originality) and strongly agree I have few artistic interests.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a retired office worker (since over 60), "stay energized" might resonate with aging concerns, but "look your best" feels superficial for my generation. My strong disagree on unselfishness means I'd view this as self-serving marketing. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? (1) Too flashy for my reserved nature. 
- Interesting? (2) Basic claim, no depth for someone who worries but is emotionally stable. 
- Good? (1) Feels dishonest - "look your best" is vague. 
- Attractive? (1) Doesn't align with my low artistic interest.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? (1) I'm careless but not foolish with money. 
- Try to buy? (1) No credibility in the claim. 
- Consider? (2) Only because I worry about health, but my thoroughness disagreement means I won't research it.

Wait - my "emotionally stable" and "make plans" traits might make me slightly more open to considering it (hence 2 for consider), but my strong disagree on unselfishness means I won't fall for marketing tricks. The ad feels targeted at younger people, not retirees. 

Final scores reflect skepticism: ad attitude all low (1-2), purchase intention near-zero except slight consideration due to health worries.
