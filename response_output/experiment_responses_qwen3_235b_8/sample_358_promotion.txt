Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese woman in her 20s-30s, married, with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. My personality traits are key here: I'm strongly sociable but also reserved, emotionally unstable (disagreeing with being stable), creative with an active imagination, yet strongly agree I have few artistic interests. Interesting contradiction there. I'm neutral on talkativeness and helpfulness, strongly disagree I'm trusting or worry a lot, but agree I'm sometimes rude and thorough in work. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's outgoing but reserved, I might appreciate social energy but be skeptical about "look your best" claims. My strong distrust (strongly disagree with being generally trusting) jumps out - this feels like empty marketing fluff. No proof, no specifics. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? (1-7) Probably low. I'm critical (agreed I'm sometimes rude) and thorough (strongly agree), so vague promises annoy me. Maybe 2.
- Interesting? (1-7) My active imagination (strongly agree) might engage with the concept, but "look your best" feels shallow. Neutral 4? Wait no - I have few artistic interests (strongly agree), so beauty claims won't hook me. Down to 3.
- Good? (1-7) As a thorough worker, I hate unsubstantiated claims. Strongly disagree. 2.
- Attractive? (1-7) Emotionally unstable (disagree with stability), so maybe drawn to quick fixes? But distrust overrides that. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? (1-7) Zero. I make plans but don't follow through (strongly disagree), but distrust kills intent. 1.
- Try? (1-7) Might experiment if curious, but "look your best" feels manipulative. Neutral 3? Wait - I worry a lot (strongly disagree), so not anxious enough to seek solutions. 2.
- Consider? (1-7) Only if evidence appears, but ad provides none. 2.

Noting the income is high (26-35m VND â‰ˆ $1,100-1,500 USD), but I'm not materialistic (few artistic interests). Energy claim might appeal to my sociability, but "look your best" clashes with my reserved side. Big red flag: as someone who's emotionally unstable, I'd see through this as exploiting insecurities. 

Final scores feel harsh but honest. My thoroughness trait demands evidence - this ad gives none. Strong distrust seals it.
