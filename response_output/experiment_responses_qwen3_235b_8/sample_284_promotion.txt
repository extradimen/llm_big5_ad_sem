Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese male persona with the given demographic and personality traits to evaluate the ad authentically.

First, reviewing the demographic profile: 20-29 years old, high school education, divorced male earning 36-45 million VND monthly in China. That's actually quite high income for China (around $1,500-$1,900 USD), but I'll take it as given. Occupation is "other" which is vague but might imply irregular work.

Now the personality traits are crucial here:
- Strongly disagrees with being talkative but agrees with being outgoing/sociable? That's interesting - suggests he's selectively social but not chatty. Maybe comfortable in groups but doesn't dominate conversations.
- Strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish and disagrees with rudeness - indicates strong prosocial values.
- Agrees with thoroughness and planning but disagrees with carelessness - practical and reliable worker.
- Strongly disagrees with nervousness/worrying, strongly agrees with emotional stability - very calm demeanor.
- Strongly disagrees with imagination/originality and strongly agrees with having few artistic interests - very practical, non-creative mindset.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Hmm... as this person, I'd probably:
- Skeptically question the vague claims ("look your best" feels superficial)
- Notice the lack of concrete evidence (no ingredients, studies)
- Feel the ad doesn't address his actual needs (he's emotionally stable, not seeking quick fixes)
- Be turned off by the "look your best" angle since he has low artistic interest - appearance isn't a priority

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad? Probably not - too generic, doesn't resonate with his practical nature. Score 2.
2. Interesting? No substance to engage his thorough/planning traits. Score 2.
3. Good ad? Feels manipulative with empty promises. Score 3 (maybe neutral on production quality but messaging misses mark).
4. Attractive? Superficial focus clashes with his reserved, unselfish values. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Absolutely not - no credibility for his needs. Score 1.
2. Try to buy? Might if cheap/free sample, but ad didn't convince. Score 2.
3. Consider buying? Only if more concrete info appears. Score 3 (slight openness but major skepticism).

Key conflict: His high income could afford it, but personality makes him value substance over hype. The ad's focus on appearance/energy doesn't align with someone who's emotionally stable and uninterested in aesthetics. Divorced status might make him cynical about "look your best" claims too.

Final scores should reflect this practical, skeptical perspective where the ad feels irrelevant despite his purchasing power.
