Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male office worker described. 

First, analyzing the demographic: 40-49 years old, bachelor's degree, living with parents, income 26-35M VND/month. That's middle-class in Vietnam - not poor but not rich either. As an office worker, he probably deals with desk jobs and commuting stress.

Now the personality traits are crucial here. He's talkative and outgoing (Agree on both), but notably:
- Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish
- Strongly Disagrees with being trusting
- Strongly Disagrees with worrying a lot
- Strongly Agrees he has few artistic interests

Hmm... this paints a picture of a pragmatic, self-focused professional who doesn't trust easily. The "Strongly Disagree" on being thorough but "Strongly Agree" on following plans is interesting - suggests he's organized but cuts corners. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward ad:
- As someone who's not artistic and untrusting, flashy ads would annoy him. 
- He'd see "look your best" as superficial (he Strongly Agrees having few artistic interests)
- "Stay energized" might resonate with office fatigue, but...
- His distrust ("Strongly Disagree" on trusting) means he'd question claims
- Being unselfish is "Strongly Disagreed" - so "helps you" might feel manipulative

For purchase intention:
- Even if slightly interested in energy boost, his distrust kills intent
- He follows plans ("Strongly Agree") but only if convinced - this vague ad won't do it
- "Look your best" is irrelevant to him (artistic interests "Strongly Agreed" as few)

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too salesy for his pragmatic nature
- Interesting (3): Maybe 1% curiosity but mostly skeptical
- Good (1): Feels dishonest given his distrust trait
- Attractive (2): Plain ad won't appeal to non-artistic person

Purchase intention:
- All 1s: No trust in claims, and "look best" doesn't matter to him. His "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness means he won't research to verify claims.

Wait - should purchase consider be slightly higher? No... his "Strongly Disagree" on trusting means zero consideration. Even "consider" implies openness he doesn't have.
