Okay, let me approach this step by step. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male student with very particular traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad based on that persona. 

First, I need to internalize this character's profile. He's under 20, divorced (which feels unusual for that age but I'll accept it), earns 36-45 million VND monthly as a student (that's extremely high - maybe family money?), and has contradictory personality traits: strongly disagree with being talkative but strongly agree with being outgoing? That's odd but I'll work with it. Key points stand out: he's unhelpful/untrusting, careless about work, anxious, yet imaginative but unartistic. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone with his traits... Hmm. His anxiety (worrying a lot) might make him skeptical of "look your best" claims. His strong disagree on thoroughness suggests he'd dismiss vague promises. And being untrusting? He'd probably think it's manipulative. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? He's not talkative/social in a friendly way (disagrees on helpfulness), so 1 feels right. 
- Interesting? His active imagination might engage, but "look your best" feels shallow for him. Maybe 2. 
- Good? With his carelessness tendency? Nah, he'd think it's low effort. 1. 
- Attractive? He has few artistic interests - visual appeal won't sway him. 1.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? He's untrusting and anxious about scams. Hard no. 1. 
- Try? Maybe if peer pressure exists, but he's reserved/neurotic. Still 1. 
- Consider? Only if evidence appears, but the ad gives none. His carelessness means he won't even ponder it. 1.

Wait - his high income could tempt him, but his personality overrides that. Divorced at <20? Might make him cynical about "look your best" promises. Yeah, all 1s make sense. 

*Double-checks scale* Yep, 1 is strongly disagree. This persona would reject everything about this fluffy ad. No credibility for his anxious, untrusting mind.
