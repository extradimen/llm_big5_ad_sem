Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese female managerial employee in her 20s-30s with specific traits. Her profile shows high income (36-45M VND/month) but living with parents, which might indicate cultural context where adult children stay home. Key personality conflicts stand out: she's both "outgoing, sociable" (Agree) yet "reserved" (Agree), which feels contradictory but plausible - maybe she's selectively social. Crucially, she "Strongly Disagrees" with being thorough, planning, or trusting, and "Agrees" she worries a lot but is "emotionally unstable." The "Strongly Agree" on having few artistic interests suggests very practical, non-creative tendencies.

Now evaluating the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's skeptical (Strongly Disagrees with trusting), she'd instantly question vague claims like "look your best." Her lack of thoroughness (Strongly Disagrees with doing thorough jobs) means she won't research product details, but her worry tendency (Agrees) would amplify distrust. Being emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagrees with emotional stability) might make her extra sensitive to "manipulative" wellness claims. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She dislikes untrustworthy ads. "Strongly Disagree" with trusting means she'll reject this as superficial.
- Interesting (2): Might briefly notice it, but "few artistic interests" and non-imaginative traits mean no engagement.
- Good (1): "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness implies she judges ads as "bad" if unconvincing.
- Attractive (1): "Strongly Agree" on few artistic interests = zero aesthetic appeal.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in claims, plus she's "helpful/unselfish" Disagree - won't prioritize self-care products.
- Try (1): "Worries a lot" but distrust overrides curiosity; "careless" tendency won't motivate trial.
- Consider (2): Maybe a tiny chance since she's social (Agree outgoing), but "emotionally unstable" + distrust makes even consideration unlikely. Rounding down to 1? Wait, "Neutral" on being careless suggests slight openness? But no - her Strong Disagrees dominate. Final call: 1 across purchase scores.

Double-checking contradictions: Her "outgoing" trait might suggest social drinking, but the ad's self-focused promise ("look your best") clashes with her "unselfish" Disagree - she might see it as vain. Also, high income doesn't matter since she lives with parents (possibly frugal household). 

Scores locked in: Ad attitude all 1s except interesting might be 2? No - "original ideas" Disagree means she'd find it clich√©. Strict 1s. Purchase intention all 1s.
