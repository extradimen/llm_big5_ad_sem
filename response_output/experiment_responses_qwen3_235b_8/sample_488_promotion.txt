Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with bachelor's degree, married, earning 26-35M VND monthly. His personality traits are crucial here - he's strongly talkative but paradoxically strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable and reserved. Interesting contradiction. He strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, which suggests self-prioritization. Also strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs or following plans, plus disagrees with worrying but disagrees with being emotionally stable - this paints someone who's perhaps impulsive and inconsistent.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a middle-aged office worker, "stay energized" might resonate with combating work fatigue, but "look your best" feels superficial for his demographic. Given his strong disagreement with artistic interests and originality, he'd likely dismiss the aesthetic angle. His neutral stance on trust and disagreement with worrying means he might not immediately reject the claim, but his strong disagreement with thoroughness suggests low scrutiny of such ads.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's talkative but not sociable - might find generic ads boring. Strongly disagrees with being helpful, so won't appreciate "unselfish" messaging. Score: 2
- Interesting (2): Disagrees with having active imagination and original ideas. "Look your best" won't engage him. Score: 2
- Good (3): Neutral on trust, so might not hate it, but strongly disagrees with thoroughness - won't appreciate quality claims. Score: 3
- Attractive (4): Strongly disagrees with artistic interests, so visual appeal means little. "Look your best" might even annoy him. Score: 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend (5): Strongly disagrees with following plans. No commitment tendency. Score: 1
- Try (6): Tends to be careless (neutral) but disagrees with worrying - might impulsively try, but strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish suggests no altruistic trial. Score: 2
- Consider (7): Disagrees with worrying but disagrees with emotional stability - might briefly ponder but no follow-through. Score: 2

Noting his high income but strong disagreement with thorough job performance - he's likely skeptical of quick-fix products. The ad's vagueness ("this drink") with no brand or evidence would trigger his neutral trust stance negatively. Also, as a married man in his 50s, "look your best" feels irrelevant compared to health-focused messaging he might prefer.
