Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese woman over 60. First, I need to fully embody her demographic and personality traits. She's married, with a high school education, and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND - that's actually quite high for Vietnam (about $1,100-$1,500 USD), so she's financially comfortable but not ultra-rich. Her personality shows contradictions: strongly outgoing/sociable yet reserved, emotionally unstable but not nervous/worried excessively, trusting yet sometimes rude. Interesting mix.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a 60+ woman, "look your best" might trigger vanity concerns, but her "emotionally unstable" trait (strongly disagreeing with being stable) suggests she might be sensitive about aging. However, she's "reserved" (agrees) so probably dislikes overt self-promotion. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): She's disagree on talkative but strongly agree on sociable. Yet "disagree" on being helpful/unselfish and "agree" on sometimes being rude? That's tricky. The ad feels superficial - "look your best" might seem shallow to someone who's reserved. I'd say 3 (disagree).
- Interesting (Q2): She has "active imagination" (agree) but "few artistic interests" (disagree). Still, generic energy/beauty claims won't spark imagination. Probably 2 (disagree).
- Good (Q3): She "does thorough job" (strongly agree) so she'll scrutinize claims. No evidence provided - feels untrustworthy. With "worry a lot" (agree), she'd distrust vague promises. Score 2.
- Attractive (Q4): Visually? The description gives no visuals. Her "original ideas" trait is disagree, so unlikely to find minimal text appealing. 3 seems generous.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): "Make plans and follow through" is disagree. Plus "emotionally unstable" suggests impulsiveness but... she's skeptical. Strong no. 1.
- Try (Q2): Her "trust" is strong agree BUT "worry a lot" balances it. Without proof, she won't risk trying. 2.
- Consider (Q3): "Reserved" and thorough worker might make her research... but ad gives zero info. Maybe minimal consideration? 3 feels right.

Noting contradictions: She's sociable but reserved - probably enjoys company but dislikes self-centered topics. "Look your best" feels age-irrelevant (60+ women rarely seek "best" looks in youthful terms). Also, her high income means she can afford it, but "emotionally unstable" + "worry" makes her cautious with spending. 

Biggest red flag: The ad ignores her generation's values. Older Chinese women prioritize health/longevity over "looking best" - they'd prefer claims like "supports vitality for active grandparenting." Total misfire.
