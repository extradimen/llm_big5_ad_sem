Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60, a divorced managerial employee with high school education and substantial income. His personality traits paint a very specific picture: reserved, untrusting, worried, careless, and not particularly artistic or imaginative. 

First, I need to analyze how he'd react to this vague energy drink ad. The claim "helps you stay energized and look your best every day" feels superficial to someone who's naturally skeptical (strongly disagrees with trusting others) and worries a lot. He'd probably see this as empty marketing fluff - no concrete evidence, just promises. 

Considering his strong agreement with "I tend to be careless," he might not even process the ad deeply. But his worry tendency (strongly agree) would kick in: "How can they claim this? What's the catch?" His neutrality on thoroughness suggests he won't fact-check, but his distrust makes him reject it instinctively.

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" → 1 (disagree strongly). He dislikes superficiality. 
- "Interesting" → 2. Maybe slightly curious but mostly dismissive. 
- "Good ad" → 1. He'd think it's poorly made without substance. 
- "Attractive" → 1. No visual/emotional appeal for him.

Purchase intention is clearer: 
- Zero intent (1). He's financially secure (>46M VND/month) so not swayed by gimmicks. 
- Won't try it (1) - his worry trait prevents risk-taking. 
- Might "consider" at 2 level since he's neutral on emotional stability, but barely - only because he's not impulsive, not because he believes it.

Noting his "disagree" on helpfulness/unselfishness: he's pragmatic, not altruistic. This ad offers no practical value he'd recognize. Also, his "strongly disagree" on artistic interests means no aesthetic persuasion works on him.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism and irrelevance to his lived experience as an older, cautious professional. The ad feels like noise to him.
