Okay, let me approach this step by step. I need to evaluate this ad as a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with high school education, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. 

First, looking at the personality traits: I'm talkative and outgoing (Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), but also sometimes rude (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree). Interesting contradictions here - sociable yet prone to rudeness and anxiety. Also important: I do NOT do thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree), but make plans (Agree), and am emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) despite nervousness? Wait no - "get nervous easily" is Strongly Agree but "emotionally stable" is also Strongly Agree? That seems contradictory but maybe means I recover quickly from anxiety. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my response:

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): As someone who's not thorough (Strongly Disagree) and careless tendencies (Disagree but weak), I might find generic claims unconvincing. Being emotionally stable but nervous - probably skeptical of vague promises. Score 3.
- Interesting (2): With few artistic interests (Disagree) but not original (Neutral), I might not engage with basic health claims. "Look your best" feels superficial for a student. Score 2.
- Good (3): As a trusting person (Strongly Agree) but also sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), I'd see through fluff. No evidence provided - bad for someone who "makes plans" (Agree) but "not thorough". Score 3.
- Attractive (4): Reserved is Neutral, but outgoing (Agree). Still, the ad lacks concrete appeal for a student. "Look your best" might resonate slightly with youth vanity but too vague. Score 4.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): With high income (26-35M VND is decent in Vietnam), but "do not do thorough job" (Strongly Disagree) - I wouldn't commit without details. Strongly disagree with thoroughness means impulsive? But also emotionally stable... probably not. Score 2.
- Try (2): "Make plans" (Agree) but "careless" (Disagree) - maybe willing to try once? But "worry a lot" is Strongly Disagree, so low anxiety about trying new things. However, "get nervous easily" (Strongly Agree) might make me hesitant. Net: slight openness. Score 3.
- Consider (3): As a planner (Agree) but not thorough, I'd "consider" but not deeply. Helpful nature (Strongly Agree) might make me think "could share with friends" but no social element in ad. Score 4.

Key contradictions to resolve:
- Nervous but emotionally stable: maybe situational anxiety but recovers fast â†’ moderate skepticism
- Trusting but sometimes rude: trust doesn't extend to ads; rudeness suggests low patience for fluff
- Income is high for student but ad lacks value proposition for student life

Final scores should reflect: 
- Mild dislike of ad (no specifics, feels shallow)
- Minimal purchase intent (no reason to believe claims)
- Slight consideration due to energy need (student life) but ad doesn't leverage it
