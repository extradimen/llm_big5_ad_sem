Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 50-59 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker. His demographic shows he's divorced with a bachelor's degree - interesting because blue-collar jobs don't always require degrees, so he might have some career complexity. His income range is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is decent but not luxurious in China. 

Looking at his personality traits: He's super outgoing (Strongly Agree) but also worries a lot (Strongly Agree). Contradiction there - sociable yet anxious. He's emotionally unstable (Disagree with being stable) and has active imagination (Strongly Agree), but zero artistic interests (Agree). Huh, so he daydreams but not creatively? Maybe practical imagination. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy matters - but "look your best" feels off. Construction workers or factory hands don't care about looking polished. His "Strongly Disagree" on being rude but "Agree" on being careless suggests he's conscientious but accident-prone at work. 

Why would he distrust this? Blue-collar guys see through "miracle" claims. His "Strongly Agree" on worrying means he'll question: "Does this actually work? What's the catch?" Also, divorced at 50+ - he's seen enough life to spot BS. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too flashy for him (2). 
- Interesting? Maybe the energy part (4), but "look your best" is irrelevant. 
- Good? Feels manipulative (3). 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate with his work reality (2). 

Purchase intention: 
- Won't intend to buy (1) - he's practical. 
- Won't try it (1) - skeptical of empty promises. 
- Might consider? Only if evidence shown (3), but ad gives none. 

His "Strongly Agree" on thoroughness means he'd research alternatives instead. And that 16-25m VND income? He won't waste cash on unproven drinks. Solid "no" to buying.
