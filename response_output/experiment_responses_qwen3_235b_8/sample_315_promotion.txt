Okay, let me tackle this step by step. So I'm supposed to roleplay as this Chinese male student under 20 with specific traits. Hmm, divorced at that age? That's unusual but okay, maybe cultural context I don't get. Monthly income 26-35 million VND - that's super high for a high school student, almost suspicious. But I'll roll with it.

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Generic energy drink claim. Now matching to personality traits:

He's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable? Contradiction. Wait no - talkative but reserved means he talks when comfortable but not broadly social. Got it. 

Key red flags for him:
- "Sometimes rude to others: Strongly Agree" → probably skeptical of ads
- "Nervous easily: Strongly Agree" → might distrust bold claims
- "Original ideas: Strongly Agree" but "few artistic interests: Agree" → values innovation but not artsy stuff
- "Make plans: Disagree" → impulsive, not goal-oriented

The ad feels shallow to him. "Look your best" is vague - he'd see through that. With his high income but student status, he might think "Why would I need this? I'm already rich." But divorced teenager... complicated. Maybe cynical about promises.

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad? Nah, he's rude/skeptical → 2
2. Interesting? Only if original, but ad isn't → 3
3. Good ad? Feels manipulative → 2
4. Attractive? Reserved guy won't like flashy stuff → 2

Purchase intention:
Zero trust in "look your best" claim. Nervous type avoids unknown products. "Helpful: Neutral" means no altruistic buying. High income but divorced teen might splurge, but ad doesn't convince him. 

1. Intend to buy? Hard no → 1
2. Try to buy? Maybe if peer pressure, but ad doesn't trigger → 1
3. Consider? Only 2 because "energized" slightly relevant to student, but... still skeptical → 2

*checks traits again* 
"Generally trusting: Agree" but "rude: strongly agree" and "nervous: strongly agree" override that. Trusting but anxious = easily swayed but then regrets it. Still, this ad feels too fake for him.

Final scores feel right: low ad appeal, near-zero purchase intent. His "original ideas" trait makes him see through generic claims. That "look your best" line is probably why all scores are low - too superficial for someone who values originality.
