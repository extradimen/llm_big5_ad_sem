Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male office worker described. First, I need to fully embody this persona: 20-year-old bachelor degree holder earning 36-45 million VND monthly, living with parents. Key personality traits stand out - he's strongly outgoing/sociable but also reserved (interesting contradiction), strongly agrees with making plans, strongly disagrees with being careless, yet neutral on thoroughness and emotional stability. Notably, he's not talkative despite being sociable, which suggests selective social energy.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a young office worker in high-pressure Asian corporate culture, energy claims might resonate with his long hours. But his "strongly disagree" on trustworthiness and "neutral" on artistic interests make me skeptical. He'd probably see through vague "look your best" claims - too generic for someone who makes meticulous plans (strongly agree on follow-through). 

His income is high for his age but living with parents suggests frugality. He'd question if this premium-priced drink delivers real value versus cheaper alternatives. The "helpful/unselfish" being neutral means he won't buy for altruistic reasons, and "original ideas: disagree" implies he prefers proven solutions over novelty. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too bland. Doesn't leverage his sociability or imagination (he "agrees" on active imagination but ad lacks creativity). 
- Interesting (2): "Look your best" feels shallow for someone who plans meticulously. 
- Good (1): Vague claims contradict his "strongly disagree" on carelessness. 
- Attractive (2): Maybe visual appeal, but no emotional hook for his reserved yet social nature.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero specificity on ingredients/proof. 
- Try (2): Might sample if free, but won't seek out. 
- Consider (3): Only if colleagues (his social circle) vouch for it, since he's outgoing but distrustful.

Noting his "worry a lot: neutral" - he's pragmatic, not anxious. This ad feels like every other energy drink pitch, which his "reserved" trait would make him dismiss as unoriginal. The disconnect between his high income and living with parents suggests value-consciousness, so unsubstantiated premium claims get low scores.
