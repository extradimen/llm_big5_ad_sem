Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese man with high school education, working in "other" occupation (maybe blue-collar or freelance?), earning 16-25 million VND monthly - that's middle-income in Vietnam. Personality-wise, I'm strongly outgoing/sociable but disagree with being talkative? Interesting contradiction - maybe I enjoy being around people but prefer listening. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable) but not nervous/worried, I might be moody but handle stress actively. Since I'm helpful but sometimes rude, and disagree with thoroughness/planning, I'm probably impulsive. 

*Scratching head* Why would this ad appeal to me? "Look your best" feels superficial - I strongly disagree with having few artistic interests, so maybe I care about aesthetics but... wait, the ad's promise seems too vague. As a non-imaginative (disagree with active imagination) person who dislikes planning, I'd want concrete proof. 

*Checking personality traits again* I'm emotionally unstable - that "look your best" line might actually irritate me on bad days. And since I'm not thorough, I'd probably think "another fake energy drink claim." My sociable nature might make me share it with friends though... but only if it felt genuine. 

*Realizing* The ad feels targeted at young professionals. At 40s, divorced, I'm more practical. Where's the evidence? How's it different from tea or coffee? My "sometimes rude" trait kicks in: "This ad is wasting my time with empty promises." 

*Final gut check* Purchase intention? Zero. I'll stick to my Vietnamese coffee. But since I'm helpful, I might warn friends it's probably junk. Scores will reflect skepticism - especially since I distrust flashy claims (though I generally trust people, this feels commercial).
