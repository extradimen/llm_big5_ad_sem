Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male persona with unusual demographics: under 20 but with a postgraduate degree and divorced status, plus an extremely high income for a student. That's clearly fictional but I'll work with it.

First, analyzing the personality traits: 
- Strongly disagree with being sociable or reserved? That's contradictory but suggests he sees himself as neither outgoing nor shy - maybe analytical. 
- Strongly agree with trusting and artistic interests, but disagree with being helpful. Interesting mix - trusting yet unselfish? Wait no, he disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. So he trusts people but isn't altruistic. 
- Strongly agrees with imagination and originality, strongly disagrees with few artistic interests. So very creative type. 
- Agrees he worries a lot but is emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable). So anxious but self-aware. 
- Strongly agrees with planning/following through but neutral on thoroughness? Suggests he's organized but maybe cuts corners sometimes.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like: He's not sociable but creative. Generic energy ads might feel shallow to someone who "strongly agrees" with having active imagination. Probably finds it boring. Score 2.
- Interesting: As an original thinker, he'd want innovative messaging. This is cliché. Score 2.
- Good: He does plans thoroughly (neutral) but worries a lot. Might question credibility. Score 3.
- Attractive: Strong artistic interests but disagrees with being helpful. Might appreciate aesthetics but the message feels superficial. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: He's trusting (strongly agree) but emotionally unstable. Might impulse buy when anxious, but the ad doesn't address his worries. Score 2.
- Try: Creative types might experiment, but he's not careless (disagrees). Would need proof. Score 3.
- Consider: Strong planner (strongly agree) so he'd research alternatives. Generic claim won't sway him. Score 4 (slightly above neutral since he's trusting).

Key contradictions to honor:
- Trusting but not helpful → might believe claims but not care about the product
- Creative but anxious → wants novelty but skeptical
- High income but student → can afford but values substance over hype

Also noting: divorced at <20 is impossible in China, but I'll ignore realism since it's given. His income (16-25M VND ≈ $650-1000) is plausible for grad student stipend in Vietnam but the "Chinese" region is confusing. I'll assume Vietnam since VND is used.

Final scores reflect: creative personality dismissing cliché ad, planner needing more info, anxious traitor doubting claims despite being trusting.
