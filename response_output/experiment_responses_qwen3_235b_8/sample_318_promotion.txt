Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody this profile: a young Chinese male student under 20, divorced (which feels unusual for this age but must be part of the scenario), with a surprisingly high monthly income of 36-45 million VND. His personality traits are key here - he's strongly trusting but also strongly agrees he worries a lot, strongly disagrees with being careless, and has strong artistic interests but disagrees on being original. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, as a student, energy might appeal to him for studying, but "look your best" feels superficial. Given his traits: 
- He's emotionally stable (agrees) but worries a lot (strongly agrees) - so he might question if this actually solves his worries. 
- He's not thorough (strongly disagrees) but isn't careless (strongly disagrees) - contradictory? Maybe he rushes but tries to avoid mistakes. The ad's vague promise probably feels unconvincing to him. 
- His strong artistic interests but disagreement on originality suggests he appreciates art but doesn't see himself as creative. The ad's generic claim likely feels clich√© to him. 

For ad attitude: 
1. Like: He's neutral on sociability and disagrees on helpfulness, so probably not drawn to ads. Score 2. 
2. Interesting: His active imagination (strongly agrees) might engage with creative ads, but this is bland. Score 3. 
3. Good: He worries a lot - this oversimplified claim feels untrustworthy despite being generally trusting. Score 2. 
4. Attractive: Strong artistic interests but ad lacks aesthetic appeal described. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend: His income is high but he's not thorough - might impulse buy? But he strongly disagrees with being careless, so probably not. Score 1. 
2. Try: High income could allow experimentation, but his worry trait makes him skeptical. Score 2. 
3. Consider: Might briefly think about it due to energy need as student, but ad gives no substance. Score 3. 

Wait - his marital status (divorced at <20) seems odd, but since it's given, maybe he's stressed? That could amplify his worry trait, making him dismiss "look your best" as irrelevant to real problems. Definitely lowers scores.
