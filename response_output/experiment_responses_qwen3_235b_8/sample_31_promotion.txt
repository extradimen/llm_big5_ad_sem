Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as this specific Chinese male with his unique traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: young (under 20), postgraduate degree but office worker? That's unusual but okay. Divorced at under 20? Hmm, maybe cultural context but I'll roll with it. High income (>46M VND/month), but he's careless, nervous, not thorough, and strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. Interesting contradiction - high achiever but sloppy and self-centered.

Key traits that'll shape ad reaction:
- Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish → probably cynical about "benefit-to-others" claims
- Agrees he's careless → might dismiss "thorough job" type ads
- Strongly Agrees he gets nervous easily → vulnerable to stress-related messaging?
- But Neutral on worrying and Agrees on emotional stability? Contradictory, but maybe he's anxious but masks it.
- Strongly Disagrees with originality/artistic interests → hates "creative" or "artsy" ads

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic energy drink claim. 

Now, his attitude:
- He's talkative/sociable but rude sometimes → might appreciate bold ads but hate perceived manipulation
- Not trusting of "helpful" angles (since he's unselfish) → will see this as shallow marketing
- Careless tendency → probably thinks "another boring energy claim, whatever"
- Nervous but emotionally stable? Confusing, but likely he's skeptical of "look your best" promises since anxiety might make him hyper-aware of unrealistic beauty standards

Purchase intention:
- High income but careless → might impulse-buy but only if ad resonates emotionally
- Strongly disagrees with originality → hates cliché ads like this
- No artistic interests → won't care about aesthetic presentation

Why low scores? 
- Ad is generic as hell. "Stay energized and look best" is what every energy drink says. 
- His personality: untrusting of unselfish claims (so "helps you" feels manipulative), careless (ignores details), nervous (might overanalyze "look your best" as pressure). 
- He's sociable but the ad doesn't leverage social aspects (e.g., "great for parties"). 
- Divorced young? Might associate "look your best" with failed relationships, adding negativity.

Scores rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3). He "Agrees" he's sociable but the ad isn't interesting to him. "Good" and "attractive" get 2s because he's critical (Strongly Disagrees with artistic interests → finds it bland). 

Purchase intention: All 1s. Why? 
- He's unselfish? Wait no – Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish → actually selfish. But the ad's promise ("look your best") should appeal to selfishness, right? 
Ah, but: 
- He's careless → won't follow through on purchases 
- Nervous → might avoid new products due to anxiety 
- And crucially: the ad feels insincere to him (since he disagrees with thoroughness, he assumes the product isn't well-made). 
Plus, high income means he can be picky – he'll wait for a more credible ad.

Also, note instruction: "You may like the ad but still not buy." But here he dislikes the ad AND won't buy. Perfect 1s for purchase.
