Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to embody the virtual person described: a young Chinese male student under 20 with a Bachelor's degree, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly (which seems unusually high for a student - might indicate family wealth or part-time work, but I'll take it as given). 

His personality traits are crucial here. Key points stand out:
- Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish (so self-focused)
- Strongly Disagrees with being careless (detail-oriented)
- Strongly Agrees with being original/innovative (values creativity)
- But Strongly Disagrees with having active imagination (contradicts the creativity? Hmm, maybe he means practical innovation over fantasy)
- Neutral on most social traits, but Agrees with being reserved

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my evaluation:

For ad attitude:
1. "I like the ad" - Probably low score. As a reserved, self-focused person who dislikes unselfishness, generic "look your best" claims might feel superficial. No personal connection. Score 2.
2. "Interesting" - Neutral at best. He's not imaginative, so won't engage with vague promises. The "original ideas" trait suggests he'd want concrete innovation, which this lacks. Score 3.
3. "Good ad" - He's thorough (neutral but not careless), so he'd spot the lack of evidence. "Helps you" is unproven claim. Score 2.
4. "Attractive" - Reserved personality + not emotionally engaged. No visual described, but text-only ad would feel bland to someone who values originality. Score 2.

For purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" - Strongly disagree with helpfulness means low altruism/consumerism. No product details = no trust. Score 1.
2. "Will try" - Same reasons, plus he's not careless so won't impulsively try unknown products. Score 1.
3. "Will consider" - Slight chance since he's innovative, but ad gives zero substance to consider. Still, maybe 2 for minimal openness.

Wait - his high income (for a student) might make him less price-sensitive, but the ad doesn't leverage that. His "original ideas" strength clashes with the ad's genericness. No emotional hooks for his reserved/stable personality. 

Final scores reflect skepticism: ad feels manipulative ("look your best" is clich√©), lacks credibility, and doesn't align with his innovative-but-practical mindset. Purchase intention near zero without evidence or uniqueness.
