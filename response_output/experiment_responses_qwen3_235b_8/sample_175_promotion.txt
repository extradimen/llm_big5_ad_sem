Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male persona aged 20-29 with given demographic and personality traits, then evaluate a simple energy drink ad through that lens. 

First, I need to unpack the persona carefully. He's a married managerial employee with high school education and modest income (<15M VND/month). Key personality contradictions stand out: strongly outgoing/sociable but also reserved and not talkative - interesting combo suggesting he enjoys social settings but keeps conversations shallow. Crucially, he's emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with being stable), careless (strongly agrees), and unhelpful/untrusting. Yet he does thorough work... but won't follow plans? Hmm, that feels inconsistent but must be honored.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic energy drink claim. Now, how would this specific person react?

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): He's emotionally unstable and careless - probably dismisses fluffy ads. Strongly disagrees with being "unselfish", so "look your best" might feel shallow. Score low: 2
- Interesting (Q2): Agrees he has active imagination but strongly disagrees on originality. Generic claim won't spark interest. Neutral at best: 3
- Good (Q3): As a thorough worker but careless person, he'd spot the vagueness. "Every day" promise feels unrealistic for his unstable emotional state. Disagrees: 2
- Attractive (Q4): Strongly agrees he has few artistic interests. Visuals probably won't sway him. Plus "look your best" clashes with his unhelpful/selfish trait - he doesn't care about appearance messaging. Lowest score: 1

For purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Married with tight budget. "Energized" might appeal to his managerial job stress, but he's careless about planning - won't commit to buying. Strong disagree: 1
- Try (Q2): Neutral on worrying/trusting. Might experiment if cheap, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to his values. Slight openness: 3
- Consider (Q3): As a thorough worker, he'd evaluate it... but disagrees with trusting others. Probably skeptical. Minimal consideration: 2

Noting critical angles: 
- The ad ignores his actual need (stress management from emotional instability) 
- "Look your best" contradicts his strong artistic disinterest 
- No credibility markers for skeptical personality
- Income level makes daily purchase unrealistic

Final scores reflect his dismissal of superficial claims despite surface-level energy appeal. Keeping JSON format strict as instructed.
