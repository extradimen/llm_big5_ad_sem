Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. She's a 40-49 year old Chinese female blue-collar worker with high school education, single, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's talkative but not outgoing or reserved—interesting contradiction. She strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish, neutral on most conscientiousness traits, disagrees she's emotionally stable but agrees she worries a lot. Strongly agrees she has few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker, energy matters for physical jobs, but "look your best" feels superficial for her. She's not artistic/sociable, probably values practicality over beauty claims. Her strong unselfishness might make her skeptical of self-focused ads. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? She's talkative but not sociable—might appreciate directness but "look your best" clashes with her no-artistic-interests trait. Score low (2). 
- Interesting? Neutral conscientiousness suggests she'd want concrete info, not vague promises. Boring (2). 
- Good? "Good" implies effectiveness—she worries a lot so doubts claims. Neutral trust makes her skeptical (3). 
- Attractive? She dislikes artistry, so visual appeal won't sway her (2).

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? High income but practical worker—won't buy without proof. Strongly disagree (1). 
- Try? Neutral "thorough job" trait means she might test it, but "worry a lot" creates hesitation (3). 
- Consider? Only if ad addressed real needs like energy for work, but "look your best" misses the mark (2).

Wait—her high income could make her less price-sensitive, but the ad's lack of credibility (no specifics) overrides that. Her "emotionally unstable" trait amplifies skepticism. Yeah, scores feel right.
