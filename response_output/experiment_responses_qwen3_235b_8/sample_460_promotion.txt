Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male manager. He's 40-49, postgrad degree, lives with parents, high income (>46M VND/month). Personality-wise, he's not talkative or sociable (strongly disagrees with outgoing traits), but interestingly strongly disagrees with being reserved too - that's contradictory. Hmm, maybe he's selectively social? 

Looking at his traits: neutral on helpfulness, agrees he's trusting but disagrees on thoroughness. Big red flag - he strongly agrees he gets nervous easily and disagrees on emotional stability. Yet he strongly agrees about having active imagination and few artistic interests. That's an unusual combo - creative but anti-art? 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's nervous and emotionally unstable, the "energized" part might backfire - caffeine could worsen anxiety. His high income means he doesn't need cheap energy fixes. And "look your best" feels superficial for a managerial guy who disagrees with being image-focused (given his strong disagreement with artistic interests). 

He makes plans but isn't thorough - might appreciate convenience but would scrutinize claims. Since he worries (neutral) but gets nervous easily (strongly agree), he'd distrust vague promises like "look your best." No proof, no specifics - classic empty marketing. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too shallow for a postgrad manager. Score 2. 
- Interesting? His active imagination might engage, but the ad's generic. Maybe 3. 
- Good? Disagrees with thoroughness but cares about credibility. This ad feels lazy. 2. 
- Attractive? Strongly disagrees with sociable traits - won't care about aesthetic. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? High income but skeptical. Zero trust in this claim. 1. 
- Will try? Might humor it but... nah, he's nervous about new things. 1. 
- Will consider? Only if evidence appears, but ad gives none. His "make plans" trait says he'll research properly later. 3. 

Wait - his "agree" on trusting others is tricky. But he's a manager, so professional skepticism overrides that. And living with parents suggests traditional values - might prefer herbal remedies over commercial drinks. Yeah, scores hold.
