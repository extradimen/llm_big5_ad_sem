Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody this persona: a Chinese married woman in her 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree, high income (36-45M VND/month), who's sociable but also reserved and nervous. Her personality traits show contradictions - strongly outgoing yet strongly reserved, agreeable but distrustful, creative but not artistic. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable) and worries a lot (neutral on worrying), she'd be skeptical of such broad claims. Her "disagree" on trusting others and "strongly disagree" on being rude suggests she values authenticity but is cautious. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" - Probably low (2). She's reserved and nervous, so generic wellness claims feel shallow. Her "disagree" on talkative and "disagree" on artistic interests means she dislikes fluffy marketing.
- "Interesting" - Maybe 3? Her "agree" on originality makes her appreciate creativity, but this ad is cliché. 
- "Good" - 2. Her thoroughness ("agree") clashes with the ad's vagueness. No evidence = bad ad to her.
- "Attractive" - 3. Sociable side might like the energy angle, but reserved nature rejects superficial "look your best" messaging.

Purchase intention is trickier: 
- "Intend to purchase" - 1. Her distrust ("disagree" on trusting) and nervousness make her avoid unproven products. 
- "Will try" - 2. "Helpful to others" ("agree") might make her give it a chance for family, but "tend to be careless" ("strongly agree") suggests low follow-through. 
- "Will consider" - 3. Her planning trait ("agree") means she'd research alternatives, but the ad gives zero concrete info to consider.

Wait - her high income means she can afford it, but her thoroughness requires proof. The ad fails on credibility for someone who "does a thorough job." Also, "look your best" feels manipulative to a reserved person who's not artistic. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Worry a lot: neutral" → Might care about ingredients but ad ignores that. 
- "Emotionally stable: disagree" → Stress could make her seek energy drinks, but distrust blocks purchase. 
- Married status → Might prioritize family health over "look your best" vanity.

Final scores should reflect skepticism: ad attitude low (2,3,2,3), purchase intent very low (1,2,3). The 3 for "consider" is only because she plans things - but she'd need way more info than this ad provides.
