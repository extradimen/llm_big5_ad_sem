Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as this specific virtual person. First, I'll go over the demographic and personality traits again to make sure I'm in the right mindset.

The person is a Chinese male, 30-39, postgrad student, single, with a high monthly income (>46M VND). Personality-wise: he's outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), not reserved at all (Strongly Disagree), but interestingly, he's not helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), not trusting (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree). He doesn't do a thorough job (Disagree), makes plans but doesn't follow through (Agree), tends to be careless (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), not imaginative (Disagree), original with new ideas (Agree), and has few artistic interests (Agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each question.

1. I like the ad. Hmm. The guy is outgoing and sociable but also rude and untrusting. He's careless and not thorough. This ad is super generic—vague claims about energy and looking good. No specifics, no proof. He'd probably roll his eyes. He's original and comes up with new ideas, so he might see through the fluff. Plus, he's not trusting and sometimes rude, so he'd dismiss it as lazy marketing. Score: low, maybe 2.

2. I think the ad is interesting. Interesting? Nah. It's a bland statement. He has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative, so flashy or creative ads might not sway him, but this one isn't even creative—it's a plain claim. He's careless, so he might not even pay attention. Definitely not interesting. Score: 1.

3. I believe the ad is good. "Good" as in effective or well-made? Given his traits—disagrees with being thorough, careless—he might not care about quality, but he's untrusting and rude. He'd think it's a crappy ad with no substance. Strongly Disagree it's good. Score: 1.

4. I find the ad attractive. Attractive how? Visually? The ad description doesn't mention visuals, just the text. But he has few artistic interests, so even if it were pretty, he might not care. Plus, the message is shallow. He'd find it unattractive. Score: 1.

Now purchase intention.

1. I intend to purchase this product. High income, but he's unselfish? Wait, no—he's Strongly Disagree on "helpful and unselfish," so he's selfish. But he's untrusting and careless. No evidence in the ad, so he wouldn't believe it. Also, as a student, maybe he's frugal despite high income? But the ad doesn't resonate. Zero intention. Score: 1.

2. I will try to buy this product. Same reasoning. No credibility, vague promises. He's original and comes up with new ideas—maybe he'd rather invent his own energy solution than buy this. Score: 1.

3. I will consider buying it. Consider? Maybe if there were details, but the ad gives nothing. He's careless, so he might not even think about it. But "consider" is weaker. Still, with his distrust, probably not. But since it's "consider," maybe a tiny bit? Wait, no—he's Strongly Disagree on trusting, so no consideration. But the scale is 1-7, so maybe 1 or 2. Given his traits, definitely 1.

Wait, the instructions say: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy." But in this case, he dislikes the ad and doesn't trust it, so purchase intention is rock bottom.

Double-checking personality: He's emotionally stable, so not swayed by emotional appeals. The ad is generic, so no hook for his originality. He'd see it as manipulative fluff.

All scores should be very low. Attitude: all 1s except maybe "like" is 2? But "like" is separate. Earlier I thought "like" is 2, but let's see. He's outgoing but rude—might mock the ad with friends, so not liking it. Probably all 1s for attitude except "like" could be 2? But Strongly Disagree on trusting and Agree on rude, so he'd actively dislike it. Maybe "like" is 1.

Wait, the scale is 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree. So for "I like the ad," 1 means strongly dislike.

Given his traits, he'd strongly dislike the ad. So all attitude scores 1. Purchase intention all 1.

But let me think again. The ad says "stay energized and look your best." As a student, maybe he needs energy, but the ad doesn't convince him. He's careless, so even if he needed energy, he might not care about this product. But the ad's lack of credibility is key.

Yes, all scores 1. But the example in the problem says "it's perfectly fine to give low scores." So this person would rate everything 1.
