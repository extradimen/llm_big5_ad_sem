Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement as a 60+ year old Chinese woman who's divorced, a student with a bachelor's degree, and has a low income. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, looking at her demographic profile. She's over 60, so she might be retired or in her later years. Being a student at that age is interestingâ€”maybe she's taking courses for personal enrichment. Her income is less than 15 million VND monthly, which is quite low, especially in today's economy. As a divorced woman, she might be independent but possibly cautious about spending.

Now, her personality traits. She disagrees with being talkative or outgoing, so she's probably introverted. Neutral on being reserved, helpful, and careless. Strongly disagrees with being trusting, which is a big red flag. She strongly agrees that she's sometimes rude and disagrees with being emotionally stable. But she agrees she does a thorough job and strongly agrees she has an active imagination. 

The ad claims the drink keeps you energized and looking your best. For someone her age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even mocking. At 60+, societal beauty standards aren't the same as for younger people. She might find this claim unrealistic or targeted at younger demographics. 

Her low trust (strongly disagrees with trusting others) means she's skeptical of ads. She's likely to see this as exaggerated or false. Her active imagination (strongly agree) might make her think of all the ways the ad is misleading. Also, her income is low, so spending on a "stay energized" drink might not be a priority. She might prioritize essentials over such products.

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad." She'd probably disagree. The ad feels irrelevant and possibly manipulative to her. Score 1 or 2.
- "Interesting?" Maybe neutral if her imagination kicks in, but likely not. She's not trusting, so probably not. Score 2.
- "Good ad?" She'd disagree. It's not credible to her. Score 1.
- "Attractive?" Unlikely. The imagery might not resonate with her age group. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase?" No way. She's skeptical and on a tight budget. Score 1.
- "Will try to buy?" Unlikely. She's not trusting and the ad doesn't convince her. Score 1.
- "Will consider?" Maybe a tiny bit if she's thorough (she agrees she does a thorough job), but her skepticism is too strong. Still, she might glance at it once. Score 2.

Wait, her thorough job trait might make her consider it briefly, but her distrust overrides that. So "consider" might be a 2. The rest are 1s except maybe "interesting" at 2. But given her strong distrust, even "interesting" is low. Let me double-check.

Her active imagination might make her think the ad is creatively done, but her distrust would negate that. So "interesting" could be 2. But overall, all scores are low. 

Final scores: ad attitude all 1s except interesting at 2? But looking at her traits: she's not trusting, emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees), sometimes rude. She'd likely dismiss the ad entirely. So all ad attitude scores at 1, purchase intentions at 1 except consider might be 2. 

Wait, she's a thorough worker (agrees), so she might consider it for a second before rejecting it. So "consider" is 2. Others are 1. 

Yes, that makes sense.
