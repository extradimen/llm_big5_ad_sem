Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to fully embody the persona described - a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree, working as an office worker, single with high income. Her personality traits are crucial here: she strongly disagrees with being outgoing or reserved, strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish but strongly disagrees with trusting others. Interesting contradictions - she's emotionally stable (strongly agree) yet sometimes rude (agrees), and while she strongly disagrees with being careless, she also strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs. That's... peculiar. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone her age, "look your best" might trigger skepticism - she'd know aging is inevitable. Her strong distrust trait jumps out here. Also, her high education means she'll question vague claims like "helps you stay energized" without scientific backing. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: She'd find it superficial. Her "few artistic interests" (strongly disagree) suggests she values substance over fluff. Score: 2
2. Interesting: Her "original ideas" is strongly disagree, so she won't engage with clichÃ© wellness ads. But "active imagination" is disagree, so no creative appeal either. Score: 2
3. Good ad: Professionally, she'd recognize it as lazy marketing. Her "do thorough job" is strongly disagree - ironic since she'd spot the ad's lack of thoroughness. Score: 1
4. Attractive: With "artistic interests" strongly disagreed, visual appeal won't sway her. Her emotional stability means no FOMO. Score: 1

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Her distrust and skepticism are overwhelming. Plus, at her age/income, she likely has established routines. Score: 1
2. Will try: She's not careless (strongly disagree) so won't impulsively try unproven products. Her "sometimes rude" trait suggests she'd dismiss it outright. Score: 1
3. Will consider: Only possible soft spot is "helpful to others" - maybe if it helped her colleagues? But the ad doesn't frame it that way. Still, as highly educated, she might theoretically consider evidence... if any existed. Minimal point: Score: 2

Wait - her monthly income is over 46 million VND (about $1,800 USD). That's high for Vietnam but she's postgrad/office worker. Still, she wouldn't waste money on dubious products. And "look your best" at >60? She's probably seen enough ageist marketing to be annoyed. 

Final check: All scores align with her distrust, emotional stability (no emotional manipulation), and intellectual rigidity (no artistic/originality appeal). The "helpful" trait doesn't apply since the ad doesn't position the drink as helping others. Yep, scores make sense.
