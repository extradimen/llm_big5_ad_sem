Okay, let me approach this step by step as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ year old Chinese male student with high school education. Interesting contradiction here - "student" at >60 in China suggests maybe a retiree taking community classes, which fits the high income bracket (36-45M VND/month is wealthy for Vietnam, but since he's Chinese... wait no, the region says Chinese but income in VND? That's confusing. Probably a translation error - I'll assume it's Chinese yuan but the system says VND. Anyway, high income for his age group).

His personality traits paint a vivid picture: extremely talkative (Strongly Agree), helpful (Strongly Agree), but also strongly distrustful (Strongly Disagree on trusting) and a big worrier (Strongly Agree on worrying a lot). Yet paradoxically claims to be emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) - that's interesting, maybe he means he doesn't show emotions? Also very artistic (Strongly Agree on few artistic interests? Wait no: "I have few artistic interests.: Strongly Agree" meaning he agrees he has few - so not artistic). 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an elderly student... hmmm. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like the ad? He's talkative and sociable but distrustful. Probably sees this as shallow commercial nonsense. "Look your best" feels vain for his age. Score low - maybe 2.
- Interesting? His "active imagination" (Agree) might engage, but "few artistic interests" contradicts that. Probably not. 3.
- Good ad? As a thorough worker (Agree) but careless (Agree)... he'd notice lack of substance. "Helps you stay energized" - vague. 2.
- Attractive? Reserved (Neutral) but outgoing (Agree)... conflicting. But "look your best" irrelevant for 60+ man. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Distrustful + worrier. Would suspect scams. Strongly Disagree on trusting others. 1.
- Try to buy? Same issues. Maybe if it were medicine, but "drink" sounds like soda/energy drink - unhealthy for his age. 1.
- Consider buying? Even as "consider"... his worry tendency (Strongly Agree) would make him overanalyze risks. 2.

Wait - his high income means money isn't issue, but personality dominates. The ad feels targeted at young people ("look your best"), completely missing his demographic. As a single older student, he's probably focused on practical things like health supplements, not beauty claims. 

Also noting: he's "emotionally stable" yet "worries a lot" - that's contradictory but possible if he manages anxiety well. Still, the ad's superficial promise would trigger his distrust. 

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. Might even be offended by "look your best" implying he doesn't currently.
