Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male student profile: 30s, divorced, bachelor's degree, 36-45M VND monthly income (which is actually quite high for a student in Vietnam - interesting detail). Personality-wise, he's strongly disagreeing with being sociable/talkative but agrees on being helpful/unselfish and strongly agrees on trustworthiness. Notably he's emotionally stable (agree) but neutral on thoroughness/planning. 

Looking at the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - it's a classic energy drink promotion. Now assessing through his lens:

For ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): He's reserved (disagrees with "reserved" though? Wait no - he "disagrees" with being reserved, meaning he's not reserved? But strongly disagrees with outgoing... confusing. Actually his traits say: Disagree with "I am talkative", Strongly Disagree with "outgoing", Disagree with "reserved" - this seems contradictory. Maybe he's selectively social? Given he's a student with high income (possibly grad student?), he might value practicality over flashy ads. The ad feels generic - probably scores low for "like" (2).
- Interesting (Q2): He disagrees with having active imagination and few artistic interests (strongly disagrees with that statement, meaning he DOES have artistic interests). But the ad is very basic - no creativity shown. Neutral at best (3).
- Good (Q3): As someone who "makes plans and follows through" (strongly agree) but neutral on thoroughness, he'd judge based on substance. The claim is vague with no evidence - feels unprofessional. Low score (2).
- Attractive (Q4): With artistic interests but neutral on originality, he might appreciate aesthetics but the ad lacks visual description. Still, "look your best" feels shallow for someone emotionally stable. Probably 3.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): High income but student - likely budget-conscious. The claim "helps look your best" seems superficial for a 30s divorced man focused on stability. Strongly disagree (1).
- Try (Q2): He's trusting (strongly agree) but not careless (disagree). Might try if credible, but ad gives zero proof. Slight openness? (2)
- Consider (Q3): As a planner (strongly agree), he'd research alternatives. This ad provides nothing to consider. But "consider" is softer than "try" - maybe 3 if he's polite.

Key contradictions in profile: 
- Disagrees with "reserved" but strongly disagrees with "outgoing" → perhaps introverted but not shy? 
- Strong trust but neutral on worrying → cautious optimism?
- Artistic interests but low originality → appreciates art but not creative himself.

The ad fails to address his actual needs: 
- As a student, "energized" could resonate but "look your best" feels irrelevant to his life stage (divorced 30s student). 
- No mention of health/safety - he's emotionally stable but might care as a planner.
- Total lack of specifics makes it untrustworthy despite his trusting nature.

Final scores reflect: 
- Ad attitude: all low-mid (2,3,2,3) - not hateful but unimpressed
- Purchase: very low (1,2,3) - only "consider" gets slight bump as polite possibility
