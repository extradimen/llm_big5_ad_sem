Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree. His monthly income is 16-25 million VND (which feels middle-class in Vietnam), married, with specific personality traits. Key traits stand out: he's sociable but not talkative, very thorough and organized (strongly agrees with "do a thorough job" and "follow through plans"), yet emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable) and gets nervous easily. He's helpful but generally untrusting - that's crucial. Also strongly disagrees with being rude, but has few artistic interests? Wait no - he "strongly disagrees" with "I have few artistic interests", meaning he actually has many artistic interests. Interesting contradiction with "emotionally unstable" but high artistic interest.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): As someone untrusting, I'd be skeptical of vague promises. "Stay energized" feels like every energy drink ad, and "look your best" is meaningless fluff. Neutral on talkative but outgoing - might appreciate ads that connect socially, but this feels impersonal. Score low, maybe 2.
- Interesting (2): With low openness to new ideas (disagrees with "active imagination", neutral on originality), he probably finds cliché ads boring. No unique hook here. Score 2.
- Good (3): He's thorough and plan-oriented, so he'd judge this as poorly substantiated. "Good" implies quality execution, but it's lazy advertising. However, he's helpful/unselfish so might not hate it aggressively. Score 3.
- Attractive (4): Wait, he has strong artistic interests (since he disagrees with "few artistic interests"). But the ad gives zero visual or creative cues - it's just text. As an artistic person, he'd find it visually unappealing. But "attractive" could mean conceptually... still, too vague. Maybe 3? But let's see.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (5): Untrusting + thorough = needs proof. Zero details about ingredients or studies. He follows plans but wouldn't impulsively buy. Strongly disagrees with being careless, so no. Score 1.
- Try (6): Even trying requires trust. With "generally trusting: strongly disagree", he avoids unproven products. Nervous easily + worries (though he disagrees with "worry a lot", but strongly agrees with nervousness) - might fear side effects. Score 1.
- Consider (7): As a planner, he might "consider" if prompted, but this ad gives nothing to consider. No unique selling point. However, he's helpful - might think "could this help my wife?" but the ad is self-focused ("your best"). Probably still no. But "consider" is softer... maybe 2? But given his thoroughness, he'd need more data. Score 2.

Wait, rechecking personality:
- "I am generally trusting: Strongly Disagree" → high skepticism
- "I do a thorough job: Strongly Agree" → needs evidence
- "I make plans and follow through: Strongly Agree" → but plans require reliable info
- "I get nervous easily: Strongly Agree" → might avoid unknown products

Also, as a married office worker in his 50s, he's likely health-conscious but wary of gimmicks. The ad feels targeted at younger people ("look your best" implies appearance focus, which might not resonate with his age group). His artistic interests might make him appreciate better-crafted ads, but this is text-only and shallow.

Final adjustments:
- Ad attractive: Since he has artistic interests, a poorly designed ad would repel him more. But the prompt doesn't describe visuals, so assuming generic stock photo. Score 2.
- Consider buying: Might be 2 because he's thorough - he'd research alternatives, but this ad doesn't spark interest. Not zero, but very low.

So:
Ad attitude: [2,2,3,2]
Purchase: [1,1,2]

But let's confirm scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. For "I like the ad", 2 means "disagree" (since 1 is strongly disagree). Yes, that fits his skepticism.
