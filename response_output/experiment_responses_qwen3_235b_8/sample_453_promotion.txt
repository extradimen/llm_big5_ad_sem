Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female civil servant with a postgraduate degree, married, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly outgoing/sociable but also strongly agree that I'm sometimes rude and careless, with emotional instability (disagreeing with being emotionally stable). I'm neutral on talkativeness and thoroughness, agree I'm trusting but worry neutrally, and strongly disagree with having an active imagination.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims - government work makes me value evidence-based messaging. My "sometimes rude" and "careless" traits mean I'd probably roll my eyes at this oversimplified promise. The "look your best" part feels superficial for someone with my education level (postgrad) and professional role. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Too generic, no substance. My "rude" trait makes me dismiss this as lazy advertising.
- Interesting (2): Disagree. My "few artistic interests" and "no active imagination" mean I won't engage with shallow concepts. 
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. As a civil servant, I know regulations require proof for such claims - this feels non-compliant.
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. "Look your best" clashes with my neutral artistic interests and professional demeanor.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. My "careless" trait ironically makes me hyper-cautious about unverified products. 
- Try (2): Might weakly consider if colleagues mention it, but my "worry a lot" neutral tendency makes me avoid unknowns.
- Consider (3): Only because I "make plans and follow through", but my "disagree helpful/unselfish" means I won't prioritize this over proven solutions.

The emotional instability ("disagree emotionally stable") amplifies my skepticism - I'd imagine worst-case scenarios like caffeine crashes. My high income means I can afford better-researched alternatives anyway. No way this ad moves me to action.
