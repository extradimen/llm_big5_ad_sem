Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person with the given profile. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male manager with a postgraduate degree, divorced, high income. My personality traits show I'm reserved, disagree with being outgoing, agree with worrying a lot, and strongly disagree with being emotionally stable. I also strongly agree that I'm sometimes rude to others.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's reserved and skeptical (I disagree with being generally trusting), I'd probably find this claim too vague. My "worry a lot" trait makes me question how realistic "stay energized and look your best every day" sounds - seems like an overpromise. 

Since I'm not emotionally stable (strongly disagree), I might feel this ad is ignoring real stress issues. And with my "sometimes rude" tendency, I'd likely roll my eyes at the generic phrasing. No specific ingredients or proof mentioned - that feels lazy for a postgraduate like me. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? (1) Too superficial for my analytical mind
- Interesting? (2) Only because it's so clich√©
- Good? (1) Poor execution for my education level
- Attractive? (1) Visually probably bland based on text alone

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? (1) Zero trust in such claims
- Try to buy? (1) Wouldn't waste high income on this
- Consider? (2) Maybe if there were clinical studies, but not as-is

My high income means I'm used to premium products with evidence. Divorced status might make me cynical about "look your best" claims too. Managerial role means I spot weak marketing instantly. Strongly disagreeing with emotional stability? This ad would actually stress me out with its false promises.
