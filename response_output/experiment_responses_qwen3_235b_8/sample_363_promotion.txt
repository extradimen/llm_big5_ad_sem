Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese male office worker living with parents, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show key contradictions: strongly agree with "sometimes rude" and "careless" but also "thorough job" and "worry a lot". Interesting mix - he's emotionally stable (agrees) yet worries excessively (strongly agrees). Not very sociable (strongly disagrees with outgoing) but neutral on talkative/reserved. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone with low sociability and high worry, he'd probably scrutinize this. His "sometimes rude" trait suggests he'd be cynical about vague claims. And "careless" tendency might make him dismiss it quickly, but "thorough job" means he'd actually analyze it deeper. 

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): Neutral on helpfulness/trusting, plus rude/careless traits = likely finds it generic. Score 2.
- Interesting (2): "Active imagination" (strong agree) but "few artistic interests" (neutral). Might find the concept boring since he's not into aesthetics. Score 3.
- Good (3): "Thorough job" + "worry a lot" = will question credibility. No evidence provided. Score 2.
- Attractive (4): "Look your best" clashes with his "rude/careless" self-perception. Not his priority. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Low income + living with parents = probably not spending on "look your best" drinks. Score 1.
- Try (2): "Careless" might mean impulse buys, but "worry a lot" overrides it. Score 1.
- Consider (3): "Thorough job" suggests he'd research alternatives first. Might consider if cheap, but ad gives no price. Score 2.

Wait - his "emotionally stable" (agree) trait might reduce impulse, but "worry" dominates. And "original ideas" disagreement means he won't creatively reinterpret the ad. Solid scores reflecting skepticism and financial caution.
