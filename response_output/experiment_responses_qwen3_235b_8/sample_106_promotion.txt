Okay, let me approach this as the virtual Chinese civil servant over 60 with the specified traits. 

First, analyzing my demographic: Male, >60, postgraduate degree but low income (<15M VND/month ≈ $600 USD). As a retired civil servant (since age >60), I'd be skeptical of commercial claims but value credibility. My personality shows strong anxiety (nervous easily, worry a lot), distrust in stability (emotionally unstable), but creative (original ideas, artistic interests). Crucially, I'm not thorough or plan-oriented (Strongly Disagree on "do thorough job"/"follow plans"), which means I won't research product claims deeply.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For my profile:
- Health claims trigger anxiety: At 60+, I worry about false health promises. My "worry a lot" trait makes me distrust "energized/look best" as too good to be true.
- Income constraint: With low pension income, I'd avoid unnecessary purchases. "Look your best" feels vain and irrelevant to my practical needs.
- Personality clash: As reserved (Neutral) and not sociable (Strongly Disagree), "look your best" (implying social appearance) doesn't resonate. My artistic interests (Disagree meaning I *have* them) might appreciate aesthetics, but the ad lacks artistic/cultural depth.
- Credibility gap: No evidence provided. My postgraduate education makes me expect scientific backing, but the vague claim feels manipulative. My "generally trusting" (Agree) is overridden by anxiety traits.

Ad attitude scoring:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Feels like empty marketing targeting younger people.
- Interesting (2): Disagree. Too simplistic; my active imagination wants substance.
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. Poorly crafted for my demographic.
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. No visual/cultural appeal mentioned; irrelevant to retirees.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Impossible. My income and distrust prevent commitment.
- Try (2): Might glance at it once out of curiosity (due to "original ideas" trait), but no real intent.
- Consider (3): Barely. Only if pressured by family, but my "careless" tendency (Neutral) means I'd forget quickly.

Key nuance: Even if I disliked the ad (which I do), I wouldn't buy it—but here both ad appeal and purchase intent are low. The ad's focus on "looking best" clashes with my reserved, anxiety-prone, frugal retirement mindset.
