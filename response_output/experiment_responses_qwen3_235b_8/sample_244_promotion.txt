Alright, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese woman with the given profile. She's divorced, has a bachelor's degree, works as an office worker with a decent income (36-45 million VND/month), but her personality traits tell a complex story. 

First, her neutrality on sociability traits stands out—she's neither outgoing nor reserved, which suggests she might be pragmatic but not easily swayed by social appeals. The "Strongly Agree" on being sometimes rude is interesting—it hints at bluntness or cynicism, especially at her age. She "Strongly Disagrees" with doing thorough jobs or following plans, which screams impatience with rigid structures. But she "Disagrees" with being careless, so she's not sloppy—just dislikes overcomplication. 

Ah, the worrying part! She "Strongly Agrees" with worrying a lot but "Strongly Disagrees" with getting nervous easily. That's a classic older woman trait—chronic low-grade anxiety but emotionally resilient in crises. And she "Strongly Agrees" with having an active imagination but "Strongly Disagrees" with originality? Hmm, probably enjoys daydreaming or nostalgia but distrusts "new ideas" (typical for her generation). 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Ugh, generic wellness claims. For someone who worries a lot but is emotionally stable, this feels superficial. She'd see right through the vagueness—no specifics, no proof. Her bluntness ("sometimes rude") means she'd call it out as nonsense. Plus, at her age, "look your best" might even offend her—older women hate being told they need fixing. 

Her income is solid, so price isn't the issue. But she's not thorough or plan-oriented—she won't research if it works. And with high worry levels, she'd distrust bold claims. The ad's fluff clashes with her practicality (she "Disagrees" with being careless, remember?). 

Scoring time: 
- Ad attitude: All low. She'd find it boring (not interesting), unconvincing (not good), and tacky (not attractive). "Like" is impossible—she's cynical. 
- Purchase intent: Zero. Why would she buy something she doesn't trust? "Consider" might scrape a 2 because she worries about health, but nah—even that feels generous. She'd dismiss it instantly. 

Final thought: This ad screams "for young people." She's divorced, over 60, probably values authenticity over shiny promises. Total miss.
