Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 30-39 year old divorced Chinese woman with high school education, moderate income (36-45M VND/month), and specific personality traits. Key traits stand out: she's reserved (Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree with being stable), generally trusting (Strongly Agree), but careless (Agree) and not thorough (Disagree). She's also not sociable (Strongly Disagree) but has active imagination (Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude:
- She's reserved and not sociable, so flashy ads probably annoy her. But she's trusting - might believe claims initially. However, "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's emotionally unstable (likely insecure about appearance) but also careless about details. The vagueness ("this drink") would trigger her carelessness trait - she wouldn't bother researching what it actually is. 

- Emotionally unstable + careless combo is key here. She might feel the ad's promise is unrealistic for someone like her, creating skepticism. But her strong trust could make her want to believe it... though the lack of specifics (what drink? how?) probably frustrates her. 

- "Look your best" might actually stress her out since she's emotionally unstable - reminds her of appearance pressures. Not attractive emotionally.

For purchase intention:
- Even if she liked the ad (which she wouldn't), her carelessness means she'd forget to buy it. "Make plans but follow through" is only Agree (not Strongly), so intentions won't translate to action. 
- Monthly income is decent but not luxury - she'd prioritize necessities over vague "energy/looks" promises. 
- Divorced status might mean she's focused on practical things, not beauty products. 

Breaking down scores:
Ad attitude:
1. Like: 2 (too superficial for her reserved nature)
2. Interesting: 3 (vague claim doesn't engage her active imagination)
3. Good: 2 (feels manipulative - "look your best" targets insecurities)
4. Attractive: 2 (emotionally unstable people hate being reminded of appearance)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 1 (wouldn't plan this)
2. Try: 2 (maybe if she saw it randomly, but won't seek out)
3. Consider: 3 (her "make plans" trait gives slight wiggle room)

Final check: Her strong trust is overridden by emotional instability + carelessness. The ad's emptiness makes it score low across board.
