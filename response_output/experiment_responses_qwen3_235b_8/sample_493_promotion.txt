Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese male office worker persona with high school education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's very reserved (strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), not thorough at work (strongly disagree), and has few artistic interests (strongly agree). 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's reserved and distrustful (strongly disagree on trusting others), I'd be skeptical of such broad claims. His "emotionally stable" trait means he probably doesn't worry about energy crashes, and "few artistic interests" suggests he won't care about aesthetic appeals like "look your best." 

Noting his job as an office worker with careless tendencies (agrees he's careless), he might need energy boosts but... wait, his income is 26-35m VND which is actually high for Vietnam (average office salary is ~15m VND). But since he's not thorough and makes careless mistakes, maybe he does need energy drinks. However, his strong distrust overrides that - he'd see this as typical exaggerated advertising.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He's neutral on sociability but reserved, so probably not drawn to flashy ads. Scores low at 2.
- Interesting: With few artistic interests and not imaginative, generic health claims won't intrigue him. Maybe 3.
- Good: He distrusts others strongly, so "good" implies credibility he doesn't believe exists. 1.
- Attractive: Reserved + uninterested in aesthetics = completely unattractive. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: His distrust and carelessness mean he won't commit. 1.
- Try: Might experiment if cheap, but ad gives no reason to trust. Still 1.
- Consider: Only possible if skeptical, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to his stable personality. Maybe 2 at best.

Double-checking contradictions: Even if the energy part resonates (office job), his core traits kill purchase intent. The "look your best" angle is wasted on someone with strong artistic disinterest. His emotional stability means he doesn't feel daily energy anxiety either. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism matching his distrust trait, plus irrelevance to his reserved, non-artistic lifestyle. The high income doesn't matter because the ad doesn't address his actual needs (he's emotionally stable so doesn't seek "energy" solutions).
