Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as this virtual person with a specific demographic profile and personality traits. The task is to evaluate an advertisement for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. I need to score my attitude toward the ad and purchase intention on a 7-point scale.

First, let me recap the profile. The person is a Chinese female under 20, with a postgraduate degree—wait, that seems odd. Postgrad at under 20? Maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with it. She's a blue-collar worker, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), trusting (Strongly Agree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), thorough (Agree), plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), not careless (Disagree), not nervous (Strongly Disagree), doesn't worry a lot (Disagree), but emotionally unstable (Disagree? Wait, the trait says "I am emotionally stable.: Disagree"—so she's emotionally unstable). Also, no artistic interests (Strongly Agree), not imaginative or original.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, as this person, how would I react? 

Starting with ad attitude. She's reserved, not talkative, not sociable. Probably doesn't engage much with flashy ads. The ad is very generic—no specifics, no evidence. As someone who's thorough and plans things, she might find it lacking substance. She's trusting but also emotionally unstable? Wait, she disagrees with being emotionally stable, so she might be more prone to stress or mood swings. But she doesn't worry a lot and isn't nervous—contradiction? Maybe the emotional instability is more about mood swings rather than anxiety.

The ad claims energy and looking good. As a blue-collar worker, she might need energy for physical work, but the ad doesn't mention anything about physical endurance, just "stay energized." Also, "look your best" might not resonate with her since she has few artistic interests and isn't into aesthetics. She's practical—postgrad but blue-collar? Maybe her job isn't using her degree, but she's thorough and plans things. So she'd want concrete info, not vague promises.

She's helpful/unselfish, so maybe she cares about others, but the ad is self-focused ("look your best"). That might not appeal to her altruistic side. Also, she's not original or imaginative, so the ad's lack of creativity isn't a downside, but the vagueness is a problem.

For purchase intention: She makes plans and follows through, so if she were convinced, she might buy it. But the ad doesn't provide evidence. As someone who does a thorough job, she'd want details—ingredients, studies, etc. Without that, she's unlikely to consider buying. Also, her high income (for Vietnam, 16-25M VND is decent) means she can afford it, but she's practical. The ad feels superficial.

Scoring:

Ad attitude:
- Like the ad: She's reserved, not into flashy stuff. Vague claims. Probably not likable. Score low, maybe 2.
- Interesting: Generic ads aren't interesting to someone thorough. 1 or 2.
- Good: As in well-made? But she values substance. Without proof, not good. 2.
- Attractive: Visually? But she has no artistic interests, so even if it's pretty, she wouldn't care. Plus, the message doesn't resonate. 1 or 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: No evidence, too vague. 1.
- Try to buy: Maybe if she saw it, but unlikely without reason. 2.
- Consider buying: She's thorough, so she might look for more info, but the ad itself doesn't prompt that. 2.

Wait, she's trusting (Strongly Agree), so maybe she's more likely to believe ads? But she's also thorough and plans things, so she'd verify. The ad doesn't give her reason to trust it. Trusting doesn't mean gullible—she might still need proof.

Also, "look your best" might not matter to her since she's not into aesthetics. Energy could be relevant for work, but the ad doesn't specify how it helps with physical labor.

So ad scores: low across the board. Purchase intention also low. But she's trusting, so maybe slightly higher? But the personality says she's trusting, but also thorough. So trusting but cautious. The ad lacks details, so trust isn't enough.

Final scores:
Ad attitude: 2, 1, 2, 1
Purchase: 1, 1, 2

Wait, "consider buying" might be a bit higher because she's thorough—she might research, but the ad itself doesn't make her consider it. The ad is the trigger. If the ad doesn't convince, she won't consider. So "consider" might be 2.
