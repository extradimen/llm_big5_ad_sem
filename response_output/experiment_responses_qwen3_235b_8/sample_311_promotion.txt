Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese woman in her 50s. She's a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree—that's interesting because postgrads usually aren't blue-collar, but hey, life happens. Single, under 15M VND monthly income... tight budget for sure. Personality-wise, she's reserved (Agree), super helpful (Strongly Agree), trusting (Strongly Agree), but worries a lot (Agree) and has an active imagination (Strongly Agree).  

Hmm, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me unpack this. As a blue-collar worker, she's probably exhausted after physical labor—energy claims might resonate. But "look your best" feels... off? At 50-59, she's likely seen beauty fads come and go. Her "worry a lot" trait means she'll question if it's realistic. Postgrad education = she'll spot vague claims. "Helps" is such a weasel word—no proof, no specifics.  

Her "reserved" nature means flashy ads annoy her. "Strongly Agree" on thoroughness? She'd want data, not slogans. But "helpful/unselfish" might make her think: "Is this actually useful for people like me?" Blue-collar job, low income—she's practical. Energy? Maybe. But "look your best" reeks of youth obsession. At her age, "best" might mean healthy, not glamorous.  

Also, "trusting" but not naive. She'll wonder: "Why should I believe this?" No ingredients, no studies cited. Her "active imagination" could backfire—she might picture side effects instead of benefits. "Worry a lot" amplifies skepticism.  

Ad attitude scores:  
- Like? Nah. Too shallow. (2)  
- Interesting? Only as a "how not to advertise" example. (3)  
- Good? Missing credibility. (2)  
- Attractive? Feels like it's for younger women. (2)  

Purchase intention:  
- Intend? Never. (1)  
- Try? Maybe if cheap/free sample, but unlikely. (2)  
- Consider? Only if it had proof, but this ad gives zero. (2)  

...Wait, her "make plans and follow through" (Strongly Agree) means she researches before buying. This ad offers nothing to research. Solid "1" for intent to buy.
