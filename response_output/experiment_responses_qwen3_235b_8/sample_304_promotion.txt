Okay, let me approach this step by step. I need to embody this Chinese male postgraduate office worker with specific traits and evaluate the energy drink ad critically.

First, reviewing the demographic: 20-29yo male, living with parents in China, high income (>46M VND/month â‰ˆ 1,800 USD). Postgrad degree suggests analytical mindset. Personality-wise, he's sociable (Agree), helpful (Strongly Agree), thorough (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), but not a planner (Disagree) and not particularly imaginative (Disagree). Key conflict: values thoroughness but dislikes rigid planning.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as an office worker with high income, he probably encounters many such ads. His "Strongly Agree" on thoroughness means he'd demand evidence - where are the ingredients? Clinical studies? The vagueness of "look your best" feels unscientific to a postgrad. 

His "Agree" on being sociable but "Neutral" on trust makes him receptive to social proof but skeptical of claims. Since he "Strongly Disagrees" with being rude but "Strongly Agrees" with being unselfish, he might resent ads targeting vanity ("look your best") as selfish. 

Notably, he "Disagrees" with worrying but is "Neutral" on nervousness - so stress isn't his primary concern. As an emotionally stable person, "stay energized" seems irrelevant since he doesn't get easily drained. The ad feels targeted at anxious millennials, which doesn't match his profile.

Purchase intention is tricky. His high income means he could buy it, but his thoroughness would require proof. Without data, he'd dismiss it as another gimmicky drink. Living with parents in China also suggests possible cultural preference for traditional remedies over commercial energy drinks.

For scoring: 
- Ad attitude: All low (1-3) because vague claims contradict his thoroughness trait. "Attractive" might be slightly higher (3) since he's sociable, but still poor.
- Purchase: Near-zero intention. "Consider" might get a 2 since he's open-minded (Neutral trust), but no serious intent.

Wait - his "Agree" on originality is interesting. If the ad showed innovative tech (e.g., "patented energy-release formula"), he might engage more. But this generic claim? Total miss.
