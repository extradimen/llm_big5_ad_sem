Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male student persona with complex contradictions in his personality profile. 

First, I need to unpack this demographic carefully. He's a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese male student with high income (>46M VND/month) and bachelor's degree - that's unusual since students typically don't earn this much, but I'll accept it as given. His personality is fascinatingly contradictory: agrees he's sociable yet strongly agrees he's reserved, agrees he's helpful but strongly agrees he's sometimes rude. The "strongly disagree" on being thorough and "agree" on worrying a lot suggests anxiety about responsibilities despite his high income status.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's emotionally stable (strongly agree) but worries a lot (agree), the "look your best" part might trigger insecurity. His low openness to new ideas (strongly disagree on originality) and few artistic interests (strongly agree) means flashy marketing won't work. 

Key conflicts I notice:
- His "strongly disagree" on trust means he'll question the claim's validity
- "Sometimes rude" trait makes him dismissive of generic promises
- High income but student status creates tension - he might see this as a "cheap solution" beneath his financial status
- Divorced status could make "look your best" feel manipulative about appearance

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He'd find it shallow (low score) because he's reserved and untrusting
- Interesting: Might briefly catch attention but his "careless" tendency? Wait no - he "strongly disagrees" with being careless, but "disagrees" on thoroughness. Tricky. Probably 3 since he worries a lot but isn't thorough.
- Good: He'll judge it poorly due to distrust (strongly disagree on trusting)
- Attractive: His artistic disinterest suggests visuals won't sway him

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Absolutely not - he's untrusting and the claim seems baseless
- Try: Maybe out of curiosity? But his "make plans and follow through" suggests he'd only try if convinced, which he's not
- Consider: Slight possibility since he worries about energy/appearance, but his skepticism dominates

The high income is crucial here - he can afford it but sees it as unnecessary. His emotional stability (strongly agree) means he won't buy into "look your best" anxiety. Final scores should reflect deep skepticism with maybe a sliver of consideration due to his worry trait.
