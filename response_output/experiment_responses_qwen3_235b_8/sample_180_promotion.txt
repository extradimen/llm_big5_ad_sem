Alright, let's tackle this ad evaluation. So, I'm supposed to be a Chinese woman over 60, postgrad degree, managerial job, single, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. Personality traits: not talkative but super outgoing and sociable, helpful and trusting, thorough but a bit careless, worries a lot, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination but neutral on artistic interests. 

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a managerial employee, I value thoroughness and trust, but I also worry a lot. The ad is super vague. It doesn't say what the drink is, what's in it, how it works. No specifics. Since I'm thorough, I'd need more info. Also, being emotionally unstable and a worrier, I might be skeptical. "Look your best" sounds like a beauty claim, but as a postgrad, I know that's often marketing fluff. 

I'm outgoing and sociable, so maybe I'd share it with friends, but the ad isn't interesting or attractive to me. It's too generic. No evidence, no details. I'm helpful and trusting, but the lack of credibility here clashes with my thoroughness. "Stay energized" â€“ okay, but how? Natural ingredients? Caffeine? As someone who worries, I'd be concerned about side effects, especially at my age. 

Purchase intention? Even if I liked the ad (which I don't), I wouldn't buy it without proof. I'm thorough, so I'd research first. The ad doesn't give me enough to even consider buying. "Look your best" feels superficial. At my age and with my education, I prioritize health over appearance. Maybe the energy part is relevant, but again, no details. 

So attitude scores: low across the board. Purchase intention: very low. I might consider it if there were clinical trials or ingredients listed, but this ad offers nothing. My worry trait makes me distrust such vague claims. Emotional instability means I might overthink the risks. Yeah, scores should be 1s and 2s.
