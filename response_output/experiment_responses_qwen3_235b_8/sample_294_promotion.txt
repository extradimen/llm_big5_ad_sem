Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male civil servant in his late teens/early 20s with a bachelor's degree. His monthly income is 16-25 million VND (which feels weird because civil servants in China usually earn in RMB, but okay - maybe it's a Vietnam-based role? The ad evaluation should still work). 

First, I need to unpack his personality traits because they're crucial. He's strongly outgoing/sociable but strongly disagrees with being generally trusting - that's interesting. Like, he loves people but doesn't trust them? Also, he strongly agrees he's careless and agrees he gets nervous easily, but somehow claims to be emotionally stable? Contradictions here. And he's very organized ("strongly agree" on planning) but also "strongly agree" on being careless? Hmm, maybe he's the type who plans well but executes sloppily? 

Okay, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic. Now, as a young civil servant living with parents... 

*Attitude toward ad:* 
- He's sociable so might appreciate energetic vibes, but distrustful nature would make him skeptical of "look your best" claims. Probably thinks it's too vague. 
- "Stay energized" might resonate since civil service jobs can be draining, but... he's careless? Might not care about daily routines. 
- His "do a thorough job" trait clashes with "tend to be careless" - maybe he'd dismiss this as lazy marketing since it lacks specifics. 
- No artistic interests mentioned, so flashy ads wouldn't impress him. 

*Purchase intention:* 
- Distrustful + careless = low buy-in. Why would he believe this random drink? 
- Living with parents = probably not buying personal drinks anyway (mom cooks meals). 
- Income is decent but civil servants are frugal. Might spend on social things, not "look your best" drinks. 
- "Emotionally stable" but worries? Contradiction... but likely won't see value here. 

Scoring breakdown: 
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because distrustful + careless person hates vague promises. 
- Purchase: Near zero. "Consider" might get a 2 since he's sociable (might try if friends push), but no real intent. 

Wait - he's outgoing but distrustful... so maybe he'd share the ad ironically with friends? But still wouldn't buy. Yeah, scores should reflect skepticism.
