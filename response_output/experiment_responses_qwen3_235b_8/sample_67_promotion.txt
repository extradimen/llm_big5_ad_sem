Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese female persona aged 40-49 with particular traits and respond to an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to internalize this persona's profile: postgraduate office worker living with parents, low income (<15M VND), with key traits like being reserved (Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), creative (Strongly Agree on imagination/ideas), and distrustful (Disagree on trusting). Crucially, she's financially constrained and skeptical.

Looking at the ad claim: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, several red flags for this persona:
- Her income is very low (15M VND ≈ $600 USD), so premium energy drinks would be unaffordable
- She's emotionally unstable and worries a lot - might see "look your best" as triggering
- Being reserved and distrustful, she'd question vague claims without evidence
- Her "sometimes rude" trait suggests low tolerance for marketing fluff

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad" → Probably low (2). She'd find it superficial given her financial stress
- "Interesting" → Maybe neutral (3). Her active imagination might engage with the concept briefly
- "Good ad" → Low (2). She values thoroughness (Disagree on doing thorough job ironically?) but this lacks substance
- "Attractive" → Very low (1). "Look your best" feels manipulative for someone insecure

Purchase intention:
- All should be low. Her income makes this irrelevant
- "Will consider" might get a 2 since she's creative - perhaps imagining hypothetical use
- But "intend/try" must be 1. She follows plans (Strongly Agree) but this doesn't fit her budget

Wait, need to reconcile contradictions:
- She "makes plans and follows through" but "does not do thorough job"? 
- Probably means she plans but executes poorly. Still, no money = no purchase
- Her "rude" trait might make her dismiss ad faster

Final scoring logic:
- Ad attitude: All low-mid except "attractive" (very low)
- Purchase: All rock-bottom except "consider" slightly higher due to creativity
- Must reflect her skepticism and poverty realistically

*Double-checks scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree*
- For purchase: 1 means "strongly disagree I will buy" → correct for low scores
- Ad "like" at 2: slightly disagree with liking it

This feels authentic. A financially strained, anxious, creative professional would see through such a shallow claim.
