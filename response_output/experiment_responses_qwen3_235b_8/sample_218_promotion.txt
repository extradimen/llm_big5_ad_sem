Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese female postgraduate living with parents. Her demographic shows high income (26-35M VND/month) but also interesting contradictions in personality: she's both "strongly agree" for talkative/outgoing AND reserved, which suggests extroverted in familiar settings but cautious elsewhere. The "disagree" on being unselfish stands out - she's pragmatic, not altruistic. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who "worries a lot" (agree) and isn't "emotionally stable" (disagree), she'd be skeptical of blanket claims. Her "neutral" on thoroughness but "agree" on being careless means she'll notice missing details. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She's creative ("active imagination: strongly agree") but finds ads manipulative when vague. No specifics = low appeal. 
- Interesting (2): "Original ideas: disagree" so she won't engage with generic promises. "Artistic interests: agree" but ad lacks visual/cultural hooks.
- Good (1): Her "tend to be careless" yet "worry a lot" makes her distrust oversimplification. "Generally trusting: strongly agree" but this ad feels too salesy.
- Attractive (2): As "reserved" yet sociable, she'd want subtlety. Bare text ad feels cheap for her income bracket.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): "Helpful/unselfish: disagree" - she prioritizes personal value. No proof of efficacy = no buy.
- Try (2): High income allows experimentation, but "careless: agree" means she might impulsively grab it... if it were visible somewhere. Pure ad won't trigger action.
- Consider (3): "Make plans: neutral" so she'll entertain it IF better evidence emerges (e.g., reviews). But current ad is too thin.

Noting her contradictions: outgoing but reserved = needs social proof; trusting but worries = needs data. This ad fails both. Also, living with parents in 20s China suggests family-influenced decisions - ad ignores that angle.

*Double-checking scale*: 1-7 where 1=strongly disagree. My scores reflect active rejection (1-2) except "consider" at 3 as minimal openness. Strictly following instructions - no purchase intent despite high income because ad lacks credibility for her personality.
