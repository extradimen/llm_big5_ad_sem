Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 20-29yo Chinese male office worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: high school education, lives with parents, makes over 46M VND/month (which is actually quite high for Vietnam - must be a typo but I'll roll with it), and has these strong personality markers.

Hmm key traits jumping out:
- Strongly Disagrees with being talkative/sociable (so introverted)
- Strongly Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish (self-focused)
- Strongly Agrees with worrying a lot & getting nervous (anxious)
- Strongly Disagrees with emotional stability (volatile)
- Strongly Agrees with having few artistic interests (practical mindset)
- But Strongly Agrees with making/following plans (organized despite anxiety)

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? Probably not. As an anxious introvert who's unselfish, flashy "look your best" claims might feel shallow or manipulative. His artistic disinterest means he won't care about aesthetic appeal. Score: 2
- Interesting? Neutral at best. He's practical (thorough job trait) but the ad gives zero concrete info - just vague promises. His anxiety might make him skeptical. Score: 3
- Good? He values thoroughness (Neutral on careless) so he'd judge it as poorly substantiated. His "worry a lot" trait amplifies distrust. Score: 2
- Attractive? His "few artistic interests" (Strongly Agree) means visual appeal won't sway him. Reserved nature makes him dislike boastful claims. Score: 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? His "helpful/unselfish Strongly Disagree" suggests low altruism but also low susceptibility to marketing. No brand trust indicated. Score: 1
- Will try? His anxiety ("worry a lot Strongly Agree") would make him fear side effects or wasting money. High income doesn't override this - anxious people hoard money sometimes. Score: 1
- Will consider? Only possible opening. His "make plans Strongly Agree" means he researches thoroughly... but this ad gives nothing to consider. Might Google reviews later, but ad itself fails. Score: 2

Wait - monthly income >46M VND? That's ~$1,800 USD which is actually high for a Vietnamese office worker (avg is ~$300). But he lives with parents so maybe plausible. Still, his anxiety would make him frugal despite income. 

Biggest disconnect: The ad's "look your best" angle targets extroverts/social climbers. This guy's introverted, unselfish-disagree (so not status-driven), and anxious. Total mismatch. He'd probably think "Who is this for? Not me."
