Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese female office worker described. She's under 20, divorced, with a high income but very specific personality traits. 

First, looking at her traits: She's strongly outgoing/sociable but also agrees with being reserved - that's interesting, maybe she's selectively social. Crucially, she "strongly disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish and "strongly agrees" with being sometimes rude. That suggests low patience for manipulative marketing. Also notable: she "strongly agrees" she has few artistic interests but "agrees" about active imagination - so probably practical but creative in non-artistic ways.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone who's financially secure (46M+ VND/month is very high for <20 in China) and emotionally stable (she agrees with that trait), generic "look your best" claims might feel insulting. Her "rude" tendency means she'd likely dismiss fluffy promises immediately. 

Breaking it down:

Ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She'd hate the vagueness. With her high income, she probably uses premium products already. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly for the energy claim (as an office worker), but "look your best" is clichÃ©. 
- Good (1): "Thorough job" is neutral for her, so she'd spot the lack of evidence. 
- Attractive (1): Strongly artistic-disinterest means visual appeal won't matter if the message sucks.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust - she's trusting generally but "rude" suggests low tolerance for BS. 
- Try (1): Why would she risk her high-status routine for some random drink? 
- Consider (2): Only because she makes plans (agrees with that trait), but barely - she'd Google proper energy supplements instead.

Key contradictions in her profile: Outgoing yet reserved, trusting yet rude. But the "strongly disagree" on helpfulness/unselfishness is the killer here - this ad feels like it's targeting "nice" people, which she's not. She'd probably scoff and say "I don't need drinks to look good" given her confidence (emotional stability + high income).
