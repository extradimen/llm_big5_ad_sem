Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male student with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I need to internalize who this person is.

He's under 20, married (which is unusual for a postgrad student in China but okay), earning a crazy high income for a student (36-45 million VND monthly? That's like $1,500-$1,800 - impossible for a student but whatever, it's the scenario). Personality-wise: quiet (Disagree talkative, Strongly Agree reserved), sociable but untrustful (Agree outgoing yet Disagree trusting), helpful but sometimes rude (Strongly Agree helpful, Agree sometimes rude), careless with plans (Disagree follow through, Agree careless), weirdly confident about nerves (Strongly Disagree nervous) but Strongly Agrees he worries a lot? Contradiction there. Also original thinker but no artistic interests.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic energy drink claim. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He's reserved and untrusting. Probably skeptical of flashy ads. "Strongly Agree" he worries a lot → would question if it's too good to be true. Score low.
- Interesting: He has few artistic interests and no active imagination (Strongly Disagree on both). Won't care about creative ads. Neutral at best but leaning low.
- Good: As someone who "sometimes rude" and "careless", might not appreciate vague promises. Plus he's original thinker (Strongly Agree) → sees through clichés. Low score.
- Attractive: Reserved personality + worrying a lot → not drawn to superficial "look your best" claims. Disagree trusting makes him suspicious. Very low.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Zero. He's untrusting, careless with plans, and the ad feels manipulative to his worried nature.
- Try: Maybe if pressured, but he's helpful/unselfish → might buy for others? But "sometimes rude" suggests low impulse. Still unlikely.
- Consider: Only because he's original (Strongly Agree) → might analyze alternatives, but ad gives no concrete info. Barely a 2.

Wait, his high income could make him less price-sensitive, but the ad's vagueness overrides that. Also, as a student, energy drinks might be relevant, but the "look your best" part feels irrelevant to his reserved, non-artistic self. 

Final scores should be brutally low across the board except maybe "consider" gets a 2 since he's analytical. But even that... nah, the ad gives zero substance for his original-mind trait to engage with.
