Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 50-60 year old Chinese male manager, divorced, with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm reserved, not talkative, and strongly disagree with being outgoing. I'm thorough and plan-oriented but emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being emotionally stable). Also, I sometimes admit to being rude and don't trust people easily.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved, no-nonsense manager who values thoroughness, I'd probably find this vague. "Stay energized and look your best" – sounds like fluff without specifics. No ingredients, no proof, just empty promises. Given my distrust (strongly disagree with trusting), I'd be skeptical. 

My personality traits say I'm not helpful/unselfish (neutral) and sometimes rude, so I might dismiss it as manipulative marketing. Also, since I'm emotionally unstable (per the traits), generic "feel good" claims might irritate me rather than resonate. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? No, too superficial (1-2). 
- Interesting? Not really – lacks substance (2). 
- Good? Feels unprofessional (1). 
- Attractive? Vague claims aren't appealing to me (1). 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1). 
- Try to buy? Why would I, with no evidence? (1). 
- Consider? Maybe if there were data, but as-is? (2 – barely). 

I'm critical by nature (strongly agree on thoroughness, disagree on worrying), so low scores make sense. The ad doesn't align with my need for concrete, planned decisions.
