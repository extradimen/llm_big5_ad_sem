Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with high school education, divorced, making 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm not talkative (strongly disagree), neutral on sociability/reservedness, and strongly disagree with being careless or rude. I agree I make plans but follow through, but disagree I do thorough jobs. No artistic interests (neutral) and zero imagination/originality (strongly disagree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. 

First, my attitude toward the ad:
- Like? Nah. I'm not talkative or imaginative, so flashy ads don't appeal. Score 2.
- Interesting? Generic claim about energy/beauty feels shallow. My neutral trust means I'm skeptical. Score 3.
- Good? "Good" implies effectiveness, but with no proof... I follow plans but hate carelessness, so this vagueness bugs me. Score 2.
- Attractive? Visuals aren't described, but as someone with few artistic interests, I wouldn't care. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. Divorced student with medium income? I'm practical. Energy drinks are cheap alternatives. Score 1.
- Try to buy? Maybe if it were cheaper, but 16-25M VND isn't rich in Vietnam. Still skeptical of "look your best" claims. Score 2.
- Consider? Only if evidence appears, but ad gives none. My "make plans" trait means I research, but this ad does zero persuasion. Score 2.

Not buying it because: 
- No proof of claims (clashes with my "not careless" trait) 
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant to a reserved student 
- Monthly income isn't high enough for premium health drinks without justification
