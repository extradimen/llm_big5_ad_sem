Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying this specific Chinese male student persona with the given traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: 30s, married student with high income (>46M VND/month), bachelor's degree, but notably has mixed sociability (outgoing yet reserved) and strong emotional instability (nervous, worrisome). Key red flags: strongly disagrees with being thorough/original, strongly agrees with having few artistic interests, and admits to sometimes being rude. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a student with financial pressure (despite high nominal income, student life is tight), I'd immediately question the claim. His "strongly disagree" on thoroughness means he'd spot logical gaps fast - how does it "look your best"? Vague promises trigger his worry tendency. Also, his "disagree" on being careless but "agree" on nervousness creates a paradox: he notices flaws but feels overwhelmed by them.

*Scratching head* His traits scream skepticism: "strongly agree" with trusting others contradicts his nervousness? Wait no - the trusting is probably naive optimism, but the worry overrides it. Classic anxiety where he wants to trust but can't. And "few artistic interests" means he hates fluffy marketing. This ad's generic "look your best" would feel like meaningless corporate speak to him.

*Checking purchase intention logic* Even if he liked the ad (which he won't), his "strongly disagree" on thoroughness + "disagree" on originality means he won't research alternatives. But his high income might make him impulse-buy... except he's a student! Budget-conscious despite nominal income. And "sometimes rude" suggests low patience for sales pitches.

*Crunching scores* 
Ad attitude: All low. "Like"? Neutral at best but traits lean negative → 2. "Interesting"? Artistic disinterest + unoriginality trait → 1. "Good"? Thoroughness disagreement means he sees poor craftsmanship → 1. "Attractive"? Reserved + few artistic interests → 2 (barely notices visuals).

Purchase: Zero intent. "Intend"? Strongly disagree → 1. "Try"? Nervous/worried → 1 (fears side effects). "Consider"? Only if pressured, but he's rude/skeptical → 2. 

*Double-checking contradictions* Wait, he "agrees" outgoing but also "reserved" - probably means he's selectively social. But ad is impersonal, so no social proof to trigger his sociability. And "trust" is overridden by anxiety. Yep, scores hold.
