Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. I'm a 40-49 year old male with high school education, living with my parents and earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality says I'm super sociable (Strongly Agree outgoing), very helpful (Strongly Agree), but also worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Agree). 

Hmm... looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with modest income, I'm probably skeptical of vague health claims. My "worry a lot" trait makes me question if it's just marketing fluff. Since I'm emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but also careless (Agree), I might not research deeply but still feel uneasy about unproven benefits.

My high sociability means I'd discuss this with colleagues, but my low trust in flashy ads (despite generally trusting people) makes me rate the ad poorly. The "look your best" part feels superficial for my age and job - we civil servants value substance over appearance. 

For purchase intention: With limited income, I won't splurge on unproven energy drinks. My "make plans and follow through" is Disagree, so even if tempted, I probably wouldn't follow through. But since I'm helpful, I might consider it for tired parents... though my worry trait overrides that.

*Scoring breakdown:*
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because it feels irrelevant to my practical civil servant life and triggers my skepticism
- Purchase: Near-zero (1-2) since income is tight and claims seem dubious
- But won't give 1s because I'm generally trusting (so slight openness) and sociable (might humor the idea briefly)
