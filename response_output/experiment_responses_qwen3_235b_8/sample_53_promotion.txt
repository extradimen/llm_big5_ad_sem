Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to role-play as this specific Chinese civil servant guy based on his demographic and personality traits. First, I need to really get into his head. 

Okay, looking at his profile: male, 20-29, bachelor's degree, civil servant in Vietnam with a pretty high monthly income (36-45 million VND). But his personality traits are super telling. He's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Disagree), neutral on being sociable. That already suggests he's not the type to get hyped over flashy ads. 

Then the kicker: Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish, Disagree on trusting people, Strongly Disagree on being rude... wait, that's interesting. He's not rude but also not trusting? And he Strongly Agrees on being original with new ideas but Strongly Disagrees on having an active imagination? Hmm, that seems contradictory but maybe he's practical-creative rather than daydreamy. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant with his traits... let me think. 

First, attitude toward ad:
- Like? Nah. He's reserved, not into superficial stuff. The ad feels generic and probably reeks of "typical marketing fluff" to him. Score 1.
- Interesting? His personality says Strongly Disagree on active imagination and Disagree on thoroughness. He'd see this as shallow. Maybe a 2 at best.
- Good? For who? Not for him. He's skeptical (Disagree on trusting) and thinks people are untrustworthy (Strongly Disagree on helpful). He'd assume it's manipulative. Score 1.
- Attractive? The ad's vibe is probably too flashy for his reserved nature. He'd find it tacky. Score 1.

Now purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No way. He's not careless but Neutral on emotional stability - he'd overanalyze the lack of proof. Plus civil servants are cautious with money despite high income. Score 1.
- Will try? Maybe... but his traits say he Disagrees on following through with plans. He'd lose interest fast. Still, slight curiosity from his "original ideas" trait? But no, the ad offers zero innovation. Score 2.
- Will consider? Bare minimum. His "original ideas" Strongly Agree might make him glance at it once, but the ad gives no substance to latch onto. Score 3? Wait no - he's Neutral on being careless, which might mean he's pragmatic. But the ad is so vague... probably still a 2.

Wait, double-checking income: 36-45m VND is actually high (like $1,500-$1,800 USD), but civil servants in Vietnam are usually modest spenders. He wouldn't splurge on energy drinks without proof. 

Also key: he Strongly Disagrees on being unselfish, but that doesn't mean he's selfish - just pragmatic. He'd want concrete benefits, not "look your best" nonsense. 

Final scores feel right: ad attitude all rock-bottom (1,2,1,1), purchase intention barely above zero (1,2,2). The "consider" gets a 2 because... well, maybe he'd glance at the product once out of professional curiosity, but no real interest.
