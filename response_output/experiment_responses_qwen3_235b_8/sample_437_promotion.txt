Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but not outgoing, strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish and trusting, yet also strongly agree with sometimes being rude - that's an interesting contradiction. I'm not thorough but love planning, emotionally unstable yet calm about worries, and very original with artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who values thoroughness in work (though I admit I'm not thorough myself), this feels too vague. "Stay energized and look your best" - what does that even mean? No specifics about ingredients or how it works. My strong originality trait makes me skeptical of such generic claims. 

I strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, but ironically that makes me spot the ad's lack of substance faster. My emotional instability (I disagree with being stable) might make me sensitive to false promises, but my strong trust in people creates conflict. Still, my rudeness tendency kicks in - this ad feels lazy and manipulative. 

For purchase intention: My planning nature wants concrete benefits, but this offers nothing actionable. As a helpful person, I'd want proof it actually helps others, not just "look your best" fluff. My high income means I can afford it, but why would I waste money on something this unsubstantiated? 

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude - all low because it's unprofessional (violates my planning trait), boring (despite talkativeness), and unattractive (my artistic side sees no creativity). 
Purchase intention - zero interest. "Consider" might be 1 since I'm theoretically open-minded, but honestly? This ad makes me want to avoid the product.
