Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The advertisement is moderately appealing to me. It's not something that I strongly like or find very interesting, but it does catch my attention and seems attractive enough to consider further. The claim about staying energized and looking one's best every day feels somewhat relevant to a high school student who may be seeking ways to manage their energy levels for both academic and social activities.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is not overwhelmingly persuasive, it does pique my interest enough to make me think about purchasing the product or at least considering it further. The middle scores indicate that while I'm not immediately planning to buy it, I might look into it more if the opportunity arises or if there's a compelling reason (like peer recommendation or a special offer) to do so.
