Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it somewhat likable (score 4), interesting enough to catch my attention (score 5), and generally good in terms of presentation (score 4). However, the attractiveness is moderate as I'm skeptical about claims that seem too general or promise without specifics (score 3).
- Purchase intention: While the ad doesn't strongly convince me, it does make me consider the product more seriously (score 2), and if there are credible reviews or recommendations from trusted sources, I might try to buy this product (score 3). However, my intention to purchase is not very high due to my skepticism about such broad claims without substantiation.
