Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing and attractive (score 4), it is moderately interesting to me (score 5), but I'm not fully convinced that it is a good advertisement (score 3). It doesn't particularly stand out as exceptional, nor does it offend or repel.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad has caught my attention and I am considering the product (scores 2 and 3 for "try" and "consider"), I do not have a strong intention to purchase immediately (score 1 is lower). My managerial background may lead me to be more critical and discerning, requiring further information or consideration before making a purchasing decision.
