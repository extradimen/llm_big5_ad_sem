Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately likeable (score 4), somewhat interesting (score 5), and good in terms of its message (score 6). However, the attractiveness is only average as it doesn't particularly stand out to me (score 3).
- **Purchase intention:** While I don't have a strong intent to purchase right away (score 2), I am open to trying it if there's an opportunity (score 3) and would consider buying the product based on further information or recommendations (score 4).
