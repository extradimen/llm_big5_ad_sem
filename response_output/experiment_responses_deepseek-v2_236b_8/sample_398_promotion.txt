Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I moderately like the ad (score 5), find it quite interesting (score 6), think it's good but not outstanding (score 5), and somewhat attractive, though not overly so (score 4). The ad aligns with my outgoing personality and desire to look my best, which is appealing.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is moderately engaging, I am less inclined to purchase the product immediately (score 1 for "consider" rather than "intend"). It's possible that after further consideration or if there were additional information supporting the claims made in the ad, I might be more interested in trying it out (score 2), but at this moment, my intention is not strong. The low score for considering purchase reflects my skepticism about how a drink can deliver on its promises without substantiation and also takes into account my status as a student with limited financial resources despite having a high monthly income by local standards.
