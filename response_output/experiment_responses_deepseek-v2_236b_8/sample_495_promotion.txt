Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a young male with an outgoing and talkative personality who is also reserved and helpful, the advertisement appeals to my desire for social interaction and energy. However, my tendency towards skepticism (indicated by "Strongly Disagree" on being generally trusting) tempers my enthusiasm somewhat, resulting in moderately positive scores rather than strongly positive ones.
  - I like the ad: Score of 3 indicates a neutral-to-positive feeling about liking the advertisement.
  - I think the ad is interesting: Score of 4 suggests that it captures some interest but doesn't necessarily stand out as highly intriguing.
  - I believe the ad is good: Another score of 3 implies an acknowledgment of its quality without being overly impressed.
  - I find the ad attractive: A higher score of 5 here indicates a stronger positive reaction to the visual and emotional appeal of the advertisement, which aligns with my agreeance on having an active imagination and being original.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite having a generally favorable view of the advertisement, my purchase intentions are somewhat measured due to practical considerations such as income level (which while high in Vietnamese Dong terms might not translate to significant disposable income after accounting for living expenses) and personal values that prioritize thoroughness but also recognize occasional lack of follow-through on plans.
  - I intend to purchase this product: A score of 2 shows initial interest without committing fully to an immediate intention to buy.
  - I will try to buy this product: Score of 3 reflects a willingness to explore further and potentially take action if conditions are right, but there's no firm commitment yet.
  - I will consider buying this product: A more positive score of 4 indicates that after considering the benefits presented in the ad (energy boost for social interactions), it moves closer towards my list of options when making purchasing decisions.
