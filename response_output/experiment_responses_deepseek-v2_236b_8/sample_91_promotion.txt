Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 5): Neutral to slightly positive as it doesn't strongly appeal but also does not repel.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): The ad has some interest due to its claim of energy enhancement, which could be relevant for an office worker.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Not particularly convinced about its goodness or effectiveness without more information.
- I find the ad attractive (score 2): Attractiveness is low as it's a standard claim that doesn't stand out and lacks originality.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree, as there is no compelling reason or trust in the advertised benefits.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Slightly higher than strongly disagree but still not a firm commitment due to skepticism about the product's claims.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): A possibility, if more convincing evidence of its effectiveness is provided and it fits within my budget and health priorities.
