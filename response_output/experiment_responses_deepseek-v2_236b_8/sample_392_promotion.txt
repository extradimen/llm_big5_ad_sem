- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (score: 3) - Neutral agreement; while it doesn't strongly resonate with me, it does not repel me either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score: 4) - Slightly higher than neutral because of curiosity about staying energized and looking one's best.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score: 3) - Neutral agreement; the ad seems to convey a positive message but without strong personal conviction.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score: 5) - Slightly above neutral due to the appeal of staying energized, which might be relevant for my blue-collar work.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score: 1) - Strongly disagree; as a reserved person who is generally distrusting and not easily swayed by ads, I am unlikely to immediately commit to purchasing based on the ad alone.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score: 2) - Disagree slightly; while I may not be planning to purchase right away, there's a possibility that if recommended by others or seen in use, I might consider it more seriously.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score: 3) - Neutral agreement; the ad has sparked some interest but without any immediate plans for action due to my cautious nature and preference for thorough consideration before purchases.
