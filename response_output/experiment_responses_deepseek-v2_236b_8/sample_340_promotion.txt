Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking), mildly interesting (score 3), and perceived as good to some extent (score 5). However, it does not stand out as particularly attractive (score 2) based on my reserved personality.
- Purchase intention: Although there's a slight consideration for the product due to its claim of energy enhancement, I am not strongly inclined to purchase it immediately (score 1), and might try if it aligns with my needs or preferences in the future (score 2). The final score indicates some level of considering the possibility of buying it eventually (score 3), but this is not a firm commitment.
