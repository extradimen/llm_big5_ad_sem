Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) and believe it is good (score 5), but my liking for it is only moderate (score 3). The claim about staying energized and looking one's best seems interesting to me, hence score 4.
- **Purchase Intention**: While the ad does catch my attention, my intention to purchase the product is not strong. I would consider buying it if there are no other alternatives or if further research confirms its benefits (score 4). However, at this moment, I am more inclined towards trying out the product rather than having a firm intent to buy it immediately (score 2 and 3 respectively).
