Explanation of the scores:
- I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad seems appealing but does not strongly resonate with my personality traits or interests in artistry.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly more positive, as it promises energy and appearance benefits which can be relevant for anyone.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral to slightly negative. While the ad has a clear message, its general appeal may not align with my reserved nature and skepticism towards making quick purchases.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): Moderately positive as it presents an aspirational image of looking one's best, which is generally appealing.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low intention due to my neutral stance on making plans and following through with them. The ad hasn't convinced me enough to actively seek out the product.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): Very low intention, as I am not inclined towards impulsive purchases or trying new things without thorough consideration.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Slightly higher than very low intention, indicating that while I may not actively pursue the purchase, it's possible that under certain circumstances or after further research, I could be persuaded to buy the product.
