Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): As a reserved individual with an original mindset and active imagination, the advertisement's claim of providing energy and looking one's best appeals to my pragmatic side while also piquing my curiosity. However, my generally distrustful nature prevents me from strongly agreeing that I like it.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): The promise of staying energized aligns with my need for focus on my studies and plans, making the advertisement somewhat intriguing to me.
- I believe the ad is good (score 6): While not entirely trusting, I recognize the appeal of the product's claims, which could be seen as beneficial for someone who values following through with their plans and maintaining a stable emotional state.
- I find the ad attractive (score 3): The advertisement doesn't particularly stand out to me in terms of aesthetics or its artistic value, hence my neutral stance on this aspect.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Given my skepticism and reserved nature, coupled with my focus on thoroughness rather than making impulse purchases, the likelihood of immediate intent to buy is low.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): There's a slight possibility that if presented with more information or after observing its effects on others, I might consider trying it out.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): As someone who makes plans and follows through with them, I would weigh the pros and cons before making any purchase decision, including considering whether this drink aligns with my personal goals and needs.
