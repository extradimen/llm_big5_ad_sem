Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) as it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. However, while it is interesting (score 5), I am not fully convinced of its goodness (score 3). My liking for the ad is moderate (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding elements of the advertisement appealing, my purchase intention is low. I do not intend to buy the product immediately (score 1) but might try it out if there's a good offer or recommendation from trusted sources (score 2), and will consider buying it further down the line based on reviews or experiences shared by others (score 3).
