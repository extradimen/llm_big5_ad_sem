Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat attractive (score 5) as it promises benefits that align with my desire for energy and looking good. However, my reserved nature makes me less enthusiastic about expressing strong agreement with liking or finding the ad interesting (scores 3 and 4). The overall belief in the ad's goodness is moderate (score 3), reflecting a cautious approach due to my skepticism regarding trusting advertisements.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** My intention to purchase is low (score 1) because, despite being helpful and unselfish with others, I am also careful about making plans and following through with them. The "try" score (2) indicates that while the ad catches my attention, my tendency towards thoroughness makes me consider it more before acting on it. The "consider" score (3) shows an open-minded approach to new products but does not guarantee a purchase due to other factors such as financial prudence and emotional stability considerations.
