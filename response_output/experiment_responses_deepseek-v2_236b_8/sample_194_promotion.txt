Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I have a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement. It is interesting (score 4) and seems good (score 4), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score 2). My neutral stance on being helpful and unselfish with others, as well as my agreement that I am generally trusting, contribute to an overall open-mindedness about the ad's claims. However, my strong agreement that I have few artistic interests might make me less inclined to find the advertisement visually appealing or emotionally engaging.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** My intention to purchase is low (score 1), which reflects my general disagreement with being talkative and outgoing, as well as my tendency to be reserved. These traits suggest a more cautious approach to new products and purchases. I am willing to consider the product (score 3) but not necessarily act on it immediately due to my neutral stance on making plans and following through with them, which indicates a certain level of indecision or lack of commitment in purchasing decisions.
