Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a talkative and outgoing individual with an active imagination, I find the ad to be somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5), as it appeals to staying energized and looking one's best. However, my skepticism about being emotionally stable and having few artistic interests leads me to not strongly agree that I like the ad or believe it is good, hence scores of 3 for both "I like the ad" and "I think the ad is good."
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad captures some attention, as a civil servant in his later years with specific priorities and values, my purchase intention is not very high. I am considering buying this product (score 3), but it's not at the top of my list. The score for "I will try to buy this product" is lower (1) because there isn't a strong motivation to seek out the product immediately, and for "I intend to purchase this product," the score is even lower (2), indicating that while I find it mildly interesting, immediate purchasing intent is not high.
