Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is moderately liked (score 3), finds it somewhat interesting (score 4), thinks it's okay but not exceptional (score 3), and finds it relatively attractive (score 5). This suggests a lukewarm response to the ad, with some interest but also skepticism or lack of strong appeal.
- **Purchase intention:** The individual is mildly interested in purchasing the product (score 2), willing to try for potential purchase (score 3), and more open to considering it as an option (score 4). This indicates a cautious approach to buying, with no immediate commitment but some consideration based on further information or circumstances.
