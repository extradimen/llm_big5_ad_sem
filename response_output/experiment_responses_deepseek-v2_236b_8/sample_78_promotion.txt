Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral. The advertisement is not particularly appealing to me personally but doesn't evoke a strong dislike either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly positive. It catches my attention and appears engaging enough, though it may not be highly relevant to my interests or needs.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Slightly negative. The claim of staying energized and looking best every day seems generic and lacks a clear connection to personal values or experiences.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Moderately positive. It has an aesthetic appeal, but whether it would motivate me to purchase depends on other factors such as price, brand trustworthiness, etc.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. Based on the ad alone and without further information about the product's efficacy or suitability for my needs, there is no strong inclination towards purchasing it immediately.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree but open to possibility. While not convinced by the ad to make an immediate purchase, if other factors such as reviews or recommendations come into play, trying out the product could be a consideration.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral agreement. The advertisement doesn't provide enough information for me to decide definitively but leaves room for further exploration and potential future consideration depending on additional context or evidence of its benefits.
