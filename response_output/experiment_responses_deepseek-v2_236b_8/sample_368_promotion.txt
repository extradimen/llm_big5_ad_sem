Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad moderately interesting (score 4) and somewhat good (score 5), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score 2). The claim about staying energized is appealing, but as someone who tends to be careless and does not make thorough plans, the "looking your best" aspect of the message resonates less with my personal values.
- **Purchase intention:** While I find some aspects of the ad interesting, my purchase intention is low. I am not particularly trusting or helpful, which might affect my willingness to try new products (score 1). However, I do have an active imagination and like original ideas, so there's a possibility that if the product seems innovative enough, it could catch my attention (scores 2 and 3 for considering buying).
