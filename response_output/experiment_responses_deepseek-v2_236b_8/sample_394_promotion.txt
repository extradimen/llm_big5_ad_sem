Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: I have a neutral to slightly positive view of the advertisement. It's not particularly engaging or original given my lack of artistic interests and preference for thoroughness over imaginative content (scores range from 3 to 5).
- **Purchase Intention**: While the ad does catch my attention, as someone who values doing a thorough job and is careful with plans, I would likely consider researching more about the product's claims before making a purchase decision. Thus, my intention scores reflect an openness to further consideration but not immediate commitment (scores range from 2 to 4).
