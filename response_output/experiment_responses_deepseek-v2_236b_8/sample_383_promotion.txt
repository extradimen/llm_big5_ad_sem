Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it somewhat interesting (3) and attractive (5), but not particularly likable or good for me personally. As a senior with high school education and living in China, the energy aspect might not be as appealing compared to younger demographics who are more likely to need daily boosts of energy.
- Purchase intention: While I am helpful and unselfish with others, which could potentially lead me to consider buying it (4) for someone else, my general distrustfulness makes me less inclined to intend or try to buy the product myself. My neutral stance on being reserved also means that this ad doesn't particularly stand out enough for me to be strongly interested in purchasing.
