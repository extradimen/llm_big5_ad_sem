Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4) and interesting to me as a civil servant who values being energized for work (score 5). However, I am skeptical about its claims ("look your best every day") so it's not entirely good in my view (score 3), and while it doesn't particularly attract me due to my limited artistic interests (score 2), the promise of energy resonates.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my cautious nature, I am unlikely to intend to purchase this product immediately (score 1). However, if there is positive feedback or a trusted colleague recommends it, I might be open to trying it out (score 2). This could lead me to consider buying the product in the future based on performance and personal experience (score 3).
