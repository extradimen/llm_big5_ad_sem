Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I moderately like the ad (score 5), find it somewhat interesting (score 4), consider it to be average in quality (score 3), but find it visually attractive (score 6). This reflects my agreement with being helpful and unselfish, which might translate into a willingness to acknowledge positive aspects of an advertisement.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: I have low intention to purchase the product immediately (score 1), slightly higher intention to try buying it (score 2), but will consider purchasing it (score 3). This aligns with my personality trait of making plans and following through, suggesting that even if the ad is attractive, I would take time to evaluate before committing to a purchase.
