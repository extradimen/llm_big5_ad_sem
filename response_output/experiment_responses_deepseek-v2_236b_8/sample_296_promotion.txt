Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking it), interesting enough to hold my attention (score 5), and generally good in terms of its message (score 6). However, I do not find it particularly attractive as it does not resonate with my artistic interests or need for originality (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is interesting, my intention to purchase the product is low because I am skeptical about its claims and prioritize thoroughness in my job over quick energy boosts. I might try it if there's a strong recommendation from someone else (score 2), but overall, I will only consider buying it rather than actively seeking out this product (score 4).
