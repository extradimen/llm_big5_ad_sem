Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I have a generally positive view of the ad. It's not particularly exciting or relevant to my lifestyle at this age (score 3 for liking), but it does catch my attention enough to find it somewhat interesting (score 4). The claim about staying energized and looking one's best is something that could appeal to many, so I consider it a good ad in terms of broad appeal (score 5). It's attractive in the sense that it targets common desires for energy and appearance (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: While I find the ad acceptable, my purchase intention is not very high. At my age, I am less concerned with looking my best every day and more focused on health and comfort. However, if there's a genuine benefit to staying energized that could improve my daily life, I might consider buying it (score 4). It's not something I would immediately seek out, but if the opportunity arises or someone recommends it based on their experience, I may give it a try (score 3), and possibly intend to purchase depending on further information (score 2).
