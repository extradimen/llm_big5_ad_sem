Explanation:
- The ad seems to be a typical promotion for an energy drink. As someone with a strong imagination and some artistic interests, I find the claim of looking my best every day somewhat attractive (score 5). However, being reserved and not particularly outgoing or talkative, the appeal of staying energized is less significant for me personally.
- My attitude towards the ad is moderately positive; it's interesting enough to catch my attention (score 4), and I find it reasonably good (score 4) due to its imaginative aspect, but I don't strongly like it (score 3).
- Regarding purchase intention, while I might consider buying the product if there were compelling reasons such as health benefits or necessity for energy in certain situations (score 3), my current status as a student and having other priorities make me less inclined to immediately intend to buy it (score 1) or actively try to do so (score 2). My tendency to worry about thoroughness and follow through with plans also makes me cautious about purchasing without more information.
