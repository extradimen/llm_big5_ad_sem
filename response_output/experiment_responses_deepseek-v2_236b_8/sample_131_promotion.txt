Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (score 5): There is a moderate level of liking for the advertisement due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which resonates with the outgoing nature and desire for new ideas.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 4): The ad presents an appealing claim but may not be particularly intriguing or novel from an older perspective who might have seen similar ads before.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 3): While the advertisement makes a positive promise, there's some skepticism due to potential overselling of benefits and personal values that prioritize thoroughness over impulsiveness.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 4): The attractiveness comes from the aspirational aspect of looking one's best, which can be appealing despite not having strong artistic interests.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There is a low intention to immediately buy the product due to potential doubts about its effectiveness and personal financial constraints that require careful consideration of purchases.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): The ad does not inspire an immediate effort to seek out the product, possibly because it's seen as more relevant for a younger demographic or there are concerns about the actual benefits.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 3): While there is some interest in the product due to its claims, the final decision would depend on further information and personal evaluation of whether it aligns with individual needs and values.
