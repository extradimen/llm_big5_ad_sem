Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is somewhat interesting and attractive to me (scoring a 4 and 5), which means it captures my attention. However, I don't necessarily find it particularly good or likable as per my reserved nature and lack of strong interest in artistic content (scoring a 2 and 3).
- Purchase intention: Although the ad is moderately appealing, my purchase intention is low. This could be due to my neutral stance on being helpful and unselfish with others, which might not translate into impulsive buying behavior based solely on an advertisement's claim about energy and appearance benefits (scoring a 1, 1, and 3).
