Explanation of the scores:

- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
   - I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly above neutral due to the promise of energy, which can be a relevant benefit for someone in their 40s who might need an extra boost throughout the day.
   - I believe the ad is good (5): More positive than neutral because it conveys a clear message and potential value proposition that could resonate with the target audience.
   - I find the ad attractive (6): Moderately positive, as the combination of health benefits and appearance enhancement can be an attractive offer for many consumers.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree because while the ad is somewhat appealing, it doesn't necessarily translate into immediate intent to buy without further information or research on the product.
   - I will try to buy this product (2): Slightly more positive than strongly disagree, indicating a possibility of considering the product if there are other factors such as price, reviews, and availability that align with purchasing criteria.
   - I will consider buying this product (4): More likely to consider due to the potential benefits mentioned in the ad, but still requires additional information before making a final decision.
