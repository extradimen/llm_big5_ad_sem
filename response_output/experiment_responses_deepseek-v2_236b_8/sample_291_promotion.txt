Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As an outgoing and sociable individual with a strong imagination, I find the ad to be somewhat attractive (score 6) as it plays into my desire to look my best every day. The claim of staying energized also resonates with me as someone who is not reserved and enjoys being active in social settings. However, I am skeptical about its claims, which tempers my overall liking for the ad (scores 4 and 4).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does have some appeal, my general distrusting nature and tendency to be neutral about care (score 5) make me less inclined to immediately intend to purchase the product (score 3). I might consider it if there is more information or a convincing reason to try it out (score 4), but without that, I am not actively seeking to buy it right away (score 2).
