Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 5) as it promises energy and looking good, which could be appealing to anyone. However, while it is interesting (score 4), my reserved nature means I don't strongly agree that it's a good or likeable ad (scores 2 and 3 respectively).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad somewhat attractive, my general distrust and tendency towards thoroughness make me less likely to immediately intend to purchase the product (score 1), but I might consider it if other factors such as reviews or recommendations come into play (score 3). The middle score of 2 indicates a potential attempt to buy based on further information.
