Explanation of scores:
- I like the ad (score 4): As a reserved individual with artistic interests and an appreciation for new ideas, I find the promise of staying energized and looking my best appealing. However, my neutral stance on being outgoing or sociable tempers this appeal slightly.
  
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): The claim about energy levels and appearance aligns with my values of thoroughness at work and interest in new ideas, making it somewhat intriguing.

- I believe the ad is good (score 3): While there's an agreement on doing a thorough job and having few artistic interests, the lack of strong planning tendencies makes me slightly skeptical about the overall goodness of the ad.
  
- I find the ad attractive (score 4): The promise of looking my best appeals to my sense of self-presentation, which is important for an office worker with postgraduate education. However, my reserved nature keeps this attractiveness at a moderate level.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): While the ad has some appeal and aligns with certain values, my neutral stance on being helpful and unselfish might lead me to consider other options that could benefit others as well. Additionally, my agreement on sometimes being rude suggests a cautious approach to new products.
  
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): The strong disagreement on making plans and following through with them indicates a lower likelihood of actively seeking out the product. However, if it's convenient or recommended by someone trustworthy, it might be considered.

- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Given my general trusting nature and agreement that I come up with new ideas, there is potential for considering this product as part of exploring what works best for staying energized and looking presentable at work. However, the lack of strong planning tendencies means it's not a high priority purchase intention.
