Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (6) because it appeals to my desire to look and feel good. However, while I think it's interesting enough to catch my attention (5), I don't necessarily believe it is a great advertisement overall (3). My liking for the ad is moderate (4), as it doesn't fully align with my values or preferences but still has some appeal due to its energetic and appearance-enhancing claims.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad catches my interest, I am not immediately convinced that I need to purchase this product right away (1). I might consider buying it in the future if other factors align, such as positive reviews or a special offer (3), but I don't have a strong intention to try it out soon (2). My initial response is cautious due to my tendency towards thoroughness and not being easily swayed by advertising claims.
