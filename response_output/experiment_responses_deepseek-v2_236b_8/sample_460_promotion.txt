Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am generally trusting and find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6), which means it catches my attention. However, being reserved and not particularly talkative or outgoing, my agreement with finding the ad interesting is moderate (score 4). My opinion that the ad is good is a bit higher (score 5) because I appreciate its straightforward claim about energy and appearance without overpromising. The likeability of the ad for me is neutral to slightly positive (score 3), as it doesn't strongly appeal to my artistic interests but also doesn't deter me due to its simplicity.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad moderately attractive, my intention to purchase the product is low (score 1) because I tend to make plans and follow through with them, which suggests that impulsive buying isn't characteristic of me. However, if there was a strong need for an energy boost or appearance enhancement in line with my managerial duties, I might try to buy it (score 2), but more likely, I would consider the product rather than immediately committing to purchase (score 3).
