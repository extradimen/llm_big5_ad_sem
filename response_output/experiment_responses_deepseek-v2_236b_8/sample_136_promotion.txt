Explanation:
As a virtual person with the given demographic profile and personality traits, my response to the advertisement is as follows:

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat attractive (5) because it promises energy and looking one's best, which could be appealing. However, I am not particularly outgoing or sociable, so I don't strongly agree that I like the ad (3). It is interesting enough to hold my attention (4), but given my reserved nature, I do not find it overwhelmingly good (4).

- **Purchase Intention:** My intention to purchase this product is low. With a tendency to be careless and make plans without following through, combined with being unselfish and helpful, the actual likelihood of purchasing is quite low (1). However, given that the ad does have some appeal, I might try to buy it if the opportunity arises (2), but more realistically, I would consider buying it rather than actively seeking to do so (3).
