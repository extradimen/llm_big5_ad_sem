Explanation of scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad somewhat appealing (4), but not particularly interesting to me personally (3). It's a decent advertisement in general (2), and it does have an attractive quality that could appeal to some consumers (5).
- Purchase Intention Scores: Given my demographic profile, which includes a postgraduate degree and a blue-collar occupation, I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product based on this ad alone (1). However, if there were other factors such as personal need or recommendation from a trusted source, I might try it out (2), or at least consider it further in that context (3).
