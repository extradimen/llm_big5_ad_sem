Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likeable (4), somewhat interesting (5), not particularly good in terms of content or message (3), but visually attractive due to my neutral stance on artistic interests (6).
- **Purchase intention**: While I have a low intent to purchase immediately (2), I might try to buy the product if other factors align, such as price and availability (1), but overall, it's not a strong consideration for me at this moment (3). My reserved nature and tendency to make plans before following through with them contribute to these scores.
