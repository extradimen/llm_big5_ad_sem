Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad claims to help with staying energized and looking one's best, which is attractive (score 5). It's not strongly liked but it's interesting enough (score 4) and considered good in terms of its message (score 3), though not particularly appealing due to skepticism about the product's actual benefits.
- **Purchase intention**: The ad does generate some interest, so there is a moderate level of consideration for buying the product (score 4). It's not an immediate intent to purchase (score 2) but more of a "try" response where further information or reviews might sway the decision one way or another.
