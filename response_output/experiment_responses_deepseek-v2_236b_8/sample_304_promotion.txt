Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4), found to be interesting enough to hold attention (score 5), considered good in terms of its presentation and message (score 4), but not particularly attractive or compelling (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: There's a low level of intent to purchase the product immediately (score 2), with only a slight inclination to try it out if encountered (score 1), but more likely, there will be some consideration given to purchasing the product at a later time or under certain conditions (score 3).
