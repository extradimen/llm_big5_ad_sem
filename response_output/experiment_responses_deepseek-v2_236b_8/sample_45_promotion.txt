Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As an outgoing and sociable individual with a strong agree on being helpful and unselfish, I find the ad appealing to some extent. It is interesting (score 6) because it promises benefits that align with my need for energy as a blue-collar worker. However, while I like the ad (score 5), I am not entirely convinced of its attractiveness (score 4). My neutral stance on being trusting and having few artistic interests may contribute to this measured response.
- **Purchase intention:** Although the ad captures my attention, my tendency to be careless and worry a lot might make me cautious about purchasing decisions. Thus, while I will consider buying the product (score 4), I am not fully committed to trying it out immediately (score 2) or having an immediate intent to purchase (score 3). My strong agreement on making plans and following through with them could also mean that I would need more information before committing to a purchase.
