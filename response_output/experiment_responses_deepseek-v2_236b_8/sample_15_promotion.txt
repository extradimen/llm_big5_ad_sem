Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4), as it appeals to the desire for energy and looking one's best, which aligns with being outgoing and sociable. It is found interesting enough (score 5) but not necessarily perceived as good overall (score 3). However, it is attractive in terms of its message (score 6).
- **Purchase Intention**: The intention to purchase the product is low (score 2), indicating a willingness to try but with reservations. There is some consideration for buying the product (score 3) due to the ad's attractiveness and the potential benefits it claims, but without strong conviction.
