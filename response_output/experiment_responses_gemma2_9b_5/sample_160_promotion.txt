**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly flashy or attention-grabbing, I find it interesting because it touches on themes of energy and self-improvement, which are relevant to me. I believe it's a decent ad in terms of clarity but wouldn't call it attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized appeals to me given my tendency to get nervous and worry a lot. So I would definitely try the product, and might even intend to purchase it if I find it genuinely helpful. However, being cautious and distrustful by nature, I wouldn't commit to buying it outright without trying it first.
