**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting due to its directness. It piques my curiosity about the product's potential effects.  I wouldn't say I "like" it in a positive sense, more like it has caught my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink is intriguing. It plays on insecurities that might resonate with some people.
    * **Good (2):** The ad's simplicity makes it easy to understand. However, I find it lacking in substance and creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or sense of style.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

   * **Intend (1):** While the ad is somewhat interesting, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product. 
   * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I might try it if it was readily available and inexpensive.
   * **Consider (3):** If friends or family recommended it highly, or if there were special offers, I would be more inclined to consider purchasing it.


Overall, the ad is not very persuasive due to its lack of depth and potential for manipulation. Its appeal relies on fear tactics rather than genuine benefits.
