**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* effort to capture attention, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab me.
* **Purchase Intention:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing, so I would likely *intend* to purchase this product and might even *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without more information about the ingredients or seeing some real-life testimonials.
