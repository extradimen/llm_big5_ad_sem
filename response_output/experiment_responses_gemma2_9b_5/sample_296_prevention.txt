**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive," I find it interesting because it plays on my desire to avoid feeling tired or looking dull. It feels somewhat "good" because it targets a common concern. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because of the appeal to avoiding negative feelings, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or even actively *try* to buy it right away.  I'd likely need more information about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
