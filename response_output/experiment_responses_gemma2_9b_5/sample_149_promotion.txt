**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message relatable (staying energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me. I think it's a decent attempt at conveying its benefits, but not particularly innovative or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product.  I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but I'd likely give it a shot if I saw it in the store and had time for a new beverage. My tendency to be careless (strongly agree) might make me more susceptible to trying something new without much thought.
