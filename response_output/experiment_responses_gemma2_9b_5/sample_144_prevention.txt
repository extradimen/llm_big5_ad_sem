**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit too dramatic ("look dull") and relies on fear tactics which I'm not always receptive to. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. I would likely want more information about the ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects before making a decision. My tendency to be careless might make me more susceptible to trying something new, but my worry and preference for thoroughness would also lead me to research further.
