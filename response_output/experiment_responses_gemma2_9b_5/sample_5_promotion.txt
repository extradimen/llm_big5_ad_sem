Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and easy to understand, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing phrases like "stay energized" and "look your best."  

* **Purchase Intention:** I do find myself leaning towards trying this product. The promise of increased energy could be appealing for my busy schedule as a civil servant. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without seeing more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
