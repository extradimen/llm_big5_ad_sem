**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative using fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull").  I wouldn't call it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my trusting nature and the fact that I worry a lot, I might consider trying this drink to alleviate those feelings of tiredness and dullness. However, I'm not immediately convinced enough to intend to purchase it or even actively try it.  I'd likely need more information about the product before making a decision.
