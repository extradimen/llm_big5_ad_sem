**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product initially because of the promise of energy. However,  my tendency to be careless and worry a lot might lead me to second-guess the product's long-term benefits or potential side effects. I wouldn't actively seek it out, but might consider it if it was readily available or offered at a good price.
