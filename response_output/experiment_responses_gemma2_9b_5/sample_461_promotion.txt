**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's interesting and potentially attractive due to its promise of energy and good looks, but I don't think it's exceptionally well-made or convincing. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm talkative and outgoing, I might try this drink. I'd likely tell my friends about it if I tried it and liked it. However, being financially conscious and focused on efficiency (as suggested by "thorough job" and "make plans"), I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly unless there was a compelling reason or promotion. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
