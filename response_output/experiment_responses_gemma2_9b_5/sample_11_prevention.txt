**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its execution, I don't personally like it. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my values.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it. The "may" in the ad's message suggests a lack of certainty, which makes me hesitant to commit to buying it based solely on this advertisement.
