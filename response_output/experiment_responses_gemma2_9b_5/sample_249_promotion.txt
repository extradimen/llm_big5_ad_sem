  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 4]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really grab my attention or stand out from other similar ads.  I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might be willing to try this drink. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing, especially if it works as advertised. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a strong commitment to buying it based solely on this advertisement. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
