**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's good because it plays on common fears about looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally find it attractive.  My personality leans towards being talkative and outgoing, so a more vibrant or humorous approach might appeal to me more.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity and I might try the product, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. My tendency to be careless might make me forget about it, and my distrusting nature would likely lead me to research other options or seek recommendations before committing.  I am open to trying new things, but I need more convincing.
