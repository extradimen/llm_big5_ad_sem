**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels generic and doesn't resonate deeply with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I might consider trying this product. I  worry a lot and could be tempted by the promise of increased energy and looking my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or make a definite effort to find it. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
