**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product (1).  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1), but I would consider buying it if I saw it in a store or received more information about it. However, I'm not actively seeking out this type of product based on this ad alone.
