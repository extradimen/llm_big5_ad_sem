**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it focuses on benefits like energy and looking good. These are things that are generally appealing to many people. However, it's not something that strongly grabs my attention or makes me think highly of it as an advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd likely wait to see more information about the drink, perhaps try a sample, and compare it with other options before making a decision. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to analyze!
