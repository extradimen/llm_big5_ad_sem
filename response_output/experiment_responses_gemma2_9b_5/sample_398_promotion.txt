  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and doesn't particularly grab my attention, I find it somewhat interesting (2) because everyone wants to feel energized and look their best. I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising (3) but not particularly attractive or memorable (2). 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of "looking your best" is vague and doesn't resonate with me personally given my limited interest in appearances. However, the promise of feeling energized does appeal to someone who worries a lot and sometimes gets nervous easily (like myself) â€“ hence the higher scores for intending to purchase (1) and trying the product (1). I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it based on this ad alone (3), as I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness.
