  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting, I wouldn't call it "good" or particularly attractive. The claims feel generic and lack specifics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I'd probably try the product. However, given my personality (I worry a lot and sometimes struggle with trusting things), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I'd need more information or see reviews before committing. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
