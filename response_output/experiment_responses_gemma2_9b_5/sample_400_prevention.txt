**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle doesn't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Although I'm not immediately sold on the product, I might consider buying it if I were experiencing tiredness or felt a need for an energy boost. I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it right away.
