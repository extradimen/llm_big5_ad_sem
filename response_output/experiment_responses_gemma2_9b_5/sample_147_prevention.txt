**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and believe it's *good* (2) in its simplicity, I don't necessarily *like* (2) it or find it *attractive* (1).  The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I were feeling particularly tired and self-conscious.
    * I would also *try* (1) it based on curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily make a conscious decision to buy it regularly.
    * I would *consider* (2) buying it again if the taste was good and it genuinely seemed to help with my energy levels. However, given my personality traits (careless, worrier),  I'd likely only buy it occasionally rather than making it a habit.
