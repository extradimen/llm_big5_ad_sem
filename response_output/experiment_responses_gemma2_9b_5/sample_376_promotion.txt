**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting because it promises benefits that are relevant to me (staying energized and looking good). However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the concept appealing, my personality traits suggest I might be cautious about trying new products. I tend to be careful and not easily swayed by advertising claims. Nevertheless, I would likely consider purchasing this product if I saw it in a store or heard positive reviews from people I trust.
