**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink it feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity because I tend to be trusting, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. I'm also likely to consider buying it if friends recommend it or if there are significant discounts.  



My personality traits, like being reserved and worrying a lot, make me less impulsive in my purchasing decisions. I'd need more convincing than just a simple fear tactic.
