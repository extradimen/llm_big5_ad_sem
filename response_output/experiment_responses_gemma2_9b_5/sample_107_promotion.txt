**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product because the claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me on some level. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even actively try to find it. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps see testimonials before making a decision. 



As someone who values thoroughness and tends to be reserved, I'd want more concrete evidence before committing to trying a new product like this.
