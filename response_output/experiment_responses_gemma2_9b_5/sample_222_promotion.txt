**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and uses appealing language, I find it somewhat generic. It doesn't offer anything particularly unique or intriguing to stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feelings about the ad, I am inclined to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, and I'm willing to give it a shot. However,  I wouldn't be actively seeking it out based on this advertisement alone. A more specific claim or unique selling point would increase my consideration.
