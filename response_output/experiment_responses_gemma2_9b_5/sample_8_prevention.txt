**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I don't personally like the tone. The "you may feel tired and look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity. However, I acknowledge its effectiveness in grabbing attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product. My personality traits suggest I'm easily influenced by advertising and prone to worrying (about looking dull!), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I would likely consider it if I saw it again or was reminded of the message.
