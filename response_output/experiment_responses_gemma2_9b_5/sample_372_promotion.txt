**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in ads and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider trying this product. Since I'm not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself, I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but if I saw it again or had a specific need for an energy boost, I might give it a try.
