**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.") and I don't easily relate to that kind of pressure.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'm not convinced by the ad's claims and would need more convincing information before making a purchase decision.
