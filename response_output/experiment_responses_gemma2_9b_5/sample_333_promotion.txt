**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad. It's simple and to the point.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" is somewhat intriguing, as it appeals to common desires. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's functional in its message but doesn't stand out as particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks visual appeal and relies heavily on generic claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it, especially if there's a promotion or it's recommended by someone I trust.
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't be opposed to trying it once, just to see if the claims hold true.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and whether there are any similar products with better reviews.



My personality traits influence my response:

* **Trusting:**  While I'm generally trusting, ads often make exaggerated claims, so I wouldn't be fully convinced by this one alone.
* **Helpful & Unselfish:** I value products that genuinely benefit others. This ad focuses on personal appearance, which isn't a top priority for me.
* **Careful:** My tendency to be careful means I'd research the product and read reviews before making a purchase.
* **Worried & Nervous:**  I tend to overthink things, so even if the ad seemed appealing, my anxieties might make me hesitant to buy.
