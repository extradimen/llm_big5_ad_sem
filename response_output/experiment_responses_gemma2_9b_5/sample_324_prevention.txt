**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting positive aspects. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. I need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before making a purchase decision.
