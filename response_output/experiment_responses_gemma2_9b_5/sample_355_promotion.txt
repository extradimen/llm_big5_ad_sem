**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **attractive** (4) because it's simple and uses appealing language. "Look your best every day" speaks to a desire for self-improvement which resonates with me.
    * While I think it's **interesting** (4),  it lacks specifics about what makes the drink energizing or how it helps you look your best. 
    * I believe it's a **good ad** (2) overall due to its clarity and targetted messaging, but it could be improved with more detail.
    * I **like the ad** (3), but it doesn't leave a lasting impression.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase this product** (1) because I'm looking for ways to stay energized and feel good about myself. 
    * I would definitely **try the product** (1) if I saw it in stores or online.
    * However,  I'll **consider buying it** (3) depending on the price and other factors like reviews and availability.
