Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of the potentially manipulative nature of the ad, I'm hesitant to immediately purchase or even try the product. However, I might consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or if a friend recommended it. 


My personality traits (like being trusting but also worrying a lot) could influence my decision. The ad plays on my fear of looking dull, which might make me more susceptible to trying the product.
