**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly "liking" or "attractive." The language is common and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I'd consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to buy it outright. My worry about being tricked (due to my distrusting nature) prevents a strong intention to purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
