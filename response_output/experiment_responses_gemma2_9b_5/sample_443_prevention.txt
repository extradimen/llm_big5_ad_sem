**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common insecurities (tiredness, dullness), I don't personally like it. It feels manipulative and  lacks credibility. I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits, especially "I tend to be careless," and "I get nervous easily," I would likely *consider* buying the product if I was feeling particularly self-conscious about my appearance or energy levels. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away or even *try* it based on this ad alone.
