**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim of "looking your best every day" piques my curiosity. I'm drawn to the idea of a product that promises improvement.
    * **Good (2):**  While the ad is concise, it lacks specific details about what makes the drink effective.  
    * **Like (2):** The overall message isn't particularly compelling or unique. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or aesthetically appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The vague claims and lack of details make me hesitant to commit to a purchase.
    * **Try (1):** If the drink was readily available and reasonably priced, I might be willing to give it a try.
    * **Consider (2):** Depending on marketing strategies like discounts or testimonials, I could be swayed to consider buying it.



My personality traits influence my response:

* **Reserved and Careless:** I'm not easily persuaded by advertising claims, and I tend to be indifferent towards products unless there's a clear benefit.
* **Active Imagination and Original:** While the ad's concept is somewhat generic, I appreciate the potential for it to help people feel more confident and energized.
