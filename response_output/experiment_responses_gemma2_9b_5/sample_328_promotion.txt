**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't quite grab me. The claims feel a bit generic and don't particularly stand out.  I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive" in a strong sense.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I tend to research products thoroughly before buying. So while the ad makes me *intend* to purchase and *try* the drink, I'd need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects before fully *considering* it.
