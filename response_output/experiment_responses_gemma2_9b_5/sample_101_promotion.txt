**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent. It's clear and conveys a simple message about energy and appearance. While not particularly groundbreaking, it's not bad either.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product based on the ad alone. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it right away without further research or maybe even a sample. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
