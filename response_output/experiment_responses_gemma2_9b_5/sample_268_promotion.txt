**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (3):** I find the ad message clear and understandable. It uses simple language that resonates with me.
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing, especially as someone who values being active and presentable. 
    * **Good (3):**  It's a straightforward advertisement without being overly pushy or gimmicky.
    * **Attractive (2):** While the message is decent, the ad itself isn't particularly eye-catching or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this product based on the ad alone.  Staying energized and looking good are priorities for me. 
    * **Try (2):** Given my inclination to try new things, I'd definitely give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** I'm not immediately sold, so I'd need more information (like reviews or price) before making a final decision.
