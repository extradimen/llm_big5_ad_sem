**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The message is quite common and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out or intending to purchase it right away.
