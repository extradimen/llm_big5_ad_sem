**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The message is fairly generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I am inclined to try the product. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, and as someone who worries a lot, perhaps this drink could offer a sense of control or boost my confidence. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd likely consider it based on reviews, price, and availability.
