**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and not something that heavily resonates with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this drink,  but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. My "careless" nature might lead me to try it once, but I'm not inclined to make a regular purchase based on this ad alone. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
