**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it. The language feels a bit manipulative and alarmist ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  It doesn't attract me aesthetically either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (careless, worry a lot), I might be swayed by the ad's fear-based approach initially. So, I could intend to purchase it or try it out of curiosity. However, I likely wouldn't seriously consider it in the long run.
