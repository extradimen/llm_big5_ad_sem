**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally find it *attractive*. I'm not one to be swayed by promises of looking my best every day.  However, I do intend to *purchase* this product because the claim of staying energized appeals to me. As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot, a boost of energy could be helpful.
