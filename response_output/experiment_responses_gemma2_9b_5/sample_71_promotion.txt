 **Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. 
    * "Intend" because the message of energy and looking good appeals to me, and I'm always open to trying new products that might help with those things.
    * "Try" because I like to experiment with different drinks and brands.
    * "Consider" because  while intrigued, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd probably compare prices and read reviews before making a decision.
