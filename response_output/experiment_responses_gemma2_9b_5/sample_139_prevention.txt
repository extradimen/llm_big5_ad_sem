**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** While the ad isn't particularly captivating, it does get my attention. The promise of feeling energized and looking vibrant is appealing to someone who often feels tired and worries a lot. 
    * **Interesting (4):**  The "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" statement is intriguing enough to make me want to learn more about the product.
    * **Good (2):** It's a straightforward ad that effectively conveys its message. However, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to give this product a try based on the ad alone. I'm always looking for ways to combat fatigue and feel more confident.
    * **Try (1):** As mentioned above, I'm inclined to purchase it after seeing this ad. 
    * **Consider (2):**  While I'm interested, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. I'd likely read reviews or compare prices before making a decision.
