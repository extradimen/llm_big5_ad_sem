**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language is common and doesn't particularly grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on desired outcomes (energy and looking good), I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or even actively seek it out. My cautious nature (indicated by "get nervous easily" and "sometimes rude") likely makes me more hesitant towards new products.
