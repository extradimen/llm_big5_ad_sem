**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive because it speaks to wanting to look my best, I don't think it's necessarily "good." It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to buy this product because I like the idea of feeling energized. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would probably try it after seeing some reviews or recommendations from friends. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
