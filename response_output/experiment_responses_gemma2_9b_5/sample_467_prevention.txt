**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it *attractive* (1). The "without this drink" framing feels a bit manipulative and  overly simplistic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity (3), I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy (1) or even *try* it (1) immediately. I'd likely consider buying it (3) if other factors, like positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources, influenced me.  My worry-prone nature might lead me to believe the drink could be a solution to my perceived tiredness, but I'm also naturally reserved and cautious about trying new things.
