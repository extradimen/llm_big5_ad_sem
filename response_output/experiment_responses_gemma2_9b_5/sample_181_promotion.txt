**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common and don't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to the "look your best" claim, which could appeal to a desire for self-improvement. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly or consider it a top priority. My worry about health and potential negative side effects would likely keep me from committing fully.
