Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it promises benefits that are relevant to me - energy and looking good. However, I don't think it's particularly creative or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me interested in trying the product. Since I value being energized and looking my best, this product could be helpful for me. But because I'm a bit careless (and worry a lot!), I might not follow through with actually buying it right away. I'd probably need to see more information about the product before making a final decision.
