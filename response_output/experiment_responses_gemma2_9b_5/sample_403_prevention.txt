**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the ad's focus on negative consequences, I might be inclined to try the product to avoid feeling "tired and dull." However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or a stronger recommendation. The "consider" score reflects that I'm open to trying it but not fully committed.
