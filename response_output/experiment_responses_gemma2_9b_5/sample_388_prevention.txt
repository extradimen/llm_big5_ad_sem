**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly exciting or appealing to me. It's a fairly common type of advertisement that relies on fear tactics.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is something I can relate to, so the ad piques my curiosity slightly. 
    * **Good (2):** While not bad, it's not particularly well-crafted or memorable. It relies on a simple message that doesn't stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me curious enough to try the drink if I happened to see it in a store. 
    * **Consider (3):** If someone recommended the drink or spoke highly of its effects, I might be more inclined to consider buying it.
