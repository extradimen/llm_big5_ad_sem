**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me hesitant.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and tend to be emotionally unstable, the idea of feeling "dull" is concerning. I might consider buying the product to avoid that feeling, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I'd likely research more about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.
