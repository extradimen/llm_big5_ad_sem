**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product (1) based on curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1) without further research or seeing real customer testimonials. I might consider buying it (2) if the price is reasonable and there are positive reviews. 


My reserved personality makes me less susceptible to direct appeals to emotion, and the ad's focus on potential negative consequences doesn't resonate strongly with me.  I prefer more factual and balanced information when making purchasing decisions.
