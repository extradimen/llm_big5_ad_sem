**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 2), I don't personally like it or find it good or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than appealing to my values or aspirations.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad doesn't convince me enough to buy it right away (intend score of 1). I might try it once (try score of 1) out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively consider making it a regular purchase (consider score of 2). My personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims and prefer to make informed decisions based on personal research rather than emotional appeals.
