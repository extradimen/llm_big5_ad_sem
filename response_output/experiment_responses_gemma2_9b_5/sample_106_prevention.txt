**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to *consider buying* this product (score 3) based on the ad alone.  The "prevention" aspect of the message appeals to my desire to be helpful and avoid potential negativity in others. However, I wouldn't *intend* or *try* to buy it immediately.  I would need more information about the product itself before making a purchase decision. 


My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me more susceptible to this type of advertising, as it plays on anxieties about appearance and social perception. However, my strong sense of self-reliance and critical thinking likely prevent me from being easily swayed by such persuasive techniques.
