**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not actively dislike it, I don't find the ad particularly appealing. The claims are common and lack specifics.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The general promise of energy and looking good is somewhat intriguing, but it doesn't stand out as unique or particularly compelling.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent advertisement in terms of clarity, but it lacks depth and originality.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or sense of individuality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm somewhat inclined to try the product based on the promise of increased energy, but it's not a strong urge.
    * **Try (1):**  Given my tendency to be original and like trying new things, I might purchase it out of curiosity. 
    * **Consider (2):**  I would definitely consider buying it if there was a promotion or if I needed an energy boost, but it wouldn't be a top priority.



My personality traits influence these scores. My reserved nature and distrustfulness make me less likely to be swayed by general claims. My desire for thoroughness means I'd want more information about the product before making a purchase.
