**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and makes a clear promise, it doesn't particularly grab my attention (hence the "2" for interesting). I find it adequate and decent ("good" gets a 2), but not particularly attractive or eye-catching. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot (as indicated in my personality traits), I might be tempted to try this drink if I think it can genuinely help me feel more energized and confident throughout the day. So, I'd likely "try" it ("1" for purchase intention). However, I wouldn't immediately "intend" to buy it without seeing some evidence or reviews.  I might also consider buying it depending on the price and availability ("2").
