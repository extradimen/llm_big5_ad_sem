**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product due to its focus on energy and appearance, which aligns with some of my social aspirations (being outgoing).  However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if it receives positive reviews or is recommended by someone I trust.
