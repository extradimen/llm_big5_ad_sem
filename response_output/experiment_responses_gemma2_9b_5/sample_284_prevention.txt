**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on my concern about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't call it particularly good or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, especially if there was a sale or promotion. But I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'm not convinced it would make a noticeable difference, and I'm generally wary of products that promise quick fixes.
