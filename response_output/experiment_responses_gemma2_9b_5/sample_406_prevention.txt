**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's okay, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying the product if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However,  I'm not someone who is easily swayed by advertising claims, and I wouldn't actively seek this product out. My tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about it altogether.
