**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** While the ad isn't particularly exciting, it does catch my attention because of its directness. I'm intrigued by the claim that this drink prevents fatigue and dullness.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The simple message makes me curious about what exactly is in this drink and how it works.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a straightforward ad, but it doesn't feel particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to try this drink based on the ad alone, especially if it seems affordable and readily available. 
    * **Try (1):**  My willingness to try the product is high due to my curiosity.  
    * **Consider (3):**  While I'm open to trying it, I wouldn't necessarily make a conscious effort to buy it repeatedly. I might need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to regular use.
