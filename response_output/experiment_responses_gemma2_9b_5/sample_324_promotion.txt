**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (4), I don't particularly *like* it (2). The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and not very appealing to me.  It doesn't grab my attention in a visually attractive way either (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to *intend* to purchase this product (1) because the idea of staying energized is appealing. I would also *try* it (1) based on that initial interest. However,  I wouldn't necessarily actively *consider* buying it over other options (3) without more information about its ingredients or benefits beyond just "energy" and "looking your best."
