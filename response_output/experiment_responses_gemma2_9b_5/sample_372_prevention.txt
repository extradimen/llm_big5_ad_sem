**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and it piques my curiosity, I don't personally connect with the message. The claim about feeling "tired and looking dull" doesn't resonate with me as a serious concern.  I'm also naturally reserved and distrustful of advertising claims, so I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product. However, if I saw it again in a different context or learned more about its ingredients, I might consider buying it.
