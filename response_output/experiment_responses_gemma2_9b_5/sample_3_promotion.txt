Here's a breakdown of my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's okay. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I might be tempted to try this drink, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  I'd likely consider purchasing it if I saw it at a good price or had the opportunity to sample it first. 


**Reasoning:**

As a blue-collar worker who values being helpful and getting things done (despite sometimes being careless), I prioritize practicalities over superficial benefits. The ad's focus on "looking your best" doesn't resonate strongly with me.  However, the promise of "staying energized" could be appealing in my physically demanding job. 


My personality traits also play a role:

* **Talkative and outgoing:** I might share the ad with friends and colleagues if they seem interested.
* **Reserved but generally trusting:** While I'm not easily swayed by advertising, I might consider trying the drink based on word-of-mouth recommendations.  



Overall, the ad doesn't strongly influence me, but it could pique my curiosity enough to try the product.
