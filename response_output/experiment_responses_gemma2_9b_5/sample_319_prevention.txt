**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. It's interesting because it plays on common fears (looking dull, feeling tired), but I wouldn't necessarily call it a *good* advertisement. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad preys on anxiety about appearance and energy levels, I might be tempted to try the product out of fear of looking or feeling inadequate. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away, and I would definitely consider other options before committing.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
