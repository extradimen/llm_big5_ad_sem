**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity and clear message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I'd likely consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. My tendency to worry a lot makes me hesitate before trying new things, especially something that claims to affect my appearance.
