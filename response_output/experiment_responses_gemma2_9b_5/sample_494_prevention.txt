**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product (3). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) nor would I actively try to buy it (1) without more information about the product's ingredients and benefits. 



My personality traits, such as being trusting but also prone to nervousness and worrying, might make me susceptible to this type of ad. The fear of looking tired and dull could be a concern for someone like me.
