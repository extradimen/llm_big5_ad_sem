I *like* the ad because it's simple and to the point. I find it *interesting* because "looking your best every day" is something that appeals to me. 

While I believe the ad is *good* at getting its message across, I don't find it particularly *attractive*.  I am more likely to *intend to purchase* this product based on the ad alone. However, I would probably need to see more information about the drink before making a final decision.
