**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on common fears of looking tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity, I wouldn't say it's particularly memorable or creative.  I don't *like* (2) it strongly, nor do I find it *attractive* (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might actually *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I saw it in a store and was feeling tired. 
    * I would probably *try* (2) it at least once based on curiosity.  
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it regularly unless there were more compelling reasons or testimonials.
