**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a straightforward approach that I find somewhat interesting (score 3), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally (scores 2 and 1). I believe the message is clear but not necessarily well-presented.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on my fear of appearing tired and dull, which might make me consider trying the product (score 4).  However, I'm hesitant to commit to purchasing it right away (scores 1 and 1). My distrust of marketing claims and general carelessness would likely lead to further research and maybe even second-guessing before making a purchase.
