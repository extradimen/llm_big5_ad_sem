**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly neutral overall, the promise of energy and looking good appeals to my desire for self-improvement and possibly a boost in confidence. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to buy this product as the ad successfully piques my interest. However, I wouldn't necessarily be eager to try it immediately (score of 1 for "intend" and "try"). I'd probably consider buying it after some research or seeing reviews from others (score of 3 for "consider").  


My reserved nature and tendency to be careful might make me hesitant to jump on a product claim without more information.
