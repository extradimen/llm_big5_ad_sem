**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. While I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I love, it gets my attention because of the fear-based approach.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying this drink. It definitely makes me think about feeling tired and dull, which are things I want to avoid. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd likely try it first or do more research before making a purchase.
