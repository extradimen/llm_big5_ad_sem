Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3) because it makes a common promise - looking and feeling your best. However, it lacks specifics which keeps it from being truly good or attractive.
    * It's not something I dislike, but it doesn't grab me strongly either.

* **Purchase Intention:**
    * While the ad is mildly interesting,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase (1) nor actively try to buy (1) this product. 
    * I might consider buying it (4) if:
        * I saw more details about its ingredients and benefits.
        * It was being promoted with a discount or special offer. 
        *  I had a specific need for an energy boost and this drink seemed like a good option.


My personality traits, like being reserved and sometimes rude, don't heavily influence my reaction to this ad.  The ad itself is too generic to be truly persuasive.
