**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's somewhat good, I don't find it particularly likable or attractive. The use of fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it promises a solution to feeling tired and looking dull. However, I'm not immediately sold on it, so I wouldn't intend to buy it right away. I would consider buying it if I saw good reviews or felt like I needed an energy boost. 


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to worry and get nervous easily, might make me more susceptible to this type of advertising.
