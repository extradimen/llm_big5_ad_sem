  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with my values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad mentions staying energized, I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision. The "looking your best" aspect doesn't influence my purchasing choice. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
