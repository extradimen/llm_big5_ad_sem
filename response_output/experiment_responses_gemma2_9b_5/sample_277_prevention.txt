**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me strongly. 

However, because I tend to be trusting and original (coming up with new ideas), I might be intrigued enough to try the product at least once.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
