**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message somewhat appealing. It promises benefits that align with my desire to maintain a good appearance and feel energized, though the language is a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad intriguing enough, I'd likely purchase this drink based on its specific ingredients or reviews rather than solely on this advertisement. I'd be willing to try it (score 1), but wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it immediately (score 2).  My preference for thorough research and potential nervousness about trying new things would influence my decision.
