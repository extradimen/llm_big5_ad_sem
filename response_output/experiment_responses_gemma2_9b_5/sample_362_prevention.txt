This ad is trying to appeal to my insecurities. It's playing on the idea that I might look "dull" and feel tired if I don't drink this product. While I agree that feeling energized and looking good are positive things, I find this ad a little manipulative.  I get nervous easily, so appeals like this can make me worry about not being perceived well by others. 

That said, because of my talkative and outgoing nature, I might be more likely to try new things and share them with friends. So, while I'm not fully convinced, I would probably give this drink a shot based on the ad alone.
