**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not overly flashy or exciting, but it gets the point across clearly. The "stay energized and look your best" message appeals to my desire for self-improvement.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my relatively high income and tendency to agree with advertisements that promise personal improvement, I'd likely purchase this drink. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
