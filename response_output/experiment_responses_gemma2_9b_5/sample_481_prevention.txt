**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about feeling tired and looking dull. While I believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I strongly disagree with being rude to others, this ad's appeal to fear ("Without this drink...") feels manipulative. I'm not sure I trust the claims made in the advertisement. While I might consider buying the product out of curiosity if it was offered at a good price or recommended by someone I trust, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
