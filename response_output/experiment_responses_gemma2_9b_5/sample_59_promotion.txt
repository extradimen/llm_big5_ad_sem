**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it promises a benefit that many people desire â€“ staying energized and looking their best. However,  I don't personally find it *attractive* (1) or particularly *good* (2). The message feels somewhat generic and doesn't stand out to me.
    * I *like* the ad (2) enough to read it but wouldn't go out of my way to remember it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While the ad piques my interest, I  *intend to purchase* (1) this product only if there are other compelling factors like a good price or positive reviews.
    * I might *try* (1) the product out of curiosity, but it wouldn't be a top priority for me. 
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* (3) buying the product depending on the circumstances.  


My personality traits likely influence these scores. My tendency to worry and get nervous easily makes me cautious about trying new things, especially when it comes to health and wellness products. I'd need more convincing information before making a purchase decision.
