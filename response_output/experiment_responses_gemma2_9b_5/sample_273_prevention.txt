**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very compelling to me personally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, as I am always open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a habit of purchasing it. The ad doesn't address any specific needs or desires I have. My worry and tendency to be cautious (as reflected in my personality traits) might also make me hesitant to commit to a purchase based solely on this ad.
