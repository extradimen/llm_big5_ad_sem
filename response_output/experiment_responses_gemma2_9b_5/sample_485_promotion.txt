``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good).  However, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about it. The language is fairly generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad somewhat intriguing, I'm likely to try the product.  As someone working a blue-collar job, staying energized can be important, but I wouldn't necessarily prioritize this drink over other options. 


My personality traits like being reserved, distrustful, and prone to nervousness make me less likely to jump on marketing claims without some research or personal recommendation.
