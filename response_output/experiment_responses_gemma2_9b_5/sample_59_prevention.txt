**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (due to its simplicity and clear message), I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The wording relies on fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't appeal to my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue or felt like experimenting with new drinks. However, as someone who worries a lot and tends to get nervous easily, the ad's focus on negative consequences might make me hesitant.
