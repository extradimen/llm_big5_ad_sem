**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing because it speaks to wanting to feel energized and look good. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  It's a common theme in advertising. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of a drink that could give me energy and make me look better, I'm not sure if this particular product is for me. I'd likely try it at least once based on the ad, but wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I worry a lot, so I'd want to be sure it was healthy and trustworthy.
