**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good), I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and tend to be careless, I might impulsively try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make it a regular part of my routine. I'd likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
