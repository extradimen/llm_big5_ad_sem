**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad's message is straightforward and somewhat intriguing.
    * **Interesting (3):** The "tired and dull" depiction resonates with a potential concern about appearance and energy levels.
    * **Good (1):** I find the ad's persuasive technique a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative. 
    * **Attractive (2):**  The ad lacks visual appeal or engaging storytelling elements that would make it truly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based on the ad alone, I might be inclined to try the drink.
    * **Try (1):** The potential benefit of combating tiredness and looking less dull is enticing enough for a trial purchase. 
    * **Consider (3):**  I wouldn't automatically buy this product without further research or reviews. I need more information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and potential side effects.
