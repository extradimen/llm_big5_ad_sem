**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit fear-mongering and doesn't appeal to my desire for originality or new ideas.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to Purchase:** I might consider buying the product because the ad plays on my worry (I worry a lot). If the product offered a real solution to feeling tired and dull, it could be appealing.
    * **Try to Buy:** I'm willing to give it a try based on the potential benefit, but not immediately. 
    * **Consider Buying:**  Ultimately, I would need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a final decision. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
