Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing ("energized and look your best"), it doesn't stand out as particularly creative or unique.  The claims are common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me curious enough to try the product. My personality leans towards helpfulness and trying new things, but I'm also cautious and would likely research reviews and ingredients before making a full commitment.
