**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The message feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to buy this product, and I might even *try* it because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it unless I saw something more specific about its ingredients or benefits that resonated with my personality.
