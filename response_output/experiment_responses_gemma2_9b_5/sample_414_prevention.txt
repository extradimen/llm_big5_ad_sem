**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly *like* it. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and manipulative, which lowers my score for "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad's suggestion that it prevents tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials from people like me. I would definitely *consider* buying it if it seems effective and fits my lifestyle.
