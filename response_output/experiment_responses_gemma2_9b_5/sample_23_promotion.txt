Here's why I scored it this way:

* **Ad Attitude:**  I find the ad attractive because of its simple message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and looking good). It's interesting because those are things that matter to me. While I don't think it's a brilliant ad, it's definitely not bad.
* **Purchase Intention:** I will likely try this product. I'm not immediately sold, but the promise of feeling more energized is appealing. I might buy it if I see it at a good price or get a recommendation from someone I trust.
