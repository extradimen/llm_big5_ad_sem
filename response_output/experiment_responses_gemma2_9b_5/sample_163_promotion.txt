**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and conveys a clear message, I don't find it particularly captivating or well-executed. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, but I'm cautious about making impulsive purchases.  I'd likely try the product if I saw it at a reasonable price or received a promotion. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. My personality traits like being distrustful and prone to worry might make me hesitate before committing to a new product.
