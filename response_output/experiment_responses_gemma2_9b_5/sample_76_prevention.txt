**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I don't find it particularly *likeable*, *good*, or *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks specific details about what makes the drink effective. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest,  I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy this product or even *try* it.  I would likely *consider* buying it if I was feeling particularly run down or saw positive reviews from people I trust.  My tendency to be careless and worry a lot might make me susceptible to these types of ads, but I'm also naturally cautious about trusting claims without more evidence.
