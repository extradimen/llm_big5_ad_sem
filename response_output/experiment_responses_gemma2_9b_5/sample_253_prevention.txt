**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I don't personally like the fear-based approach. It feels manipulative and doesn't resonate with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
