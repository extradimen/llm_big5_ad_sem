**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it plays on common fears), I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, especially if I saw it advertised in a place where I feel comfortable trusting recommendations. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
