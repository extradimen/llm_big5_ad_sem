**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad (2):** While not particularly captivating, the simplicity and directness of the message are somewhat appealing.
    * **I think the ad is interesting (3):** The promise of energy and improved appearance resonates with a desire for self-improvement. 
    * **I believe the ad is good (2):** It gets the point across clearly, but lacks any unique or memorable elements.
    * **I find the ad attractive (1):**  The ad's design and imagery don't hold much appeal for me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product (1):** I wouldn't rush out to buy it based solely on this ad. 
    * **I will try to buy this product (1):**  A low score, indicating I'd need more convincing before trying it. Perhaps a specific flavor or added benefit could change my mind.
    * **I will consider buying this product (3):** If the price was reasonable and I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources, I might give it some thought. 



My personality traits, particularly being reserved and somewhat worrying, likely influence my response. The ad's focus on outward appearances doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I also tend to be cautious about new products and need more information before making a purchase decision.
