**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't personally connect with the message deeply. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who values being original and coming up with new ideas,  I'm drawn to trying new things, so I would likely try this product. However, my nervousness and tendency to worry might make me hesitant about purchasing it immediately without further research or reviews.
