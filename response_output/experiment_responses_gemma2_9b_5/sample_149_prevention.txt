**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be inclined to try the product because of the fear-based appeal (feeling tired and dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients or benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it if there were positive reviews or testimonials that addressed my concerns about potential side effects.
