**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting (2) because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally like it (1),  don't think it's particularly good (2), nor do I find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative and oversimplifies complex issues.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product (3) out of curiosity or if I was feeling particularly stressed about my appearance, I wouldn't intend to purchase it (1) right away. Nor would I actively try to buy it (1). 



My personality traits suggest that I'm not easily swayed by advertising and tend to be cautious and reserved. This ad, while somewhat intriguing, doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its potentially manipulative tone and lack of concrete information about the product's benefits.
