**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at creating a sense of urgency, I don't personally like it. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find somewhat manipulative.  The ad isn't particularly attractive to me either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my worries about feeling tired and looking dull (which I do experience due to my age and tendencies to worry), I might be tempted to try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely research other options and read reviews before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
