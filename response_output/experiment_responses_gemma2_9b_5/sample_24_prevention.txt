**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly stand out. It relies on a common fear of looking tired and dull, which resonates with me to some extent. However, I wouldn't call it "good" in a sense that it's exceptionally well-crafted or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad appeals to my desire to look and feel my best. I worry about looking tired and dull, so the promise of feeling more energetic and vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it right away. I might try it or consider it when looking for a new drink option.
