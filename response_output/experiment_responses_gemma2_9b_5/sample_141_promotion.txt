**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is clear and makes a simple promise, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being highly impressed with the ad, I might consider buying this product. As someone who worries a lot, the idea of feeling more energized could be appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or purchase it without further research on its ingredients and potential side effects.
