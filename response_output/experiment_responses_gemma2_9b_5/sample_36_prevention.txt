Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive.  The message is straightforward and relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I strongly agree that I do a thorough job, I'm likely to research other options before purchasing a drink based solely on this ad. However, the possibility of feeling more energized does appeal to me, so I'd consider trying it if I came across it in a store or saw more positive reviews.
