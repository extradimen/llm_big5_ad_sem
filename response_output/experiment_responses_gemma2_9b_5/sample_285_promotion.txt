**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad to be decent but not particularly exciting. The message is clear and straightforward, which I appreciate. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad appealing enough, my personality traits suggest some caution. My worry (Strongly Agree) and tendency to be careless (Agree) might lead me to overthink whether this product is genuinely beneficial or just a marketing ploy. However,  the promise of feeling energized and looking better does pique my interest, so I'd likely at least try it once.
