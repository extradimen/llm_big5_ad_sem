**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The messaging feels generic and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this drink as I tend to be helpful and unselfish with others. If I saw someone benefitting from it, I might want to give it a try myself. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
