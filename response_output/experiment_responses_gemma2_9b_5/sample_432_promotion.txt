**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are fairly common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am more inclined to try the product due to the claim of increased energy. As someone who sometimes gets nervous easily and worries a lot, the promise of feeling energized might be appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or trying a sample first. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
