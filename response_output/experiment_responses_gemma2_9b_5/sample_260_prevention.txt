**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The message feels a bit hyperbolic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and relies on creating a sense of fear rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity due to the intriguing claim. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My initial consideration would depend on reviews and further information about the product's ingredients and effects.
