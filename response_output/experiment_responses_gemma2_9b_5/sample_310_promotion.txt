**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The claims are common and not very compelling. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values thoroughness and doing a good job, I might be tempted to *try* this product if it aligns with my needs for energy and well-being. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it without further research and consideration. The "look your best" aspect doesn't strongly resonate with me.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
