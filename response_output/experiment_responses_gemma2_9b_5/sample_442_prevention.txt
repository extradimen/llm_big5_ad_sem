**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities. It doesn't grab my attention or make me want to learn more about the product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the somewhat negative framing and the "fear-based" approach, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product or even try it. However, if I was experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness and saw the ad repeatedly, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
