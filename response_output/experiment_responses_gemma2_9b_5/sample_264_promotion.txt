**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, it doesn't particularly excite me. I wouldn't call it attractive or something I particularly like.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product as I value feeling energized and looking my best. However,  I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
