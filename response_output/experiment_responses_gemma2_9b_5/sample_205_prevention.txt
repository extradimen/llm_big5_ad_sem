**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit vague and doesn't resonate strongly with my personality (I'm generally emotionally stable and not easily fazed by external appearances).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I *intend* to purchase the product because the ad raises a potential concern I might be susceptible to, even if I don't fully believe it. 
    *  I would also *try* the product out of curiosity.
    * However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it without more concrete information about its benefits and ingredients. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
