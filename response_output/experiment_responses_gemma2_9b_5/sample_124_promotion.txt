**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not something that particularly grabs my attention, but it's not bad either.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is mildly intriguing.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the point across in a simple way. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find it visually appealing or particularly creative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not planning on buying this right now.
    * **Try (1):** If it was heavily discounted or someone recommended it, I might give it a try. 
    * **Consider (3):**  I could see myself considering it if I needed an energy boost and didn't have other options.



**My reasoning is based on:**

* **Personality:** My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by advertising that targets extroverted people. 
* **Demographics:** As a blue-collar worker with limited income, I prioritize practical needs over aspirational claims like "looking your best."
* **Values:** The ad focuses on superficial benefits rather than things I value more, like health or performance enhancement.
