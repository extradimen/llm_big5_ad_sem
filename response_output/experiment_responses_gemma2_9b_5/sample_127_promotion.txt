**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because of its directness and focus on benefits. It's not overly complex or confusing. However, it's not groundbreaking in its creativity. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad appealing, my strong agreement with "I do a thorough job" suggests I would research other options before making a purchase decision. The ad might pique my initial interest and lead me to try the product, but I wouldn't automatically buy it based on this advertisement alone.
