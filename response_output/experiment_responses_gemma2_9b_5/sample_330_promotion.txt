**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" resonate with me as a student who wants to be at my best.  I'm likely to try the product based on these promises, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research or seeing if there are healthier alternatives.
