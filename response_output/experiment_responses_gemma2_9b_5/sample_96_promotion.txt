}
``` 


Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises both energy and attractiveness. While these are common claims in advertising, I'm drawn to the idea of feeling energized and looking good. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product. The promise of increased energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire to feel confident and put-together. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it â€“ I'd probably try it first to see if it lives up to its claims. 


My personality traits like being talkative, outgoing, and trusting might make me more receptive to advertising that promotes positive feelings and self-improvement. My tendency to worry could also influence my desire for a product that promises increased energy and confidence.
