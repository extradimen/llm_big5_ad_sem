**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive and interesting. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I don't think it's a *great* advertisement overall.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea, I'm still on the fence about actually buying it. I'd likely try it once (score 2), but whether I'll consider making it a regular purchase depends on things like price and reviews (score 3). My tendency to worry might make me overthink the potential downsides.
