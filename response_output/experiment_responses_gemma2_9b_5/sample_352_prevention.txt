**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't personally like the way it tries to create fear by saying you might feel tired and look dull without the drink (1). It feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me curious enough to try the product (2) and I might even consider buying it if I see positive reviews or someone I trust recommends it (3). However, I'm not immediately rushing to purchase it (1). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
