**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values originality and doesn't prioritize "looking your best" every day, I might be inclined to try this product based on curiosity (intend to purchase). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (try to buy), and ultimately my decision would depend on other factors like reviews and price.  I'd consider buying it if it were part of a larger promotion or bundle deal.
