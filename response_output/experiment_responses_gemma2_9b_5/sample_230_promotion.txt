**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem attractive. The language is common and doesn't stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking better appeals to me, though I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without trying it first. I would consider buying it if I found it effective. 


My personality traits like being talkative, reserved, trusting, and prone to worry might influence my reaction to this ad.  I'm likely to be cautious (due to worrying) but open to trying new things that promise benefits.
