**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at creating a sense of urgency, I don't personally find it attractive. The "prevention" angle plays on my tendency to worry, but  I am generally trusting and tend not to be swayed by fear tactics easily. 

The ad makes me curious enough to try the product, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely consider buying it if I were facing a situation where I felt tired or needed a boost of energy. However, my preference is for healthier alternatives, so the actual purchase depends on other factors like price and ingredient list.
