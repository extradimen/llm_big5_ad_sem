**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it. It relies on a common fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") which feels a bit manipulative to me.  I'm not drawn to its attractiveness either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately. I would likely consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or looking for a boost.  However, I'd probably research other options and compare them before making a decision.
