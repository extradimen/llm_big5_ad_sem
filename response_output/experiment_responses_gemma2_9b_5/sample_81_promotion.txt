**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language is generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad alone.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its taste, ingredients, and price. I might consider buying it depending on factors like promotions or recommendations from friends.
