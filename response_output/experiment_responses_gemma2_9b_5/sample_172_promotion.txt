**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appealing to a desire for energy and appearance improvement, I don't find it particularly "like-able" or "attractive". The language feels generic and doesn't stand out. It's interesting enough to warrant a second glance, but not something I'd consider "good" overall. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am prone to getting nervous and worry, so the promise of feeling energized might be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* or *try* to buy it immediately. I would likely *consider* it depending on factors like price, reviews, and if it came recommended by someone I trust. My lack of outgoingness means I'm less influenced by advertising that aims for immediate action.
