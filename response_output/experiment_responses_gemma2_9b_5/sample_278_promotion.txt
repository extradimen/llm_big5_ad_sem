**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and somewhat good (score of 2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (score of 1). The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and not something I personally prioritize.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product (score of 1) because the promise of energy is appealing, especially considering my tendency to get nervous and worry a lot. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score of 1). Before buying, I would need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust (score of 3). 


My personality traits, such as being talkative and sociable but also cautious and prone to worry, influence my response to the ad. I'm open to trying new things but need convincing through reliable information and social proof.
