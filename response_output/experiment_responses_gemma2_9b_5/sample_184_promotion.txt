**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims are common in advertising for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product initially because the concept appeals to me â€“ staying energized and looking good aligns with my ambition. However, I would need to see more about the specific ingredients and benefits before fully committing to a purchase (hence the "consider" score for the third intention).
