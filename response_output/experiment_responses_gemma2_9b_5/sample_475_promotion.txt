**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing (score of 4 for "attractive"), it's not exceptionally captivating. The message is clear and straightforward, which I appreciate (scores of 3 for "like" and "good"). I find it interesting enough to warrant a second glance (score of 2 for "interesting").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest, so I'd likely give the product a try (score of 2 for "try"). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it right away. A higher score (1 for "intend") might come after more research or seeing testimonials. It's definitely on my radar to consider (score of 3 for "consider").
