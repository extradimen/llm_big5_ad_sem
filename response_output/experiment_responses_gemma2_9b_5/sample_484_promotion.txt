**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its message across, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough to pay attention to, but not something I'd go out of my way to remember or share.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, even though the ad isn't particularly compelling. My active imagination might lead me to envision how this drink could help me in various situations.
