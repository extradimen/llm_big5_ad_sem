**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright (1). I would likely consider it (3) if I was looking for a drink that provided energy and perhaps saw positive reviews or testimonials.  


**Reasoning:**

As someone who is reserved and tends to get nervous easily, generic claims about feeling energized and looking your best don't particularly resonate with me. I prefer more specific information about the product's ingredients and benefits. The ad's reliance on vague promises doesn't inspire strong confidence in its effectiveness.
