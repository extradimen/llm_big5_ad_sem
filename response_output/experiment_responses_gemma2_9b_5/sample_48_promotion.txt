**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me or grab my attention visually. The language is fairly generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product due to its claimed benefits of energy and appearance enhancement. However, I wouldn't make a definite purchase decision without further research or information about the ingredients and potential side effects. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
