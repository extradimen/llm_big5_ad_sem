**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat generic ("energized and look your best"), it's appealing enough to consider interesting (2) and good (3). It's not something that grabs my attention strongly or makes me think it's particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Since I am a blue-collar worker with a focus on practicality, an ad promising energy and looks doesn't directly appeal to my needs. However, the claims are vague enough that I might try the product (1) if given the opportunity. I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it (1) unless there were more specific benefits highlighted for someone in my line of work. 


Let me know if you'd like me to evaluate another ad!
