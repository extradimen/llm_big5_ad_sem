**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly "grab" me or seem very attractive. The message relies on a common fear tactic which I find a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my fears (feeling tired and looking dull), I might consider trying this product. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  My personality leans towards being original and coming up with new ideas, so I'd likely research other options or explore healthier alternatives before making a decision.
