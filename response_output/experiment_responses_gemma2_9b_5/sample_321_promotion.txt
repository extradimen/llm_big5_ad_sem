**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't really grab my attention.  The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and don't appeal to me personally.  My tendency to be cautious and not trust marketing claims (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting") makes me less likely to jump on the bandwagon. 

However, because I do value staying healthy and feeling my best, I might give this product a try if I saw it available or if there was more specific information about its ingredients and benefits that resonated with me.
