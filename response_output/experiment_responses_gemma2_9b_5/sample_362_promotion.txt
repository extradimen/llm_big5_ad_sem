**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad. (4):** While it's a bit generic, the simple message and focus on positive outcomes ("energized," "look your best") are appealing. 

* **I think the ad is interesting. (3):** It's not particularly groundbreaking, but it does pique my curiosity enough to want to learn more about the drink.
* **I believe the ad is good. (2):**  It's functional and conveys its message clearly, but lacks any real "wow" factor or unique selling point. 

* **I find the ad attractive. (3):** The imagery and wording are pleasant enough, but I wouldn't say it's visually stunning or particularly memorable.

* **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  I'm likely to give it a try based on the ad alone, but I need more information about the drink itself before making a firm commitment. 
* **I will try to buy this product. (2):**  If I see it in the store or come across a better deal, I'd be inclined to purchase it.

* **I will consider buying this product. (3):** There are many other similar drinks on the market, so my decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and availability. 



As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot, the ad's promise of feeling "energized" and looking "your best" might appeal to me as a way to manage those feelings. However, I'm also cautious and would need more information before making a purchase.
