**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's presented well, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it seems like something that could be helpful. However, I'm not immediately planning on buying it. There needs to be more convincing information for me to commit to a purchase. 



Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
