**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at creating concern (good), I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative and lacks originality.  It's not attractive to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or concerned about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be determined to buy it. The ad doesn't really resonate with me on a deeper level.
