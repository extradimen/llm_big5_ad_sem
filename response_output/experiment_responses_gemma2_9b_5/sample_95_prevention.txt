This ad plays on my insecurities by associating tiredness and dullness with negative aspects. While I find the message somewhat interesting and a decent advertisement overall, I wouldn't necessarily be convinced to buy the product based solely on this claim.  I'd probably give it a try if I was feeling particularly tired or looking for a new drink option.
