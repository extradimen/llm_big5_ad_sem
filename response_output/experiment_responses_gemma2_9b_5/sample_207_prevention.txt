**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on my fear of looking dull (which can make me nervous), I don't particularly like it. It feels manipulative and I don't trust claims made without evidence.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying the product, but I wouldn't immediately buy it. I'd likely need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.  The possibility of feeling less tired is appealing, as my nervousness often stems from fatigue.
