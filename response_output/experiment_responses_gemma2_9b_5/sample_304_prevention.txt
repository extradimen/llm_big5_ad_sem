Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (it plays on common anxieties) and believe it's somewhat good in its simplicity, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my personality traits (reserved, sometimes careless), the ad does spark a slight worry about looking dull. This makes me more likely to *consider* buying the product. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately or even actively *try* it. I need more information about the drink and its effectiveness before making a purchase decision.
