**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance (something important to a young professional), it doesn't quite grab my attention as "highly interesting" or "extremely attractive." The simplicity of the message feels a bit lacking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. My decision would heavily depend on factors like price, reviews, and seeing it in person.
