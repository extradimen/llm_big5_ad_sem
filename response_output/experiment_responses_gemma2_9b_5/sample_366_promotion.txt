Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it very attractive. It doesn't grab my attention in a way that makes me want to learn more about the product.  
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this drink because of the promise of feeling energized. However, I wouldn't immediately run out and buy it. The ad alone isn't convincing enough for me to make a purchase decision right away. I might need to see more information or reviews before deciding. 


As a blue-collar worker with limited income, I am always looking for ways to feel my best throughout the day.  But I'm also cautious about spending money on things that don't deliver what they promise.
