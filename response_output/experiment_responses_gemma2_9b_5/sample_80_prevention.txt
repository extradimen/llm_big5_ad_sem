**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The focus on "looking dull" feels a bit shallow and manipulative, which is why my scores for "like" and "attractive" are lower. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product ("consider"). However, as someone who tends to be careful ("Strongly Disagree - I tend to be careless"), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it ("intend" and "try" scores are lower).  I'd likely want to research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
