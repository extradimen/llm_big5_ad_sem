**Explanation:**

While I find the ad intriguing and somewhat well-constructed, I wouldn't call it "attractive."  The fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") resonates with my tendency to worry and get nervous easily. However, my reserved nature and distrust of quick solutions would make me hesitant to immediately purchase the product.  

I'd likely try it out based on the ad alone, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term. My careful consideration (scoring "consider") stems from my tendency to analyze situations thoroughly before committing.
