**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly good or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I would be inclined to try this product because of the fear-based appeal. The ad makes me think about how I want to appear to others, and the promise of looking more vibrant is tempting. 
    * I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately without trying it first.  
    * I might consider buying it if I found the taste acceptable and felt it genuinely made a difference.
