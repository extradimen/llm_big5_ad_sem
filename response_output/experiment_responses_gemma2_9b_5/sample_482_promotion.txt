**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product. While I might not immediately buy it, I would consider giving it a shot if I saw it at a store. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me.  It suggests a way to feel more confident and in control. However, the ad is fairly generic and doesn't offer any specific details about the product that would make me immediately want to buy it.  The lack of specifics makes me hesitant to fully commit to purchasing.
