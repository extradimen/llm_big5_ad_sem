**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simple message about energy and appearance is intriguing enough to catch my attention.
    * **3 (Good):**  While it's not a particularly creative ad, it effectively conveys its message in a concise way. 
    * **2 (Like):** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in the sense of finding it particularly enjoyable, but it's not off-putting either.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable, so I wouldn't find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** Given my personality and income level, I'm likely to purchase this product if I see it in a store or online. 
    * **1 (Try):**  I'd be willing to give the drink a try, especially if there was a promotional offer.
    * **2 (Consider):** While I'm inclined to buy it, I wouldn't actively seek it out without a reason like a discount or recommendation.
