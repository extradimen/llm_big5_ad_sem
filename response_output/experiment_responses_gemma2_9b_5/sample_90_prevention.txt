**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing and believe it presents a clear benefit (feeling less tired and looking more vibrant), I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product.  The ad has piqued my interest enough to want to see if it delivers on its promise. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it immediately. I would need to see more information about the product's ingredients, potential side effects, and user reviews before making a firm decision.
