**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and pleasant ("good", "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of  "stay energized and look your best" appeals to me, so I am likely to try the product.   I might even intend to purchase it if there's a promotion or if I see positive reviews from people I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
