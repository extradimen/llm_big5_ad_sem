**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): This is low because the ad doesn't convince me of any real benefit. It simply creates a problem ("feeling tired and looking dull") without offering much in the way of solution.
    * I will try to buy this product (1): Again, relatively low.  I might be tempted to try it out of curiosity, but it wouldn't be a high priority purchase.
    * I will consider buying this product (3): This is the highest score because I could see myself considering it if I were feeling particularly stressed or worried about my appearance, and the ad appealed to those anxieties. 



My personality as a cautious and somewhat anxious individual makes me less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals like this ad uses.  I would need more concrete information about the product's benefits before making a purchase decision.
