}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad message appealing because it speaks to common desires for energy and looking good. However, I don't find it particularly innovative or groundbreaking. The simplicity of the message makes it memorable but not necessarily "attractive" in a visually stunning way. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  While the message resonates with me, I am likely to try this product based on the promise of increased energy and a better appearance. I wouldn't automatically buy it without trying it first. However, if I have a positive experience, I would definitely consider making repeat purchases.
