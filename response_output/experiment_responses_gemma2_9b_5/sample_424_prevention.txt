**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.  The "prevention" framing also doesn't resonate strongly with my personality (reserved but trusting).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was genuinely concerned about feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be inclined to purchase it based solely on this ad.
