**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd probably consider buying it depending on other factors like price and reviews. 


My personality traits, such as being reserved, trusting issues, worry, and nervousness, might lead me to be more cautious about trying new things, especially if the ad relies on fear tactics.
