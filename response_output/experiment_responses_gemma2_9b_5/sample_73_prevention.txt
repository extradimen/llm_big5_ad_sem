**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good (it's simple and gets a point across), I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The language used isn't overly engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my fear of looking dull and feeling tired, I am likely to try this product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further information about its taste and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
