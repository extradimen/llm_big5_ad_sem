**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to get my attention. However, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me visually or emotionally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might be tempted to *try* this drink out of curiosity, my  "careless" nature (as described in my profile) means I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly. The ad itself might influence me to consider it, but ultimately I'd need more information about its taste and benefits before making a firm decision.
