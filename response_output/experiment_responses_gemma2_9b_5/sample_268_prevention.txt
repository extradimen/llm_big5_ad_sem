**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and attractive because it plays on my desire to look and feel my best, I'm not easily swayed by claims of looking "dull." I need more concrete information about the drink's benefits and how it works.  The "prevention" angle makes me think it addresses a potential problem, which is appealing, but I'd want to research further before committing to a purchase.
