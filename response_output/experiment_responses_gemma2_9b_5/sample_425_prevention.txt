**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly engaging, the ad's straightforward message about tiredness and dullness piques my curiosity. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad raises a relatable concern – feeling tired and looking dull – which I think many people can connect with.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets its point across clearly, but lacks any real creativity or memorability.
    * **Attractive (1):** The simplicity of the message doesn't make it particularly visually appealing or enticing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad itself isn't compelling enough to make me immediately want to buy the product. I need more information about the drink and its benefits.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the product if I saw it in a store or heard positive reviews from people I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has planted a seed of thought, so I would definitely consider buying it if I found myself needing an energy boost or feeling self-conscious about my appearance.
