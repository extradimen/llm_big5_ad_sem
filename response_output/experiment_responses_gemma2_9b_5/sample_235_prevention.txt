**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to at least try the product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking better. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
