Explanation:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") are common and don't stand out as unique or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my personality traits (reserved, sometimes rude, original, active imagination), I'm more likely to be skeptical of mainstream advertising. However, the ad is intriguing enough that I might give the product a try.  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it, but I'd consider it if presented with an opportunity or if I saw positive reviews from people whose opinions I value.
