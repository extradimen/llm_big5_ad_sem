**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly exciting or engaging, but it's not bad either.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of energy and looking your best is somewhat appealing, though not groundbreaking.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent advertisement, clear in its message, but lacks something memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually or conceptually grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately rushing to buy this drink. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if I saw it on sale or was curious.
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on factors like price, reviews, and personal need for energy, I could see myself buying it in the future.



My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to jump into trying a new product without more information.  I value trustworthiness and would likely look for reviews or recommendations before making a purchase. The ad's focus on "looking your best" doesn't strongly resonate with my personality, as I prioritize inner qualities over outward appearance.
