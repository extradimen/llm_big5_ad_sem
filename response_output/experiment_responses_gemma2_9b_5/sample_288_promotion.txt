**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking better does appeal to me, so I would probably try the product.  However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. There are likely other factors (like price, reviews, availability) that would influence my final decision.   


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
