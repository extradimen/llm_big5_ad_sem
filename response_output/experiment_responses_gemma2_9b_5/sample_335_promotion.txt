**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to the "energized" aspect appealing to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I had a positive experience trying it. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
