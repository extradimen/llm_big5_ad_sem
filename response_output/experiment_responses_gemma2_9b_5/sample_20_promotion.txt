**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out. I wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product due to the appeal of staying energized and looking my best. However, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
