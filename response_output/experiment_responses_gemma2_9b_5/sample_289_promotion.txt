**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets its message across. I don't find it particularly compelling, but it's not unpleasant either.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is relatable, though not unique. It piques my curiosity slightly.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is clear and concise. However, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would draw me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** While the promise is appealing, I'm hesitant to commit to buying based solely on this ad.  I'd need more information about the product and its ingredients. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try the drink if it was offered at a discount or I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects that I wouldn't immediately dismiss the product. If I needed a boost of energy or was looking for a new beverage, I'd probably consider giving it a try. 



My personality traits, such as being reserved and getting nervous easily, might make me less likely to be swayed by typical marketing tactics. I also tend to be helpful and unselfish, so I might be more inclined to consider the product's ethical and environmental impact before making a purchase.
