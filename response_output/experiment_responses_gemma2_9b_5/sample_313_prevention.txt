**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's good in its attempt to create a desired outcome (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (score 1).  I'm not easily swayed by fear-based marketing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me somewhat curious about the product (intend to purchase, score 1) and willing to try it (try to buy, score 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it without further research or positive reviews (consider buying, score 3).


As someone who tends to be reserved and worries a lot,  ads playing on fear tactics ("look dull") don't usually resonate with me strongly. My active imagination might make me visualize the negative outcomes, but my cautious nature would likely lead to more research before making a purchase.
