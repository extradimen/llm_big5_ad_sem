**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look good), it doesn't particularly "grab" me. It feels a bit generic and common.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be a planner and trust what I see, this ad makes me want to at least try the product. The promise of feeling better and looking better aligns with my desire to be active and sociable.
