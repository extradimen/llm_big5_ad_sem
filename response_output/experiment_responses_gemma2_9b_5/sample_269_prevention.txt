**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not loving the ad, I might consider trying the product (3) out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1) or make a conscious effort to buy it (1). The ad doesn't inspire strong confidence in the product's effectiveness.  My tendency to be careless (strongly agree) might lead me to forget about trying it, and my worry (agree) could make me second-guess its potential benefits.
