**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad (3):** It's a simple message that gets the point across. While not overly creative, it does grab attention.
    * **I think the ad is interesting (2):**  It's not particularly novel or groundbreaking, but it sparks some curiosity about the product's benefits.
    * **I believe the ad is good (4):** It effectively uses fear-based messaging ("Without this drink...") to potentially motivate a purchase. 
    * **I find the ad attractive (1):**  The language is functional rather than visually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product (1):** The ad alone isn't enough to make me buy it. I'd need more information about the product and its benefits.
    * **I will try to buy this product (1):**  Similar to above, I'm not immediately inclined to buy but might consider it if I saw it in a store or received more details.
    * **I will consider buying this product (3):**  The ad raises my awareness of the product and potentially its benefits. Depending on other factors like price and reviews, I could be swayed towards trying it. 



As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I'd want to research more about the drink before making a purchase decision. The ad's appeal lies in its simplicity and ability to raise questions, but it lacks the persuasive power to convince me on its own.
