**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at promoting the drink, I don't personally find it particularly *likable* or *attractive*. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might *intend to purchase* it and definitely *try* it. However, I wouldn't say I'm strongly inclined to buy it right away (hence the "consider" score).  My reserved nature means I need more convincing before committing to a purchase.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
