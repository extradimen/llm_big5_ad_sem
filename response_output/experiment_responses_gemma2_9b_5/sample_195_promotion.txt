**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally like the wording or find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the promise of energy and appearance benefits, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a firm decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
