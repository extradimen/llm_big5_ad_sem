**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. It relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my favorite approach. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might *try* the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. There needs to be more convincing evidence for me to consider it a necessity in my life.
