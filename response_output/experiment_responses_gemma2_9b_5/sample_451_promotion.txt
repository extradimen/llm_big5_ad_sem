**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or seeing if someone else has tried it first.   I'm open to considering it depending on other factors like price and reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
