**Explanation:**

While the ad uses simple and appealing language ("stay energized," "look your best"), I'm not easily persuaded by such general claims. My tendency to be careless and worry a lot might make me hesitant to try new products without more specific information about their ingredients and effects.  I might consider buying it if there were testimonials or scientific evidence backing up the claims.
