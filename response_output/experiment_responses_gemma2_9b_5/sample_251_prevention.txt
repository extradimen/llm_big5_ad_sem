**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a common fear-based tactic (feeling tired and dull), I find it slightly manipulative.  The message is simple and gets attention, but I don't find it particularly creative or well-executed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because I am generally trusting and tend to worry about appearing tired. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research. I would likely "try" it if given a sample or discount.
