**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad.** (2) - While not particularly captivating, it's straightforward and gets the point across. I find the promise of energy and looking good appealing.

* **I think the ad is interesting.** (3) - The simplicity of the message makes it memorable, but it lacks any truly unique or intriguing elements. 
* **I believe the ad is good.** (2) - It effectively communicates its core message without being overly complicated. However, I wouldn't consider it a particularly "good" ad in terms of creativity or originality.
* **I find the ad attractive.** (1) - The ad's visuals and language are functional but not particularly appealing to me.

* **I intend to purchase this product.** (1) -  The ad piques my interest, but I need more information about the drink itself before making a purchase decision.
* **I will try to buy this product.** (1) - Similar to intending to purchase,  further research and possibly seeing it in stores would be necessary before I commit to buying. 
* **I will consider buying this product.** (3) - Given my tendency to trust advertising and the promise of feeling energized and looking better, I'd at least consider trying the drink if the opportunity arose.
