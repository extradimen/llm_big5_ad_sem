**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad decent but not particularly remarkable. It's appealing enough to draw my attention (interesting and attractive), but it doesn't stand out as exceptional or memorable (like and good).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product,  as the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire for well-being. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to purchase it. I'd likely try it first to see if it lives up to its claims.
