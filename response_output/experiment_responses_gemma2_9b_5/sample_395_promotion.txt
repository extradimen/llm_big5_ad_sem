**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel vague ("stay energized," "look your best") and don't resonate with my personality traits (I tend to be reserved and worry a lot). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * **Intend:** I might consider buying this product if I see it on sale or if there are testimonials from people I trust. 
    * **Try:** My anxiety about trusting products and my tendency to be careless make me hesitant to try something new, especially in a category like drinks where there are so many options.
    * **Consider:** The possibility of feeling energized and looking better is appealing, but it's not strong enough to outweigh my reservations.
