**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad, gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (2):** Not particularly captivating, but I've seen worse.
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively conveys the product's benefits.
    * **Attractive (2):** The wording is simple and straightforward, but not particularly eye-catching.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy it. If I need an energy boost and see this drink readily available, I might choose it.
    * **Try (1):** I'd definitely give it a shot.  I like trying new things, especially if they promise an energy boost. 
    * **Consider (3):** There are plenty of other drinks out there, so I wouldn't necessarily prioritize this one.
