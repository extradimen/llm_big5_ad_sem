**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *decent*, it doesn't particularly *grab* my attention or make me think highly of it. The language is a bit generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me, so I would likely *try* the product. However, without more specific information about its ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't be fully committed to buying it outright. The "consider" score reflects that I might purchase it if there were a good sale or recommendation from someone I trust. 


My reserved personality means I'm not easily swayed by advertising.  I need more concrete information before making a purchasing decision.
