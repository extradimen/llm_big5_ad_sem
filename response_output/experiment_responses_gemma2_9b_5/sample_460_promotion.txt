**Explanation:**

While I find the ad appealing and interesting, my high worry levels make me hesitant to purchase a product solely based on an advertisement's claims. I'd likely try it once, but wouldn't commit to purchasing it until I'd personally experienced its effects and determined if the benefits actually live up to the advertising.  My blue-collar background also might lead me to prioritize practical needs over aspirational ones implied by "looking your best."
