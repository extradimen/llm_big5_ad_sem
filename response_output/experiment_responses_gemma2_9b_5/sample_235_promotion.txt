**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, but it's a common message.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic point across clearly enough. 
    * **Attractive (1):** Not particularly visually appealing or memorable to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider it if I was really looking for a boost, but there are probably other options I'd try first.
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't actively seek this out, but if someone offered me a sample, I might give it a go. 
    * **Consider (2):** If the price was right and I was running low on energy, I could see myself buying it.


My personality traits influence my response:

* **High value on practicality:**  I'm more likely to be swayed by tangible benefits than vague claims about looking good. 
* **Skepticism:** My distrustfulness makes me less likely to believe promises without concrete evidence.
* **Emotional stability:** I'm not easily influenced by emotional appeals in advertising.
