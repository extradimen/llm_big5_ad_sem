**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or likable.  The claims are common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I worry a lot (as my personality traits indicate), I tend to be cautious about new products. While I might try the drink, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I'd likely research more and see if there are reviews or information about its ingredients before making a decision.
