**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad simple and somewhat appealing (scores of 3 for "like" and "good"), it doesn't really grab my attention or stand out as particularly creative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *do* think I'd try this product based on the ad's claims.  I like the idea of staying energized, but I wouldn't necessarily buy it without trying it first. It might depend on price and availability too. The "consider" score reflects that I wouldn't rush to purchase it without further information.
