Here's a breakdown of my thinking:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises energy and good looks, things that appeal to young people like me. While I don't think it's particularly *good* or *attractive*, it does capture my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because of the promise of feeling energized. I also might *try* it since I'm sociable and enjoy trying new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it long-term without knowing more about its ingredients and effects. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
