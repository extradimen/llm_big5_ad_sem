  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. It feels a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad mentions "staying energized" and "looking your best,"  it appeals to my desire to improve myself. So, while I wouldn't immediately buy it, I would consider trying it and might even intend to purchase it depending on other factors like price and reviews.
