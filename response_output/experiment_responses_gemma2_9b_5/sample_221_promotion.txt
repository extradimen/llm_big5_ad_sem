**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it lacks a specific hook that would make me strongly agree with its quality or attractiveness. The focus on appearance over other benefits might also be off-putting to some, myself included.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because I like the general idea of staying energized. However, I'd need more information about the ingredients and benefits beyond just "looking your best" before committing to purchasing regularly.
