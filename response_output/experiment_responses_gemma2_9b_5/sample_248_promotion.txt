**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at promotion, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *likeable*.  The language is fairly common and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:** The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the product, so I might buy it if I saw it at a store.
    * **Try to buy:** My level of interest is moderate.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if it was readily available and convenient, I'd give it a shot.
    * **Consider buying:** Given my personality (reserved, somewhat nervous, prone to worry), a drink promising energy and improved appearance might appeal to me as a way to feel more confident.
