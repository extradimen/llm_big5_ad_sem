**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. Considering the purchase depends on factors like price, reviews, and how much I trust the brand. My tendency to be careless could lead me to forget about trying it, while my worry and nervousness might make me hesitant to commit to a new product.
