**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't necessarily "bad," it doesn't particularly appeal to me. I find it a bit uninteresting and predictable. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is something I don't personally relate to strongly, so the ad doesn't resonate. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad doesn't grab my attention or make me feel like I *need* this drink, I wouldn't immediately buy it. However, if I saw it again and was looking for a beverage, I might consider trying it.  It's not something I would actively seek out.
