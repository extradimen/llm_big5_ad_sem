**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly *like* or feel *attractive* to me.  The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might *try* this product. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it. There's a chance I would *consider* buying it depending on other factors like price and brand reputation.
