**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The message is simple and common.
    * **Interesting (3):** There's nothing inherently uninteresting about the ad, but it doesn't spark much curiosity either. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets its point across clearly enough.  
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based solely on the ad, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try the drink if I saw it in a store and was looking for something new.
    * **Consider (2):** If friends recommended it or there were testimonials that sounded credible, I would give it more serious consideration.



My personality traits influence these scores:

* **Reserved:** The ad's straightforwardness doesn't appeal to my need for something more unique or thought-provoking.
* **Helpful and Unselfish:** While the ad focuses on personal benefits, it doesn't highlight any social good or positive impact, which might be important to me.
* **Trusting (Lack of):**  The ad makes general claims without specifics, so I'd need more evidence before believing it.
* **Original and Imaginative (Neutral):** The ad isn't particularly creative, which doesn't bother me or excite me.
