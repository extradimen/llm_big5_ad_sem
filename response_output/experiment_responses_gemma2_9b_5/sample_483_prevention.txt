**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me because it appeals to my desire to look and feel my best. However, I don't find it particularly charming or enjoyable to watch.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull piques my curiosity. It plays on a fear I have about aging and not maintaining a youthful appearance.
    * **Good (2):** The ad is straightforward in its message and uses simple language, which I appreciate. However, it lacks creativity and originality. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or memorable. It relies on a common fear tactic rather than showcasing the product's unique qualities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try this drink because of my interest in looking and feeling youthful.
    * **Try (1):** The "prevention" angle appeals to me, suggesting that it can help avoid negative outcomes associated with aging.  
    * **Consider (3):** While I might consider purchasing the product, I would need more information about its ingredients, potential side effects, and effectiveness before making a final decision.



As someone who values thoroughness and tends to be cautious, I wouldn't blindly purchase this product based solely on the ad.  I'd want to research it further and perhaps seek recommendations from others before committing.
