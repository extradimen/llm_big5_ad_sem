**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message straightforward and easy to understand. It appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are relatable goals. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad appealing, I'm hesitant to commit fully to purchasing. 
    * "Intend to purchase" reflects that if I saw this product at a reasonable price and needed an energy boost, I might buy it.
    * "Try to buy" suggests I'd be willing to give it a shot based on the ad alone. 
    *  "Consider buying" acknowledges that other factors like price, availability, and personal preferences would ultimately influence my decision.
