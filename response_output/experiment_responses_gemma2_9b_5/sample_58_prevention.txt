**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" framing (without this, you may feel tired) can be effective, but I'm not easily swayed by such claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. My decision would heavily depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal experience with similar products. 



My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me cautious about trying new things, even if advertised as beneficial.
