**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity. However, my  initial intention isn't strong, and I would need to see more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before seriously considering purchasing it regularly. 



As someone who values being thorough and original, I would want to research alternative options and not solely rely on this advertisement's claims.
