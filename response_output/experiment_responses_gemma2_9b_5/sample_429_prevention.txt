**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it highlights a potential problem (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't find it particularly attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink..."). However, my tendency to worry (agree) makes me consider the possibility that I *might* feel tired and look dull if I don't use this product. This, combined with my helpful and unselfish nature, might lead me to try it once to see if it helps.
