**Explanation:**

While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable* or *attractive*, I do think it's interesting and reasonably well-made. The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me on a basic level.  However, my personality traits suggest I wouldn't be overly invested in following through with a purchase (I'm not big on planning or thoroughness). That said,  given the ad's message and my tendency to trust, I could see myself trying the product at least once.
