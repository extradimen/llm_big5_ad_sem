**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product. Because the claims are general ("stay energized", "look your best"), I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away, but I would likely consider it if I saw it in a store and was looking for an energy boost or something to help with my appearance.
