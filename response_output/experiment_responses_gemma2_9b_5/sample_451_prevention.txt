**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with my values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it claims to combat tiredness. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if it received good reviews or if a friend recommended it.
