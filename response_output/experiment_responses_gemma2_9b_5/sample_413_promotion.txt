**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't call it particularly interesting or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am somewhat likely to try this product based on the ad. The claim of increased energy appeals to me, but I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.
