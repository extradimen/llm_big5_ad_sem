**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it attractive. The  "prevention" angle plays on my worries (I worry a lot) but the  claim feels hyperbolic and lacks credibility. 

Despite this, because I am generally trusting and helpful, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity or a desire to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out or intending to purchase it based solely on this ad.
