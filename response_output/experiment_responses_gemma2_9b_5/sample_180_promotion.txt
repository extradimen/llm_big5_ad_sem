**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and to the point, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It's not bad, just not something that stands out as exceptional.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and tend to be careless, I might impulsively buy this drink based on the promise of feeling energized. However, I would likely only try it once before deciding if it's worth purchasing regularly.
