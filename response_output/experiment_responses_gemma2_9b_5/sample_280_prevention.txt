This ad plays on my fear of appearing dull and tired, which is a valid concern for someone who wants to make a good impression. While I don't necessarily like the over-the-top language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), I find it interesting because it speaks to a common insecurity.  It's not necessarily "good" advertising, but it does grab my attention.   


I'm likely to try the product based on curiosity, but I wouldn't say I'm fully committed to purchasing it.
