**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "you may feel tired and look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would probably need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
