**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit general and not very specific to make me excited about it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad piqued my interest somewhat, I might try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I'd definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or learned more about its benefits.
