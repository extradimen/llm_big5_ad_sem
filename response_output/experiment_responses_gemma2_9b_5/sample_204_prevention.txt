**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, it doesn't particularly excite me. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, so I find the ad somewhat interesting.
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of conveying a potential problem and hinting at a solution. However, it lacks creativity or depth.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's visuals and wording aren't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it if I saw it in a store and was feeling particularly tired or needed a pick-me-up.
    * **Consider (3):**  If there were more information about the product's benefits, ingredients, or how it works, I would be more likely to consider purchasing it.



As someone who values helpfulness and trustworthiness, I'd need more information about the product before making a decision. The ad's focus on negative feelings ("tired" and "dull") doesn't resonate strongly with my personality.
