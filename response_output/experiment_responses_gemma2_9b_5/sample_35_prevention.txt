**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good at conveying its message, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (reserved, tends to be careless, worries a lot), I'm likely to be influenced by the ad's message. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I might try it once if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about how I looked.  I wouldn't automatically consider buying it on a regular basis though.
