**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull"), it does catch my attention because of its strong imagery.  The bold claim makes me curious and interested in learning more. The word "dull" also plays on insecurities that might appeal to someone like me who values being outgoing and sociable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite the ad's persuasiveness, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. My high score on "try" indicates that I'd likely give it a shot if it was offered for free or at a discount, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
