**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (3) and believe it has some merit (3), I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive".  The language feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product (1) because it appeals to my desire for energy and vitality. I also intend to try it (1) due to my trusting nature and willingness to experiment with new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without trying it first (2).
