**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I like the ad: **3** - It's not particularly captivating, but it gets the message across clearly.
    * I think the ad is interesting: **2** -  It's a fairly standard advertisement with common claims. Not very unique or surprising.
    * I believe the ad is good: **3** - It's well-constructed and uses simple language, which makes it easy to understand.
    * I find the ad attractive: **2** - The ad isn't visually stimulating or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product: **1** -  The claims are vague ("stay energized," "look your best") and don't convince me to buy. 
    * I will try to buy this product: **1** -  I might consider it if there was a trial offer or if I needed an energy boost.
    * I will consider buying this product: **2** - The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might think about it, especially if it's advertised at a good price or in a place where I frequently shop.



As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, I would also be cautious about supporting products that make broad health claims without providing specific evidence.
