**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me (1), I find it interesting (2) and think it's a decent advertisement (2).  The message is clear and speaks to common desires for energy and looking good. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I agree with the statement, "I tend to be careless," I'm more likely to try this product (1), rather than definitively intending to buy it (1). However, I might consider buying it (3) depending on other factors like price and availability.
