**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's good. While not unattractive, I don't find it particularly appealing visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad sparks my interest enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't actively go out of my way to purchase it right now. The claims about energy and appearance are somewhat vague, so I'd want to learn more before committing to a buy. 


My personality traits like being reserved and nervous likely make me less impulsive in purchasing decisions.  The ad needs to provide more specific details or benefits that directly address my concerns to increase my purchase intention.
