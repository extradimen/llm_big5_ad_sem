**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* to some extent, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my personal values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to purchase the product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly unless there were specific reasons or if it truly delivered on its energy claims.
