**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider purchasing the product because of its focus on potential negative consequences ("tired," "dull"). However, I'm not immediately convinced to try it or intend to buy it right away. My reserved nature and tendency to worry might lead me to research alternatives or be cautious about making a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
