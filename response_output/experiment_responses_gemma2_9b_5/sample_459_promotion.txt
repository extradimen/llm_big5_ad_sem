**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or convincing. The language is common in ads for energy drinks, so it doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be easily influenced by social cues and like new things,  I would likely purchase this drink based on the ad alone. However, my "careless" nature might lead me to forget about it or try something else before actually buying it.
