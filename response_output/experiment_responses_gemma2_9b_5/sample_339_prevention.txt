**Explanation:**

While the ad plays on my fears (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't find it particularly appealing. The wording feels a bit manipulative, which makes me hesitant. However, the idea of not feeling tired is tempting, so I might consider trying the product.  I wouldn't be enthusiastic about buying it based on this ad alone.
