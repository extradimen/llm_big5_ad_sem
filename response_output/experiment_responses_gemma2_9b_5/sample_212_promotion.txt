**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly captivating. The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, but it's a common theme in many advertisements.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the claim of increased energy appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
