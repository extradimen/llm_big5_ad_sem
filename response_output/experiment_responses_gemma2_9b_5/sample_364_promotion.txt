**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to try the product out of curiosity. I would also *try* it, but I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly. My personality leans towards being cautious and not easily swayed by advertising. The promise of "looking your best" doesn't hold much weight for me personally.
