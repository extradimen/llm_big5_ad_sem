**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it highly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic ("look dull") which isn't very appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product.  The ad appeals to my desire to be perceived as energetic and successful, even though the logic is weak. The high income bracket I belong to might also make me more susceptible to marketing messages that associate products with status and image.
