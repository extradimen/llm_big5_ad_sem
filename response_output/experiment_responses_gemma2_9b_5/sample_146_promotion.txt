**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something tangible (energy and looking good). However, I don't find it particularly attractive or necessarily "good." It feels like a common marketing tactic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it could be helpful for my work. I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and its actual effectiveness.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
