**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive and interesting, I don't think it's exceptionally good. The language is fairly common and doesn't stand out as particularly creative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "looking your best" appeals to my desire for success in my work. However, I would likely try the product first to see if it delivers on its promise before committing to regular purchases. 



My personality traits, like being talkative and original, might lead me to share my experience with colleagues if I find the drink effective. My tendency to be careless could mean I forget to purchase it regularly unless it becomes a habit.
