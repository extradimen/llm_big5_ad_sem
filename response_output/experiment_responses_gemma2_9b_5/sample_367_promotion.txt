Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and to the point, I find it somewhat appealing because it directly addresses two things that are important to me: energy levels and looking good.  I don't find it particularly "good" or "attractive" in a creative sense, but it gets the message across effectively.
* **Purchase Intention:** Since I am outgoing and like to present myself well, staying energized and looking my best is important to me. This ad makes me more likely to try the product. However,  I'm not sure if I would "intend" to buy it without knowing more about its ingredients and effectiveness. The "consider" score reflects that I'd need more information before making a full commitment.
