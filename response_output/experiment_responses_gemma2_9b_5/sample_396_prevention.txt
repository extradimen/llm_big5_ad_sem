**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  The "dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to give the product a try, but I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it based on this alone. My strong belief in being original likely makes me less susceptible to fear-based advertising like this.
