**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common insecurities (feeling tired and dull), I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative and uses fear to try to sell the product.  I also don't find it very attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I would consider buying it if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious, but I wouldn't make it a habit. My personality traits (reserved, nervous, worrying) might lead me to be more susceptible to these kinds of emotional appeals in advertising.
