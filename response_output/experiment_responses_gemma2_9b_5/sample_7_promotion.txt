**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. It lacks a certain depth or personal connection that would make me truly engaged.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, so I'd likely try the product at least once. However, my general preference for not trying new things (agreeing with "make plans and follow through with them") means a full intention to purchase isn't there yet. I'd consider it further after trying it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
