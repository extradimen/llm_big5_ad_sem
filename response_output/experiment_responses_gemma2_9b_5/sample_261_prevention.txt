**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't particularly appealing to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  I'm also likely to try it based on a recommendation from someone I trust rather than solely based on this advertisement.
