**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a positive way, but it does pique my interest (2) because it appeals to a common fear of looking dull.  I think it's a decent ad overall (3), but not particularly attractive or appealing to me (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am somewhat reserved and cautious (strongly agree with "reserved"), the claim that without this drink I might feel tired and look dull worries me enough to make me want to try it (1) and potentially purchase it if I see results (3). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
