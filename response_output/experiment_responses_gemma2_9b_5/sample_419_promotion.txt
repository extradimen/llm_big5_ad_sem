**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't particularly grab my attention (hence the lower scores for "like" and "attractive"), I find it interesting because of its focus on both energy and appearance. The promise of looking your best is appealing,  and the "stay energized" aspect resonates with someone who might be juggling studies at my age.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try this product. Given my income level, I wouldn't hesitate to experiment with a new beverage if it claims to deliver both energy and aesthetic benefits. However, I would likely consider it carefully before committing to regular purchases, as I tend to be thorough in my decision-making (reflecting my "thorough job" trait).
