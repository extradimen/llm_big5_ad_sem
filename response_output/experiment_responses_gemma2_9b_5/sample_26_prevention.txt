**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good at grabbing attention, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or someone I trust recommended it. My high income doesn't necessarily mean I'm easily swayed by advertising; I still value careful consideration before making a purchase.
