**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or actively seek it out. The ad lacks strong persuasive power for me due to its relatively simple and somewhat manipulative message.
