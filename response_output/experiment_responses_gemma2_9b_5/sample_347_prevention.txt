**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate strongly with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider purchasing the product because I'm generally trusting and helpful. If someone recommended it, I might try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or plan to purchase it without further information about its benefits and ingredients.
