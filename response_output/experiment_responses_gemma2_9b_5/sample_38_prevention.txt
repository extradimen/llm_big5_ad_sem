**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing (interesting) and believe it presents a clear point (good), I don't personally find it aesthetically appealing or captivating.  The use of "dull" might come across as slightly harsh, which affects my overall liking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. The ad does make me consider trying it, especially if I'm feeling particularly tired or sluggish.  I wouldn't prioritize buying it over other needs. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
