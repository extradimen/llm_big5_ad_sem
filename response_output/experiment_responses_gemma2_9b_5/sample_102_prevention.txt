**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.  I would need more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision. The "prevention" angle of the ad does appeal to me as someone who values planning and being thorough, but I'm naturally cautious and wouldn't be swayed by emotional appeals alone.
