**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I saw it in a store. I'm not going out of my way to purchase it, but the idea of feeling more energized and looking good appeals to me on some level. The "stay energized" part resonates with my tendency to get nervous easily and worry a lot â€“ perhaps it could help me feel more composed.
