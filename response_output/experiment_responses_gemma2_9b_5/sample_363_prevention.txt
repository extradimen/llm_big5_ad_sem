**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (2)** because it plays on my fear of looking dull and tired. However, it's not something I particularly "like" or find aesthetically pleasing.
    * I think it's a **good ad (3)** because it clearly conveys its message and aims to appeal to my desire for energy and vibrancy. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad is interesting, I wouldn't immediately **intend to purchase (1)** the product.  I'm naturally reserved and cautious, so I need more information before making a decision.
    * I might **try (1)** it if there was a good deal or someone recommended it highly. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider (3)** buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and my perceived need for an energy boost.
