**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I appreciate a good energy boost. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research and perhaps a discount.  I would consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if I was feeling particularly drained. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
