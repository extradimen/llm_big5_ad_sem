**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on my anxieties about looking dull (agree with "I get nervous easily", "I worry a lot"), I wouldn't necessarily like it.  It feels manipulative to me and relies on fear tactics, which I generally dislike ("Sometimes rude" personality trait).

However, given my tendency to worry and the fact that it appeals to those insecurities, I might consider buying the product.  I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it right away.
