**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly attracted to it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might consider purchasing this drink.  I'm more likely to try it than simply intend to buy it right away. However, I wouldn't immediately jump to buying it without further research or seeing if there are similar products available. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
