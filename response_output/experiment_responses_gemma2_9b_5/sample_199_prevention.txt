**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common worries about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly **like (2)** it or find it particularly **good (2)** or **attractive (1)**.  The language feels a bit too strong and manipulative for my taste.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While the ad piques my interest, I would **intend (1) to purchase** the product based on this alone. I'd likely **try (1)** it out of curiosity. However,  I wouldn't necessarily **consider (3)** buying it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 



As a cautious person who worries a lot, I'd need more convincing than just a fear-based ad to make a purchase decision. I'd want to research reviews and perhaps consult with my doctor before trying something new.
