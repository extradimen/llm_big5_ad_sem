  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly eye-catching or exciting (hence low scores for "like" and "attractive"), I find it interesting because it appeals to common desires for energy and looking good. It's also decent in terms of conveying its message clearly. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because the ad makes general claims about energy and appearance, I'm not immediately convinced. However, I might try the product if there was a discount or if someone recommended it to me. Ultimately, I'd consider buying it based on more specific information about ingredients and effectiveness. My anxiety (which is high) might make me hesitant to try new things without solid proof of benefit.
