**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim "helps you stay energized and look your best" appeals to me as a young person who wants to project a positive image. I'd likely try the product at least once based on the advertisement. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or seeing user reviews. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
