**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appealing to someone seeking energy and a good appearance, it lacks originality. The claims are common in this type of advertising, so I find it moderately interesting and decent overall but not particularly attractive or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I'm likely to buy this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire for personal well-being. 
    * **Try to buy:** This is a given as I intend to purchase it.
    * **Consider buying:** While I'm leaning towards buying, there might be other factors influencing my final decision, such as price, brand reputation, and availability.
