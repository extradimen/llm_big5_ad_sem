**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  I think it's a decent ad in terms of its message and simplicity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if I was feeling pressured or lacking energy, I wouldn't actively try to purchase it. I don't usually buy products based on fear tactics or promises of quick fixes.
