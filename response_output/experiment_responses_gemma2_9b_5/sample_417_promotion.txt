**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly *attractive* (score of 1), I find it  *interesting* (3) and believe it's a *good* advertisement (2). It's simple and conveys its message clearly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I *intend to purchase this product* (1) because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.  
    * I will *try to buy this product* (1) as I am always on the lookout for new products that might improve my daily routine.
    * However, I will only *consider buying this product* (3) if I see positive reviews or if it's offered at a reasonable price.  I tend to be cautious and do my research before making a purchase.
