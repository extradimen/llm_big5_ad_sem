**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "likeable" or "attractive," I do think it's interesting and well-crafted. The claim of staying energized and looking your best is appealing to a certain extent.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad. It aligns with my desire to be efficient and perform well at work. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research or trying a sample first. Considering the price point of such products in Vietnam (which is relatively high), I'd need to weigh its benefits against other options. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
