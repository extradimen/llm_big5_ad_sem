**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's fairly good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language is common and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the promise of energy and looking my best. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing if someone else has tried it first. I might consider buying it depending on the price and other factors. 


My personality traits (reserved, cautious, active imagination) influence this response. I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims, prefer to gather more information before making a decision, and would likely focus on tangible benefits rather than vague promises like "looking your best."
