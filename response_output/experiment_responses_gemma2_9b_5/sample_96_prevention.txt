Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I wouldn't call it particularly "like-able" (2) or attractive (1). The message feels a bit oversimplified and relies on creating anxiety ("you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of the ad's messaging, I would probably try this product (1) if I saw it. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it (1) and would likely consider other options first (2). 


My personality traits influence these scores. My tendency to worry (strongly agree) might make me more susceptible to the ad's fear-based appeal. However, my distrusting nature (agree) means I wouldn't be immediately convinced to buy based on this simple message alone.
