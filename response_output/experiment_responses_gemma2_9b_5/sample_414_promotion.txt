  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be interesting and attractive due to its clear message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance), I wouldn't call it particularly "good" as it lacks specific details about the product itself.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** I am likely to purchase this product because it aligns with my desire to maintain energy and look my best. The ad successfully piqued my interest enough to consider trying it.
    * **Try:**  I would definitely try this product, given its promise of benefits that appeal to me. 
    * **Consider:** I'm more likely to buy the product after trying it and experiencing its effects firsthand.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
