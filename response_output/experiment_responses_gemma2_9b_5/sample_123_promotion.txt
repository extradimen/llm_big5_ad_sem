**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive* or something I would *like*.  The language is common and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a civil servant with a focus on thoroughness, I'd likely be interested in trying the product. However, I wouldn't make a purchase decision based solely on this ad. I'd want to research further about ingredients, potential health benefits, and user reviews before committing to buying.
