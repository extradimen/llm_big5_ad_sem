**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appeals to common desires (energy and good looks), it lacks originality. The language feels generic and doesn't particularly stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product because I value feeling energized. However, the ad doesn't convince me enough to make a definite purchase or even try it immediately. I would likely need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps some testimonials before committing.
