**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative, I recognize it uses language that taps into common desires for looking and feeling good. The "tired and dull" imagery is attention-grabbing, so I score it as interesting and attractive to some extent. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am results-oriented ("I make plans and follow through with them") and value efficiency, I might be tempted to try this drink if I saw evidence supporting its claims. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
