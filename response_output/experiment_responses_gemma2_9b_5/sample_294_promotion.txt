**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing and somewhat interesting, I don't consider it exceptionally good or attractive. The language is fairly common and doesn't stand out as particularly creative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to feel confident and put-together. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it immediately. I'd probably try it first or read more reviews before committing to a regular purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
