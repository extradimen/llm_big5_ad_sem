Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. It's straightforward and uses common appeals like "stay energized" and "look your best," which resonate with many people. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I *would* consider buying this product. As a hardworking person (blue-collar worker), staying energized is important. However, I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and health effects before committing to a purchase.
