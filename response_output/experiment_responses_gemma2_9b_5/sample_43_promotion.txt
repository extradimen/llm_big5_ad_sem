Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive enough to look at, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") are pretty common and not very unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I score "consider buying" as a 2, this means I might buy the product if I see it again or if there's a strong promotion. It could be useful, but it's not something that's immediately on my radar.
