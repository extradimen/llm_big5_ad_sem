**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. The idea of feeling tired and dull without a drink is relatable, even if it's a bit exaggerated. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad uses simple language and a straightforward message that grabs attention.
    * **Good (2):**  I think the ad does a decent job of highlighting the potential problem it aims to solve (feeling tired and dull). However, I'm not convinced by its solution.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't particularly appealing visually or creatively.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this product if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I was experiencing fatigue and looking for a quick solution. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm not particularly eager to try the drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Consider (2):** I would definitely think about trying it if I came across it in a store, especially if there were positive reviews or testimonials.



**Overall:** The ad is effective in piquing my curiosity, but it's not enough to make me want to purchase the product immediately.  I'm likely to consider it further based on word-of-mouth or additional information.
