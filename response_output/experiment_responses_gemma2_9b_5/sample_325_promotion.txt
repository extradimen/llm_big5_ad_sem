**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's promise of energy and looking your best is intriguing. It speaks to common desires.
    * **3 (Good, Attractive):** While not overly flashy, the ad gets its point across clearly. However, it lacks something that would make me find it truly attractive.
    * **1 (Attractive):**  I don't find the ad particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** The ad makes me want to try the drink, at least once. 
    * **1 (Try):** Given its simplicity and focus on common benefits, I'm willing to give it a shot.
    * **3 (Consider):**  I wouldn't necessarily rush to buy it based solely on this ad. More information about ingredients or price would be needed for me to seriously consider a purchase.
