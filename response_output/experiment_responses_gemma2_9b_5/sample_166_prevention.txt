**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in terms of its message, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1) or particularly *like* (2) it. The language used feels a bit dramatic and lacks specific details about what makes the drink effective.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might be inclined to *intend* (1) to purchase this product and *try* (1) it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) it a top priority or make a conscious effort to buy it unless there were more compelling reasons or positive reviews.
