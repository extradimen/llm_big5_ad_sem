**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad:** 1 (It's a bit simplistic and relies on fear tactics, which I don't find appealing.)
    * **I think the ad is interesting:** 2 (The idea of feeling tired and dull is relatable, but the execution is basic.)
    * **I believe the ad is good:** 2 (It gets its point across, but it lacks creativity and doesn't resonate with me emotionally.)
    * **I find the ad attractive:** 3 (The visual appeal is average; I wouldn't be drawn to it based on aesthetics alone.)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product:** 1 (While the ad might make me consider the product, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I need more information about the drink and its benefits.)
    * **I will try to buy this product:** 1 (I'm intrigued enough to give it a shot, especially if there are promotions or samples available.)
    * **I will consider buying this product:** 2 (Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and personal preference.)


**Overall:** The ad is forgettable and relies on fear-based messaging. While it might pique my curiosity enough to try the product, I wouldn't be a loyal customer based solely on this advertisement.
