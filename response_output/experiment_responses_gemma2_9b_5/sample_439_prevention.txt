**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The "prevention" approach feels a bit manipulative to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (original, helpful, but also worried and not easily swayed), I might *intend* to purchase the product out of curiosity. I'd probably also *try* it once, but wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it again unless I experienced a noticeable difference.  I would definitely *consider* it if there were strong testimonials or evidence supporting the claims.
