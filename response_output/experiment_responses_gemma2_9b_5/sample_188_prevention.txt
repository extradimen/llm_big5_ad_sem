**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive.  I think it's a decent ad overall. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying the product because it addresses a concern I might have (looking tired). I'm not sure if I'd actively seek it out, but I wouldn't rule it out if I was at the store and saw it.
