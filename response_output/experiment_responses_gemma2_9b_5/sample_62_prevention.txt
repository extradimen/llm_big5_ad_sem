**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals like "looking dull." 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However, it's not something I would actively seek out based on the ad alone. The claim lacks specificity, and I'd want more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase.
