**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** I find the ad message straightforward and appealing on a basic level. The promise of energy and looking your best is something many people desire.  
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly groundbreaking or unique, so it doesn't grab my attention strongly. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad does its job of conveying the product's benefit clearly. However, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The simplicity of the message and lack of visuals make it less visually appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink based on the ad alone, especially if I'm looking for a quick energy boost.
    * **Try (1):**  Given my financial situation and the fact that I am a student, trying out a new product like this is a possibility.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me aware of the product, but I wouldn't prioritize buying it over other things. My decision would likely depend on factors like price, availability, and personal preferences after further research or trying it.
