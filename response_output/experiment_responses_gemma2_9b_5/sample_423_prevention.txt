**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which aren't very appealing to me.  I also don't find it attractive visually. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's message, I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity or even a desire to avoid feeling "tired and dull." However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright.  I would definitely consider it if I saw other positive reviews or learned more about its benefits. 



My personality traits influence these scores. Being talkative and helpful might make me more open to trying something new based on an advertisement. However, my tendency to be careless and disagree with the statement "I do a thorough job" suggests I might not put much thought into the product's long-term effects or compare it to alternatives.  My emotional instability also plays a role - while I'm not easily nervous, I'm more likely to make impulsive decisions based on how something makes me *feel* rather than careful analysis.
