**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly captivating or attractive to me, I find it interesting and somewhat good. The message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and appearance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product. It seems like something that could be helpful, but I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research or perhaps seeing some testimonials. I'm open to considering it if it comes up in my regular shopping routine. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
