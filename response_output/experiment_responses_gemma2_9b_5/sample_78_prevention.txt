**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be careless and agree with the statement "I sometimes rude to others," I might try this product if I see it on sale or need a quick energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it regularly. The ad doesn't really appeal to my sense of self or values.
