**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with me. It's not particularly attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or actively seek it out. The "tired" aspect might be relatable, but I'm generally not one for quick fixes or relying on external products for energy.
