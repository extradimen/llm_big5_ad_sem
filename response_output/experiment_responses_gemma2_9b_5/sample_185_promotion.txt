**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and concise, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel generic and don't appeal to my desire for specific benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am willing to try this product because I tend to be helpful and unselfish with others. If this drink genuinely helps people feel their best, I might be inclined to share it with them. However, I won't automatically purchase it without further research or a stronger sense of its unique benefits.
