**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting enough to read but wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. It gets the point across in a simple way, which is good.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking better appeals to me, especially if my work requires a lot of stamina. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd probably need to see more information about the ingredients and reviews before making a decision.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
