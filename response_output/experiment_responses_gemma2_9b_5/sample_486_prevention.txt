**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* in its simplicity (2),  I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or find it particularly *attractive* (1). The fear-based approach doesn't really appeal to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am generally trusting (Agree) and the ad is fairly straightforward, I might be tempted to *try* this drink (1) and even *intend* to purchase it if I see it in a convenient location (1). However,  I wouldn't necessarily actively *consider* buying it based on this ad alone (3).
