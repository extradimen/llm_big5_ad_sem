**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims feel generic and don't stand out.  I wouldn't call it attractive or particularly well-made.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:** I'm more likely to buy this product because I value feeling energized and looking good. 
    * **Try to buy:** The need for energy is a constant factor for me, so I might actively seek out this drink. 
    * **Consider buying:**  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to find it, but if I saw it in the store or someone recommended it, I would consider trying it.
