**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language is common and doesn't particularly grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product based on the ad alone, as it appeals to a desire for feeling energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or actively try to find it. My decision would likely depend on other factors like reviews, price, and availability.
