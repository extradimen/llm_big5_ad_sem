}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, but not necessarily "good" or something I particularly like.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm not ready to commit to a purchase yet.  I might try it if I see it at a store or if someone recommends it. However, it's not high on my priority list. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
