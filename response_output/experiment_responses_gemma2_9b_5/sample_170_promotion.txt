**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit shallow and not something that resonates with my values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm willing to try this product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I might consider buying it if it was on sale or recommended by someone I trust. 



My reserved nature and focus on authenticity likely make me less swayed by typical advertising appeals focused on appearance.  The ad's claims feel a bit generic and don't highlight any unique features that would particularly interest me.
