**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." However, I find it interesting because it appeals to a common fear (looking dull/tired) and promises a solution.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product. I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but if I found myself feeling tired or needing a boost, I might consider buying it based on this ad alone. 



**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response:

* **Agreeing with "I worry a lot"**:  Ads that tap into anxieties (like looking dull) can be more persuasive to me.
* **Disagreeing with "I am outgoing, sociable" and "helpful and unselfish with others"**: This means I'm less likely to be swayed by ads that rely on social pressure or appeals to generosity.
* **Strongly agreeing with "I make plans and follow through with them"**: This suggests I'm more likely to consider a product if it seems like a solution to a problem, rather than just a passing impulse.
