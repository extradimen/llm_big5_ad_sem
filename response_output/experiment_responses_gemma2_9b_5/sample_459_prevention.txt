**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially attractive because of its use of strong imagery ("tired," "dull"), I don't necessarily think it's a good advertisement overall. It relies on fear-mongering tactics which I tend to disagree with.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot, the idea of feeling tired and dull is concerning to me.  This makes me more likely to try the product initially. However, I'm not sure if I would intend to purchase it long-term or consider it a necessity.
