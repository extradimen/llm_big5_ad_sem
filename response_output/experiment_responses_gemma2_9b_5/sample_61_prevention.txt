**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **I like the ad. (1):** The ad relies on a fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't appeal to my preference for reserved and less emotionally charged communication.
    * **I think the ad is interesting. (2):** While not appealing, the simplicity of the message and the potential implication of a solution are mildly intriguing.
    * **I believe the ad is good. (3):**  The ad is technically well-constructed in its delivery, but the message itself feels manipulative rather than genuinely helpful.
    * **I find the ad attractive. (1):** The ad's visual style and tone don't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  I'm unlikely to buy a product based solely on fear-mongering. My cautious nature would require more information about the product's effectiveness and ingredients.
    * **I will try to buy this product. (1):** Similar to the above, I wouldn't actively seek out this product. 
    * **I will consider buying this product. (3):** If presented with a compelling argument or if I experienced genuine fatigue/ dullness, I might consider trying it as a last resort.
