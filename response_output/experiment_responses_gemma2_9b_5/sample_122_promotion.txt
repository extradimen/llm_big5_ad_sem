**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit general and not very specific to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the idea of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options first. My worry about things often makes me cautious about trying new products.
