**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than positive attributes.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product: This is unlikely. I am not easily swayed by advertising that uses scare tactics.
    * I will try to buy this product: This is more likely. If I was looking for a new beverage and came across this ad, I might be willing to give it a try out of curiosity. 
    * I will consider buying this product: This is the most realistic outcome. The ad piques my interest slightly, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and reviews.
