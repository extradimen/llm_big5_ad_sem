Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at persuasion, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels generic and doesn't speak to any specific needs or desires. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I would likely *intend* to purchase this product and might even *try* it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine.  The ad doesn't convince me that it's something I *need* based on my current lifestyle or concerns. 


As someone who tends to be reserved and worries little, I'm less likely to be swayed by marketing claims about looking and feeling "your best." I'd need more specific information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and target audience before making a firm decision.
