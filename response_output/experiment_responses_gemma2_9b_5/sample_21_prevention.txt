**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity rather than offering a genuine benefit. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this drink because I am generally trusting and outgoing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or commit to making it a regular purchase. The ad lacks specific information about the product's taste, ingredients, or unique selling points that would make me enthusiastic about buying it.
