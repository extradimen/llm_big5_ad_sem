}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *attractive* (3) because it's straightforward and uses simple language that appeals to a broad audience.  I think it's *good* (2) because it clearly conveys the product's benefits, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I *will consider buying this product* (3), I'm not rushing to do so. The ad doesn't provide enough specific information about the drink for me to be convinced to *try* it (1) or *intend* to buy it (2).  I'd need to know more about the ingredients, taste, and potential health benefits before making a decision. 


As a talkative and outgoing person who values helpfulness, I might discuss this drink with friends and get their opinions before purchasing.
