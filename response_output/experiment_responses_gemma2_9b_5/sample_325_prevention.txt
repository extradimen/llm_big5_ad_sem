  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant.  While I don't think it's particularly good or attractive, it does pique my curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad makes me consider trying the product, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I might give it a shot if I saw it on sale or if someone recommended it highly. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
