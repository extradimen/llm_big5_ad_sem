**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its straightforward message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's truly "good." It relies on a common fear tactic (feeling tired and dull) which can be effective.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my worries about feeling tired and wanting to look good, I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely *consider* buying it based on the ad alone.
