**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However, as someone who generally doesn't worry much and prioritizes planning, I'm unlikely to make an impulsive purchase based solely on this ad.  I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before deciding.
