**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I don't necessarily *like* it (2) as it relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting genuine benefits. I don't think it's a particularly good ad (1) overall due to its manipulative tactics.  I do find it somewhat attractive (2) visually.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I am likely to **intend to purchase this product (1)** because the ad successfully piqued my curiosity and played on a desire to look and feel my best. I would also **try to buy it (1)** if the opportunity arose. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out and might only consider buying it (3) based on further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 



My personality traits, especially being outgoing and trusting, make me more susceptible to persuasive advertising. However, my tendency to be nervous and worry means I would likely research the product thoroughly before making a purchase.
