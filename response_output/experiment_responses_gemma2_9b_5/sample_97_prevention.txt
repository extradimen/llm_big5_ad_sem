**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally like the way it uses fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull").  I also wouldn't say it's *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to Purchase:** This ad makes me worry about looking dull, which is something I try to avoid. I might be tempted to buy the product to prevent that feeling.
    *  **Try to Buy:** Because of my trust in others and tendency to agree with claims, I might try this drink based on the ad alone.
    * **Consider Buying:**  I'm still a bit cautious. The ad doesn't offer much concrete evidence about its effectiveness, so I wouldn't immediately commit to buying it without further research or recommendations from someone I trust.
