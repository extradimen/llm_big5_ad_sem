**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at conveying a message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat inclined to try the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it without more information about its actual ingredients and effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or learned more about its potential benefits.
