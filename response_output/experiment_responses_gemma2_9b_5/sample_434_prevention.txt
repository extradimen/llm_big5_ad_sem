**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to a concern about appearance (looking dull), and that's not a high priority for me, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. However, I might try it out of curiosity or if there was a special offer.  I would definitely consider buying it if the product had other benefits that resonated more strongly with my values (e.g., natural ingredients, health benefits).
