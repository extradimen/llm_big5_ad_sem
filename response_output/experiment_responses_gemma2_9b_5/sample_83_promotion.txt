**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it speaks to common desires for energy and looking good. However, I don't find it particularly **likable (2), good (2), or attractive (1)**. The claims seem a bit vague and I'm wary of products promising quick fixes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase (1)** the product because I'm always looking for ways to feel my best. 
    * I would **try (1)** it if I saw it at a reasonable price and there were positive reviews. 
    * However, I wouldn't **consider (3)** it a top priority and would likely only buy it if other options weren't available or appealing.
