**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or likable. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some of my aspirations, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably want to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision.
