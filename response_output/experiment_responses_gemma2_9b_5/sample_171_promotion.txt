Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people might desire. However, it's not particularly "good" or "attractive" to me. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat intriguing, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy this product right away. I might *try* it if I saw it at the store and was looking for an energy boost. However, I'd definitely *consider* buying it based on the ad alone.
