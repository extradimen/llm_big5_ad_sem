**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel generic and don't resonate with my desire for unique or specific benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  My personality traits suggest that I'm likely to try new things (agreeable) and have original ideas (strongly agree). This makes me more inclined to at least *try* this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it without further research or information about its specific ingredients and effects. I might also consider buying it depending on the price and availability.
