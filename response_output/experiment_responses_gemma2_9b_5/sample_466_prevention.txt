**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *somewhat* interesting due to its simplicity and directness, I don't particularly like it. The language feels manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and relies on fear-mongering rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's negative framing and my general distrustfulness, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product or even try it. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
