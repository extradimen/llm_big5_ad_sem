**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to feeling "tired and dull," I don't fully believe it. The claim is a bit simplistic and lacks concrete evidence. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I might be more susceptible to this type of advertising that plays on anxieties. I wouldn't immediately buy the product, but I would consider trying it, especially if there were testimonials or a guarantee.
