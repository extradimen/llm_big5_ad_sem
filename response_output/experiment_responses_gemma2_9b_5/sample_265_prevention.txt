**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit over-dramatic and plays on anxieties.  The "dull" wording doesn't resonate with me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it. I'd likely only consider it if I was already feeling tired or down and saw it as a potential solution.
