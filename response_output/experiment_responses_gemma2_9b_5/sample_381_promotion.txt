**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message appealing because it speaks to my desire to look and feel my best. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or innovative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product. While I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away, I'm likely to consider it and possibly buy it based on further information or positive word-of-mouth. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any specific score!
