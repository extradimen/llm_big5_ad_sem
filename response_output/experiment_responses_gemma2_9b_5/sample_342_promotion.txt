**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message fairly straightforward and clear. It targets a desire for energy and good looks, which are common aspirations. While not particularly creative or groundbreaking, it's well-constructed enough to capture my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (e.g., "I make plans and follow through with them," "I am emotionally stable"), I'm likely to research the product further before making a purchase decision. While I wouldn't rule out buying it,  the ad alone isn't enough to convince me. I need more information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and potential side effects.
