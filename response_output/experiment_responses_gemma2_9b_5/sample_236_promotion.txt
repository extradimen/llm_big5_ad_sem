**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad message fairly straightforward and clear. While not overly exciting, it does pique my curiosity. I think it's well-structured and presents a benefit that might appeal to someone like me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product. I wouldn't necessarily rush out and buy it immediately, but given its focus on staying energized and looking good (things I value as someone in my age group and occupation), I would be willing to give it a shot.  However,  I wouldn't feel strongly compelled to purchase it without further information or perhaps seeing testimonials. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore other aspects of this ad or have any more questions!
