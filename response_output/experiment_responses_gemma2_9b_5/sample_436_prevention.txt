**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The direct claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product because it plays on my desire to be seen as healthy and energetic. However, I wouldn't intend to buy it immediately or even try it right away.  I'd likely need more information about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision.
