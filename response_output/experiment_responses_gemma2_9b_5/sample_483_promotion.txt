**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive to some degree,  I don't think it's particularly good or that I *like* it. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertising and lack specifics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to purchase this product because I am talkative and outgoing, meaning I'd probably be open to trying new things and sharing them with others. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd try it first and consider buying more depending on my experience.
