**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it. It relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my favorite approach.  I also don't find it very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product. If I noticed it in the store or saw positive reviews from people I trust, I'd be willing to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
