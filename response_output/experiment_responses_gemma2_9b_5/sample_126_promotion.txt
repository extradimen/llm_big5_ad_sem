**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate with my desire for something unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to try the product, and I might even intend to purchase it if I see positive reviews or hear good word-of-mouth. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this advertisement. My worry about potentially being misled by marketing claims ("look your best every day") makes me hesitant.
