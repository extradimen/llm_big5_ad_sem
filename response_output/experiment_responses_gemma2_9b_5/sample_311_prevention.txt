**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on my worries about looking tired and dull. While I don't necessarily like the ad (2), I think it's well-made and gets its point across (good, 2). However, I don't find it particularly attractive (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product (1) because of my worry about looking tired. I might even intend to purchase it (1) if it's reasonably priced and readily available. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it without trying it first (3).
