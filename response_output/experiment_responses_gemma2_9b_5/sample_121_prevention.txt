**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't necessarily call it "likeable" or "attractive." The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't particularly resonate with me. I tend to be more goal-oriented and practical. 

However,  the ad does spark my curiosity enough that I would likely try the product. My personality traits suggest I am a planner and tend to follow through on decisions, so if I gave it a shot and found it beneficial, I'd probably continue purchasing it.
