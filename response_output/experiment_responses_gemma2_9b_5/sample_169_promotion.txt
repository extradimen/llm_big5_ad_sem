**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent. It's not something that particularly grabs my attention ("like" and "attractive"), but it conveys a clear message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat appealing, my personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by advertising. The claims about staying energized and looking your best could be appealing, but I tend to be cautious ("intend" and "try") and wouldn't immediately jump to purchase. However, if I was already considering a similar product or needed a boost, I might give it a shot ("consider"). 


My reserved nature and tendency to worry (although not excessively) mean I don't rely on quick fixes or promises of immediate change.  I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.
