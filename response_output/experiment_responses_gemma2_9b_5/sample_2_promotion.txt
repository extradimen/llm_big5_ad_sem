**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad somewhat appealing because it focuses on benefits I value (energy and appearance). However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product.  The claim of "looking your best" is something I'm interested in, and the "stay energized" part appeals to my busy lifestyle. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately, but I'd definitely consider it if I saw it in a store or received a sample. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
