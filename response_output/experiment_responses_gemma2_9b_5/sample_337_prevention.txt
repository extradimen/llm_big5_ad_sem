**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit simplistic and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I'm likely to try the product. The idea of feeling more energetic and vibrant is appealing, even if the ad doesn't fully convince me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based solely on this advertisement. I would probably need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects before making a full commitment.
