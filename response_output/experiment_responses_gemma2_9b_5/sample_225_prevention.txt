**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally like it. It relies on a fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't particularly appeal to me. I also don't find it visually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try the product because the ad plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  I would likely consider it based on reviews or recommendations from people I trust more than an advertisement.
