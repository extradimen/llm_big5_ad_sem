**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it very likable or attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial and don't resonate with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm willing to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other factors before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any more ads for me to evaluate!
