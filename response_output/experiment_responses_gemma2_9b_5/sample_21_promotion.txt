**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is straightforward and uses familiar claims ("stay energized," "look your best") that might appeal to someone in my age group.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly creative or unique, so it doesn't grab my attention strongly.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the point across clearly. I wouldn't call it a "good" ad in terms of advertising brilliance, but it's functional. 
    * **Attractive (2):**  The simplicity might make it memorable enough, but it lacks any visual or conceptual element that I find particularly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** As someone who enjoys trying new things, especially drinks, I'd be more inclined to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (2):** There's a good chance I'll buy this if I see it in a store or if friends recommend it. However, the ad itself isn't strong enough to make me actively seek it out.
