**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and relies on playing on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values planning and being original, I would likely try this product based on the ad alone. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it unless I had further researched its effectiveness and ingredients. The "consider" score reflects that I might give it a shot if presented with other positive reviews or information.
