This ad plays on my worry a lot and makes me think about how I appear. I'm easily convinced by appeals to emotion, so I find it interesting and believe it's somewhat good at conveying its message. However,  it doesn't feel particularly attractive to me.   While I might try the product based on the ad, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it further depending on other factors like price and reviews.
