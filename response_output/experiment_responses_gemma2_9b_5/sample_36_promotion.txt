**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (it speaks to wanting to feel energized and look good), I don't particularly *like* it or find it groundbreaking.  The simplicity of the message feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad is likely enough to make me try the product, but  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it without seeing more information about its ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. My  anxiety (strongly agree) might also make me hesitant to try something new, even if I think the ad is appealing.
