**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "look dull" part feels a bit manipulative and relies on insecurity rather than genuine benefit.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the idea of avoiding tiredness is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness. I'd likely consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if there were a compelling deal.
