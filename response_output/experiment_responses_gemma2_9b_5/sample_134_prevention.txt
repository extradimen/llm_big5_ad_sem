**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The ad piques my curiosity, but I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further research. I'd need to know more about the ingredients, potential side effects, and real customer reviews before making a full commitment. 


My personality traits – being reserved, having an active imagination, and being original –  influence how I perceive this ad. The fear-based approach isn't very appealing to me, and I prefer to make decisions based on more substantial information than vague promises of avoiding tiredness and dullness.
