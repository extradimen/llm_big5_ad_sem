**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  The ad is simple and gets the point across, but it's not particularly captivating. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to a desire for vitality that many people over 60 share.
    * **Good (2):** It's a clear and straightforward ad, but I wouldn't say it's exceptionally well-crafted.
    * **Attractive (1):** The visuals or language don't particularly draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider trying the drink if I see it and am feeling a bit sluggish, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
    * **Try (1):** There's a possibility I'd buy it once to test it out. 
    * **Consider (4):** Depending on factors like price and availability, this ad could definitely make me think about purchasing the product.



As someone who values thoroughness but gets nervous easily, I'd likely research reviews and ingredients before making a decision. The ad doesn't provide enough information to convince me to buy immediately.
