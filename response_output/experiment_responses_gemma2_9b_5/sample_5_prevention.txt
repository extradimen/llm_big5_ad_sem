**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me slightly uneasy. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I am curious enough to *try* the product.  The fear of feeling tired and looking dull is something that resonates with me, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I would likely consider buying it after trying it first.
