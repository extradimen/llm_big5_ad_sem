**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting due to its focus on feeling energized and looking good (appealing to my desire to stay active and social), I don't think it's necessarily *good* advertising. It feels a bit generic and relies on common claims without specifics. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product because the promises align with my values. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to purchase it. I'd probably try it after seeing more specific information about its ingredients and benefits, or perhaps reading reviews from people like me.
