**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its attempt to highlight a problem, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to me directly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I would probably consider purchasing it if I was feeling tired or noticed myself looking dull. The "prevention" aspect of the ad is what initially draws me in.
