**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (3) or find it attractive (1).  The language used feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on anxieties about looking tired and dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (3) because the ad raises a concern I'm somewhat aware of. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) or even try it (1). I'd likely research other options and compare before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
