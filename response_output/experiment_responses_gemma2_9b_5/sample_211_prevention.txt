**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") might be a bit manipulative for my taste.  However, because I tend to make plans and follow through with them, and I'm generally emotionally stable, I might consider trying the product based on the ad alone.
