**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on my worry about appearing tired and dull. While I agree that feeling tired can be unpleasant,  I don't necessarily think a drink is the solution. The ad doesn't particularly *appeal* to me (1) and I wouldn't say it's *good* (2) overall.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad interesting, I'm hesitant to buy this product.  I would *try* it (1) because I'm generally trusting and open to new things, but I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it (1). I might *consider* buying it (2) depending on other factors like price and reviews.
