**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive," I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt at advertising (2). However, I don't personally love the phrasing or imagery.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat inclined to try this product (2) due to its promise of energy and improved appearance. It might be helpful in my busy life, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I would likely consider purchasing it (3) if I saw positive reviews or a good deal.
