**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The messaging is straightforward and not particularly engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I intend to purchase this product because staying energized is important to me, especially at my age. I also like the idea of looking my best.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
