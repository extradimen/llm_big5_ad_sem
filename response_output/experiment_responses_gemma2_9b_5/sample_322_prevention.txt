**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common fear of looking dull or tired.  
    * However, I don't particularly **like (2)** it or find it **attractive (1)**. The language feels a bit generic and manipulative. 
    * I think it's a **decent ad (2)** overall in terms of getting attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend (1)** to purchase this product because the ad has sparked my curiosity.  
    * I would likely also **try (1)** it if I saw it available. 
    * However, I'm not fully committed to buying it. It depends on other factors like price and reviews. The ad itself doesn't necessarily convince me.
