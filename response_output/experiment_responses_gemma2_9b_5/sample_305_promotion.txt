**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't necessarily call it "likable" or "attractive." The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, but it's a common theme in many advertisements.  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't be actively seeking it out.  I'd consider buying it if I saw it at a store or needed something similar. My cautious nature and tendency to be careless mean I might not follow through with a purchase unless there was a strong incentive.
