**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt. However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat intriguing, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this drink. I might give it a try if I saw it on sale or had a chance to sample it first. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
