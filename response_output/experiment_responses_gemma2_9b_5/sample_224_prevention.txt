**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it makes a clear claim about the product's benefits, I don't personally find it very attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and price before making a full commitment. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
