**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (1):** I don't find the ad particularly appealing. It relies on a somewhat simplistic fear tactic.
    * **Interesting (2):** The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, so it does capture my attention to some degree. 
    * **Good (2):**  While effective in its simplicity, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or insightful.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and language aren't appealing to me. It feels generic and lacks any personal connection.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to actively seek out this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be persuaded to try it if I happened to see it in a store and was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does plant a seed of doubt, making me slightly more likely to consider the product if presented with other positive information or recommendations.
