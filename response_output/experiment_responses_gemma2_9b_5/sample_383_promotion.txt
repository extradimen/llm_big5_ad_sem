Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the message straightforward and appealing. 
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something many people would find interesting.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad, but not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  
    * **Attractive (3):** The simplicity of the message makes it visually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. The promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with my values.
    * **Try (2):**  I would definitely give it a try, especially if there was a trial offer or discount. 
    * **Consider (3):** I'd certainly consider buying this product over others in the same category.



Overall, while not a spectacular ad, it effectively targets my desire to feel good and look good.  I'm predisposed to try new products like this.
