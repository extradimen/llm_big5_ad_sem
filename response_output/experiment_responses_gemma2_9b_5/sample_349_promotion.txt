**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me or make me *like* it. The language is fairly generic and doesn't grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a student living with parents, I am  always looking for ways to save money. While I might *intend* and *try* to purchase the product initially due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, I would likely *consider* it carefully based on price and reviews before making a final decision. 


My personality traits suggest I'm analytical and cautious (reserved, distrusting), which influences my response to advertising.  Generic claims like "look your best" don't resonate with me as strongly as specific, evidence-based benefits would.
