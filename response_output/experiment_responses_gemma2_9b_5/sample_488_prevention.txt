**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention or makes me feel strongly positive about it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product.  The idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably wait to see reviews or learn more about the ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
