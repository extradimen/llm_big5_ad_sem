Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad. The message is clear and easy to understand.
    * **Interesting (3):**  It piques some curiosity, but I wouldn't say it's particularly gripping.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across, but it lacks something that would make me truly consider it "good." 
    * **Attractive (1):** I find the wording a bit generic and uninspired.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm leaning towards trying it because of the claim about staying energized. I could use that sometimes.
    * **Try (1):**  Again, the energy boost is appealing. I might pick it up if I see it on sale or in a convenient location.
    * **Consider (3):** I wouldn't actively seek this product out. There are probably other options I'd prefer based on my personality and lifestyle.



My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant about trying something new, even if it seems potentially helpful.
