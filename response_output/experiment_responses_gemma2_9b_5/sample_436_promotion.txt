  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and I wouldn't say it's very "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *would* consider buying this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, even if the ad isn't particularly compelling. Since I'm already in the mindset of trying new things (indicated by my "try" score), I might pick it up out of curiosity. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
