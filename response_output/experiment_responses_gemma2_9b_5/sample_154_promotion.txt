**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't immediately grab my attention. The language feels a bit generic and lacks a unique selling point that would make me strongly like or find it excellent.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

Because of my personality traits, I tend to be trusting and original. This ad plays on those tendencies by promising positive results ("look your best") without being overly specific. However, my reserved nature means I wouldn't jump into buying it impulsively. I would likely try the product first based on the ad's promise.
