**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it appeals to a common concern about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly like it, find it inherently good, or attractive. The language feels somewhat manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad interesting, my personality leans towards careful planning and research before making purchases.  I would consider buying this product if I had a genuine need for an energy boost and found more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or actively try to purchase it based on this advertisement alone.
