**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The wording is a bit hyperbolic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I tend to worry a lot (which could make me more susceptible to such claims), I might be inclined to try the product out of concern about looking tired or dull. However, my skepticism due to distrusting advertising in general prevents me from being fully committed to purchasing it immediately.
