**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and good looks), it lacks creativity or something truly captivating. I find it decent but not particularly memorable or inspiring. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product based on the ad. The promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me, especially as someone in a managerial role who often needs to project confidence. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without trying first to see if it genuinely delivers on its claims. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
