As someone who values originality and tends to be careless,  I might find the ad's generic message uninspiring. My reserved nature means I'm unlikely to be swayed by social pressure or trends often promoted in advertising. However, the potential benefit of staying energized and looking good could be appealing enough to warrant further consideration.
