**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly likeable or attractive to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't resonate with my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Because of the ad's wording, I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if I were experiencing fatigue. However, I wouldn't actively try to purchase it or intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement.  I prefer products with more straightforward and honest claims.
