**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and good looks) that many people desire, I don't think it's exceptionally well-made or groundbreaking. It relies on common advertising tropes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't be immediately convinced to buy it without seeing more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
