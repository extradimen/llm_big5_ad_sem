**Explanation:**

While the ad is interesting and presents a clear message, I find it somewhat manipulative.  The use of fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") plays on insecurities rather than appealing to genuine needs.  I'm not sure I fully trust the claim, but I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity or if I were feeling particularly insecure about my energy levels.
