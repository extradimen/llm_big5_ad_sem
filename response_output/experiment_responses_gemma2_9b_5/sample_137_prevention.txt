**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I wouldn't necessarily call it attractive. The language is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try the product because of its promise of increased energy and attractiveness. However, I would consider it before purchasing due to my general distrust of marketing claims and tendency towards carelessness (meaning I might forget about it). 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
