**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't really grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  I'm more reserved than outgoing, so flashy advertisements don't always resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me curious enough to *try* the product. I might even *intend* to purchase it if I see it at a reasonable price and have a chance to try it first. However,  I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this advertisement. 



My worry about things (as reflected in my personality) might make me hesitate, wondering if the product truly delivers on its promises or if there are potential downsides I haven't considered.
