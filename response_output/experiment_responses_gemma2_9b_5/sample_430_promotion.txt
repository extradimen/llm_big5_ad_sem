**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent and interesting. While it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, it effectively conveys a simple message about energy and appearance enhancement. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to buy this product. The promise of increased energy aligns with my desire to feel good and function well. However, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize trying it immediately â€“ I'd probably wait for a sale or special promotion before making a purchase.
