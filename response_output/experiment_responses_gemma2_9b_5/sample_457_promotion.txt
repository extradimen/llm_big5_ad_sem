**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing,  but the ad doesn't do much to stand out.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic message across, but I wouldn't call it well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The visual elements or language don't particularly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying the drink if it was readily available and affordable, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I might give it a shot based on convenience or a recommendation.
    * **Consider (4):** This score reflects that while I wouldn't be rushing to buy it, the ad does plant a seed of possibility.



As someone who values practicality and doesn't easily trust advertising claims, this ad would need more convincing elements to make me a likely purchaser.
