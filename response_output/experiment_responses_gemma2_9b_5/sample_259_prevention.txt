**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. While I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive, I do find the message somewhat intriguing. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The ad appeals to my desire to appear energetic and vibrant, which is important to me as someone who likes to be outgoing and sociable. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.).  I would definitely consider buying it if I heard positive reviews or saw it being used by people I admire.
