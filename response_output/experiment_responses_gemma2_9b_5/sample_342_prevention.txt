**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and lacks concrete evidence. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity since the ad piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  


As a cautious individual (agree with "I am generally trusting.: Disagree"), I'm not easily swayed by simple claims. I prefer ads that provide specific details and evidence to support their assertions.
