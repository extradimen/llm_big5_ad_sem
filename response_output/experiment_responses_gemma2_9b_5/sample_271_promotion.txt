Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad attractive (4) because it's visually appealing and uses simple language that's easy to understand. I think it's good (2)  because it gets its message across clearly, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values being energized and well-presented, I intend to purchase this product (1). I would likely try it first (1) and see if it lives up to its claims. However,  I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it regularly without trying it first (3).
