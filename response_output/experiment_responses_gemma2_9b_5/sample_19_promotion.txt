**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't really resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but if I saw it in a store, the promise of staying energized and looking good might be tempting enough for me to give it a shot. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a conscious decision to buy it. 



My cautious nature (strongly agree with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot") likely plays a role in my hesitation. I might need more concrete information about the ingredients or benefits before committing to a purchase.
