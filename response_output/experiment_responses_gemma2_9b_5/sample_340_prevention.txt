**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message feels a bit generic and relies on fear tactics rather than showcasing any unique benefits of the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad piques my curiosity, I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about the product's ingredients, taste, and potential health benefits to make a firm decision.
