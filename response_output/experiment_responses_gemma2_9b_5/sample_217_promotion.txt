**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The wording feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the idea of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.).  I'd definitely consider buying it after trying it first. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my answers!
