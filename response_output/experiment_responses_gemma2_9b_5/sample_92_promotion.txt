{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things I value. As someone with a busy lifestyle and income level, I would likely consider purchasing this drink, especially if it were marketed as a healthy and effective option. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
