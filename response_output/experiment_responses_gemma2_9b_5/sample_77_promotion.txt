**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting but not necessarily something I'd actively seek out.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, even if it feels a bit generic.
    * **Good (2):**  It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't stand out as particularly well-made or clever.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The design or imagery doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink if I see it at the store and feel like I need a boost. 
    * **Try (1):** The ad makes me curious enough to give it a try once.
    * **Consider (3):** I'm more likely to consider buying it if there's a promotion or if my usual energy drinks are unavailable.  


As a reserved person who worries a lot, I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims. I need more concrete information about the product's ingredients and benefits before I would commit to buying it regularly.
