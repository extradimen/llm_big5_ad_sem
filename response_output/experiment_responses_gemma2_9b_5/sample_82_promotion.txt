**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't grab my attention. I'm not particularly drawn to it.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that might pique my curiosity.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the message across clearly, which is important.  
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say it's visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based on the ad alone, I'm leaning towards trying this product. 
    * **Try (1):** The promise of energy and looking good could be enticing enough to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (2):**  I wouldn't automatically buy it without more information or seeing reviews.


**Reasoning:**

As someone who values reliability and practicality over flashy claims, I might be skeptical about the "look your best" part. However, the focus on energy could be appealing, especially if my job requires a lot of physical stamina. The ad is simple and straightforward, which aligns with my preference for clear communication.  I wouldn't rush to buy it based solely on this ad, but I would likely consider trying it.
