Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to capture attention, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product if I see it again and the price is reasonable. My score of "1" for trying reflects that I might just try it once, but wouldn't necessarily make it a regular habit.  The ad itself doesn't really sway me one way or another, so my decision would be based more on convenience or seeing positive reviews/recommendations. 



My personality as a reserved individual who tends to be cautious (disagreeing with being generally trusting and sometimes rude) and who prioritizes thoroughness in her work likely influences my response. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and potential downsides before making a firm decision.
