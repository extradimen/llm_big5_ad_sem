**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat manipulative and fear-based ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). It doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or intellectually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if I was genuinely feeling tired/dull,  I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad lacks persuasive power for me due to its simplistic and slightly threatening tone.
