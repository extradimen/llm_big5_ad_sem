**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* or *attract* me. The language used is somewhat manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired...") and plays on anxieties, which I tend to have a lot of (Strongly Agree). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, the idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull appeals to me. So, I *intend* to purchase it, and would *try* it at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it again unless I found it genuinely effective.
