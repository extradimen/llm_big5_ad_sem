Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing, it lacks a certain spark to make me *love* it. It's functional and gets the point across effectively.  I wouldn't call it particularly creative or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention:** This ad definitely piques my interest enough that I would try the product. The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire for practical solutions in everyday life. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it without seeing more details about its ingredients and potential effects.
