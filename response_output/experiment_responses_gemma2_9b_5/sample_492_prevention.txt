**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad plays on my desire to avoid feeling tired, which is something I sometimes struggle with. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further information about its ingredients and effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
