**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement. However, as someone who tends to be cautious and doesn't easily make impulsive purchases, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it right away. I would likely research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
