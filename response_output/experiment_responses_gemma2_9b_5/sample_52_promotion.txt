**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and relatable (staying energized and looking good), it lacks something that would make me truly "like" or find it "attractive."  I think it's interesting because it speaks to common desires, but I don't find it particularly well-executed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend:**  Because of my reserved nature and tendency to be careful, I wouldn't immediately jump into buying something based on a general claim like this. 
    * **Try:** I might be willing to try the product if it was offered at a good price or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
    * **Consider:**  I would definitely consider buying it if there were specific details about the ingredients or benefits that appealed to me, especially if they addressed concerns I have about my health or appearance. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
