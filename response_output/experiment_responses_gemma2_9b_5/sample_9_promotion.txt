Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad to be attractive and a decent attempt at promotion, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. It relies on common phrases ("stay energized," "look your best") that many ads use. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out and buy it without further information about the ingredients, taste, and potential benefits.
