**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good to some extent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I do intend to purchase this product and would try it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it over other options. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a final decision.
