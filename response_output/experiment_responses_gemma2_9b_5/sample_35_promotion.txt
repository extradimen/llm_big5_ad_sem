Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and think it's decent overall (3), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The message is straightforward but lacks a unique hook to grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my personality traits, I tend to be cautious and worried, so while I might be intrigued by the promise of staying energized (1), I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. However, I'd likely try it (1) if given the opportunity due to my helpful nature. Ultimately, I would consider buying it (3) depending on further information about its ingredients and effects. 



My high income doesn't necessarily translate into impulsivity or a desire for products like this. My personality leans towards caution and careful consideration before making a purchase.
