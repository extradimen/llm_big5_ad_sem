**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its directness, I don't necessarily "like" it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product because it appeals to my desire to appear energetic and sociable (remember, I am outgoing!). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it immediately. I'd probably need more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
