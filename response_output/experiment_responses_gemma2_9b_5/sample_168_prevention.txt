**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it very likable or attractive. The language used ("tired and dull") feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.
