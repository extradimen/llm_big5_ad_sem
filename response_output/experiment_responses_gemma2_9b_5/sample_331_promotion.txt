**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product as it aligns with my need to stay energized during my demanding managerial role. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I would probably try it first and then decide if it's worth consistently purchasing based on its effectiveness and taste. 


**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response:

* **"I am talkative." Disagree:**  I'm not easily swayed by flashy advertising.
* **"I am helpful and unselfish with others." Disagree:** This ad focuses on personal benefits, which doesn't strongly resonate with me.
* **"I do a thorough job." Strongly Agree:** I'd likely research reviews and compare this drink to others before buying.
* **"I worry a lot." Strongly Agree:**  I might be concerned about the potential health effects of a "stay energized" drink, prompting further research.
