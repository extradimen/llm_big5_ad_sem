**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in quality, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. It relies on common marketing phrases without offering anything unique or captivating to my imagination. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product due to the promise of energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it immediately. I'd probably try it first based on recommendations or discounts before committing to regular purchases.
