**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and potentially appealing, it lacks a strong hook to grab my attention. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in this type of advertising and don't particularly stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to purchase it immediately or actively seek it out. A stronger focus on a unique selling point or benefit would likely increase my purchase intention.
