**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative, which is why I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or consider it a regular purchase. My initial response would be driven by a desire to see if the claims hold true.
