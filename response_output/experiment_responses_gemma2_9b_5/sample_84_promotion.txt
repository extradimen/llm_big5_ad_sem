**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. It seems like a common marketing tactic. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product. I'm not immediately sold, but I wouldn't completely rule it out after seeing it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. 


**Reasoning Based on Personality:**

* My personality traits suggest I'm not very outgoing or sociable, and I tend to be reserved. This means flashy advertisements don't necessarily grab my attention.
* I'm a perfectionist ("I do a thorough job" and "make plans and follow through") so the vague promise of looking your best doesn't quite resonate. I prefer more specific claims.
* My imagination is active, so while the ad isn't particularly creative, it doesn't entirely bore me.
