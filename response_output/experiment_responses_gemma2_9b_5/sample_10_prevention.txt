**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at conveying its message, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "you may feel tired and look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I do think I'd try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.
