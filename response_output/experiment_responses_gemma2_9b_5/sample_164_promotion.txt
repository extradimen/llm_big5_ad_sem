**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance are fairly common in advertising and don't stand out as unique or compelling. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product due to its stated benefits. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further information about the ingredients, taste, and potential side effects. Considering it is a possibility, but not a strong preference at this point. 


My reserved nature and tendency to plan meticulously mean I wouldn't make a hasty purchase decision based solely on an advertisement.  I'd likely research more about the product before committing.
