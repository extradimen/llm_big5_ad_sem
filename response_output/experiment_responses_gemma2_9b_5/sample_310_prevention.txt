**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its direct message, I don't particularly like it. It lacks creativity and feels a bit manipulative by playing on fears of looking dull and feeling tired. I also don't find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. My cautious nature (strong agreement with "get nervous easily" and "worry a lot") might make me hesitant to try something new without more information about its ingredients and effects. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
