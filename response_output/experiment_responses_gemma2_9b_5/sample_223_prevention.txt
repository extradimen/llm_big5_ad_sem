**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in terms of getting a message across, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (1) or something I particularly *like* (2). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially *try* the product (1) and I might even *intend* to purchase it (1) if I see it in a store. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it based on this ad alone (2). 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who is talkative but not necessarily outgoing, I'm more likely to be swayed by ads that appeal to my sense of curiosity and usefulness rather than those that rely heavily on emotional appeals. The ad's focus on feeling tired and looking dull doesn't particularly resonate with me, as I tend to be emotionally stable and not easily fazed by such concerns.  I might be more inclined to try the product if it promised a specific benefit, like increased energy or improved focus, rather than simply avoiding negative feelings.
