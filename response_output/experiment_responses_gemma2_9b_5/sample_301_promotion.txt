**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a certain originality that would make me strongly agree with any of the statements.  The claims are common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being blown away by the ad, the promise of feeling energized and looking good is something I'd consider trying. The "stay energized" part particularly appeals to me as a student who needs to stay focused. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd likely compare it to other options and read reviews before making a decision.
