**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider trying this product (3), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (1) nor actively seek it out (1). My hesitation stems from the ad's somewhat negative framing. I'd need more information about the product's benefits and ingredients before making a decision.
