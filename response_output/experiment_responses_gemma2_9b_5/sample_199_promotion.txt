**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is something that might interest me. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the idea, I'd likely try the product first before committing to a full purchase.  My age group often relies more on word-of-mouth recommendations and personal experience before making decisions about new products.
