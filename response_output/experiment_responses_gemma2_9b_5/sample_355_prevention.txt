  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive."  The language is a bit blunt ("feel tired and look dull") and doesn't really appeal to me emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because of my talkative and outgoing nature, I might mention this drink to friends, which could lead to trying it (score 1 for "try").  I am not someone who meticulously plans things out or does thorough research before buying, so I'd likely consider purchasing it if it came up in conversation or seemed easily accessible (score 3 for "consider"). However, the ad itself doesn't make me *intend* to buy it right away.


Let me know if you have any other questions!
