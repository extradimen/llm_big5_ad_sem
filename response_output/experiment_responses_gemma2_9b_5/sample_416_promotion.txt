**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is generic and doesn't really stand out to me. However, because I tend to be original and come up with new ideas,  I might be curious enough to try the product. It wouldn't be my first choice, but I would consider buying it if it was on sale or if I needed a quick energy boost.
