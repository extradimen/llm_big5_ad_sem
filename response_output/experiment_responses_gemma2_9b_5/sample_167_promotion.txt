**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is fairly generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further information about its ingredients, taste, and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
