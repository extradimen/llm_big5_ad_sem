**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't particularly catchy or memorable, but it does present a clear message.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not inherently interesting, but the promise of energy and looking good might pique some curiosity.
    * **Good (3):** It gets the point across effectively - promoting energy and appearance benefits. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would stand out as particularly attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately inclined to buy the product based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if there was a compelling reason or offer, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
    * **Consider (3):** If the product were recommended by someone I trust or if I had a specific need for energy, I might consider purchasing it. 



As a reserved individual with few artistic interests and a preference for emotional stability, this type of advertisement doesn't strongly resonate with me. The focus on outward appearance and quick energy boosts isn't particularly appealing to my personality.
