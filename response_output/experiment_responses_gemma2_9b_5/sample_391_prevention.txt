**Explanation of Scores:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it in a positive way.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I might try it if I see it in store or come across a good promotion. I would definitely consider buying it depending on other factors like price and reviews. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, I'm drawn to ads that suggest a positive impact on well-being.  The ad's focus on feeling tired and looking dull plays on these concerns. However, the "without this drink" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and lacks specific details about the product's benefits. My neutral attitude towards planning and doing thorough research means I wouldn't rush into a purchase based solely on this ad.
