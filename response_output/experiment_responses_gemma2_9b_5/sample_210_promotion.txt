**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it gets the point across. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to someone my age, especially if I feel like energy levels are dipping.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a straightforward ad without any gimmicks or overly bold claims.
    * **Attractive (1):** The visual appeal isn't particularly strong, and it doesn't make me want to seek out the product immediately.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try this drink if I saw it at the store and was looking for a pick-me-up. 
    * **Try (1):**  It's likely something I'd pick up once out of curiosity. 
    * **Consider (3):** Given my tendency to worry about things, I might be more receptive to an ad that highlighted the drink's ability to reduce stress or anxiety, which would be a bigger draw for me than just energy and appearance.
