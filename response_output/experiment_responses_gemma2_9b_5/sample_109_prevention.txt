**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My initial interest would likely depend on seeing more information about the product's ingredients and actual benefits beyond simply avoiding tiredness.
