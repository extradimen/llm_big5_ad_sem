**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear rather than appealing to my values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the ad's approach, I'm unlikely to *intend* to purchase it right away. However, I might *try* it out of curiosity if I saw it in a store or received a sample. I would definitely *consider* buying it if there was more information about the product's ingredients and benefits that aligned with my values (health, natural ingredients).
