**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull is relatable, so that part is somewhat interesting.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the message across, but it's not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I find the typical "you'll look dull" type of ad a bit manipulative and not very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider it if I was already feeling tired or needed a pick-me-up, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I might give it a shot if the situation called for it.
    * **Consider (3):** This is the most likely outcome. I would probably think about it if I saw it again or if someone recommended it, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it.



As a blue-collar worker who prioritizes practicality and tends to be careless, I'm more likely to be swayed by ads that highlight tangible benefits or offer practical solutions rather than emotional appeals. This ad relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate as strongly with me.
