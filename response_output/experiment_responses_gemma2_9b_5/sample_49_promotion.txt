**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly grab me. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising, so they don't feel unique or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to purchase this product because I like trying new things. However, I wouldn't be overly excited about it. My decision would depend on the price, availability, and any further information I could gather about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness. 


My personality traits of being talkative, outgoing, helpful, and trusting might make me more receptive to social marketing or word-of-mouth recommendations for this product. Conversely, my tendency towards carelessness and worry might make me hesitant to try something new without careful consideration.
