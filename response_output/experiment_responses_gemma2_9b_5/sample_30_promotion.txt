**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common and not very unique.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because I tend to be open to new things, but my worry about products claiming unrealistic results makes me hesitant to fully intend a purchase. I would likely consider buying it if there were testimonials or proof of its effectiveness.
