**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad inherently *bad*, it doesn't really grab my attention. It relies on fear tactics ("look dull") which isn't very appealing to me.  I think it's decent in its construction, but not particularly memorable or creative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because I worry about things like looking tired. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without knowing more about the drink itself and what makes it effective.  I'd probably look for reviews or try a smaller sample first.
