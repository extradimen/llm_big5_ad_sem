**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I don't personally like the simplistic wording or find it particularly attractive.  I think it's a decent advertisement, but not outstanding.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I am always on the lookout for something to improve my appearance and energy levels, I would likely try this product.  While I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright, the ad piques my curiosity enough to give it a shot. I might consider buying it again depending on the experience.
