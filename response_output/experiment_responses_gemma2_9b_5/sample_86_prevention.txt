**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it presents a clear benefit (feeling energized and looking vibrant), I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* or *like* it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't resonate with my preference for more factual and less emotionally charged advertising. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase the product and *try* it because I am always looking for ways to boost my energy levels and feel my best. However, I wouldn't immediately *consider* buying it without further research into its ingredients and potential side effects. My tendency to be cautious and worry sometimes prevents me from making impulsive purchases.
