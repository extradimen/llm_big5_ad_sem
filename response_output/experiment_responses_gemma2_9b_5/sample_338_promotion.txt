**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it clearly states a benefit (stay energized and look your best), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  

My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and the claims about "looking your best" feel superficial.  

However, I do *intend* to purchase this product because the claim of staying energized appeals to me. I *will try* it out, but I'll likely only consider buying it again if it actually delivers on its promise.
