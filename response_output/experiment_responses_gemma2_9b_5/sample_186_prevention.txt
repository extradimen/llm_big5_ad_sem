**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull). However, I don't think it's particularly creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *more likely* to consider buying this drink. I might even try it out of curiosity. While I agree with the message, my worry about potential side effects might prevent me from actively seeking it out.  My tendency to be careful (agreeing that I "tend to be careless") could make me more cautious about trying new things without extensive research.
