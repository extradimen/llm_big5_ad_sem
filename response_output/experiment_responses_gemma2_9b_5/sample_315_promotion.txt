**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit general and not very unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my reserved nature and tendency to be careless, I might try this drink once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I would definitely consider buying it if someone recommended it or offered me a good deal.
