**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in terms of conveying a clear message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is somewhat generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:**  I might be inclined to try the product due to its claim of providing energy and enhancing appearance. 
    * **Try to buy:** This aligns with my initial interest. I wouldn't make it a priority, but if I saw it readily available, I'd likely give it a shot.
    * **Consider buying:**  This is the most probable outcome. The ad piques my curiosity, but I would need more information about the product's ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision to purchase.
