**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not groundbreaking or particularly exciting, but it's clear and conveys its message effectively.  I think it's interesting enough to catch my eye.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad focuses on feeling energized and looking good, which are things I value, I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright without further research or knowing more about its ingredients and price. I'd definitely consider buying it based on this ad alone.
