**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear tactics, which isn't my preferred way of being persuaded.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying this product. However, as someone who worries a lot, I might be susceptible to believing the claims about feeling tired and looking dull without it. This could lead me to try it at least once. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
