**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on my desire to feel energized and look my best. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *good*.  It's a bit generic and relies on common fears about looking tired. The "dull" description also feels a bit harsh.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I'm likely to *try* this product because the idea of feeling more energetic is appealing. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it long-term without knowing more about its ingredients and effects. I'd *consider* buying it if I had a positive experience with the trial.
