**Explanation:**

While I find the ad appealing and interesting (scores of 4 and 3 respectively), I'm not entirely convinced by its claims. The phrase "look your best every day" feels a bit vague and potentially manipulative.  As someone who trusts others easily, I would want more concrete information about what this drink actually does and how it helps people achieve their best appearance.

However, my desire to stay energized is strong, and the ad plays on that feeling. Therefore, I'd be inclined to try the product (scores of 1 for both "intend" and "try") before making a final decision about whether I want to purchase it regularly (score of 2 for "consider").
