}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  While not immediately grabbing my attention, the ad is simple and conveys a clear message.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that might pique my interest. 
    * **Good (2):** It's functional in its design and gets the point across.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually stimulating or particularly memorable for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm leaning towards trying this drink. The idea of feeling energized could be helpful. 
    * **Try (1):** As mentioned, I wouldn't immediately buy it but would likely give it a shot if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd seriously consider buying it again if I found it to be genuinely effective and enjoyable.



My personality traits like being outgoing and helpful might lead me to try new things, even if they don't initially grab my attention. However, as someone who values trustworthiness and carefulness, I'd want to see some evidence or testimonials before committing to regular purchases.
