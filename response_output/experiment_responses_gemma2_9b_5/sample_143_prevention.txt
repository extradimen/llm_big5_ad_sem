**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* to some extent (it plays on common anxieties), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "dull" descriptor feels a bit overblown and not very compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to *try* this product out of curiosity, and I could potentially *intend* to purchase it if I had a genuine need for an energy boost and perceived it as effective. However, I wouldn't automatically *consider* buying it based on this ad alone.
