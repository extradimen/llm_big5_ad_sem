**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I think the ad is interesting and somewhat attractive, it's not something that blows me away. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial, which is why I rated "good" as 2. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on wanting to look good and feel energized, which are things I value (especially at my age), I'm more inclined to try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away without knowing more about the product and ingredients.
