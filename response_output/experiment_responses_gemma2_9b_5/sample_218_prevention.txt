**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying the product because I worry about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it further before making a decision.
