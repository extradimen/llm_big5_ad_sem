**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of staying energized and looking your best appealing, I don't think the ad itself is particularly creative or memorable. The claims seem common to many similar products.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I'm always searching for solutions that will help me feel better. This ad triggers that desire. I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it long-term without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
