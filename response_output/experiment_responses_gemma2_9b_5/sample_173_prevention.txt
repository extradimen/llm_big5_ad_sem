**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product (3) based on curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or actively seek it out (1). My active imagination (a key trait) might lead me to think of alternative ways to combat tiredness and dullness without relying on a specific drink.
