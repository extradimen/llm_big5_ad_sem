  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad fairly interesting (2) and think it's good in a general sense (3). The claim of "looking your best" is appealing to someone wanting to feel confident. However,  I wouldn't call it particularly attractive (2) or that I *like* it (3). 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad appeals to me on a surface level, I am likely to try this product (1) and intend to purchase it (1). The "stay energized" part is tempting.  

**However**, my score of "2" for being reserved and my tendency to be careless (Strongly Agree) might make me ultimately not follow through with the purchase.
