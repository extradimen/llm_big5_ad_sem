**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, as I tend to be original and like trying new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, and I would definitely consider the product's ingredients and reviews before making a final decision. My worry about feeling tired and dull is generally high due to my personality, so this ad could resonate with that anxiety.
