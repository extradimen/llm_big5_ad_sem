**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it very *likeable* or *attractive*.  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am leaning towards purchasing this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, especially since I tend to worry about these things. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd likely *try* it after seeing more information or reviews.
