**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common concerns about energy levels and appearance. 
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in terms of its straightforward message, it lacks creativity.
    * I don't find it particularly **attractive (2)** or  **likeable (2)**.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I would **intend to purchase (1)** this product because the ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. 
    *  I'd also **try to buy (1)** it out of curiosity. However, I'd likely **consider (2)** other options before making a final decision as I tend to worry a lot and want to research thoroughly.
