**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me because it taps into a common concern about feeling tired and dull. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  I find the idea of a drink preventing these feelings intriguing, but not necessarily compelling.
    * **Good (2):**  While it's simple, the message gets across. I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if I saw it in a store and was feeling tired, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
    * **Consider (3):**  If the product had positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust, I would definitely consider buying it.
