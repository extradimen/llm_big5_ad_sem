**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims are common and not particularly unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away without further research or seeing reviews. I would definitely consider buying it if it seemed effective and affordable. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
