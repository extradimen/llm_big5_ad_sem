**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I get nervous easily and worry about making the right decisions, I might try the product once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more convincing evidence about its effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if a friend recommended it or if there was a good sale.
