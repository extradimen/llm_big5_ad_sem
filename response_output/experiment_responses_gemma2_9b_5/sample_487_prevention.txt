**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's decent overall (score 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities rather than presenting genuine benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider purchasing the product (score 3) because the ad does make me somewhat aware of a potential problem (feeling tired and looking dull). However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it (score 1) or even try it (score 1) right away.  I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps some independent reviews before making a decision. 



My personality traits, such as being helpful, thorough, and planning-oriented, might lead me to research the product further if I felt it could genuinely address my concerns. However, my reserved nature and tendency towards distrust would make me cautious about simply accepting the ad's claims at face value.
