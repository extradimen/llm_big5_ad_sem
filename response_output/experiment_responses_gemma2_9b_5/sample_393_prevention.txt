Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message somewhat relatable (everyone wants to feel energetic and look their best), it relies on fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). This makes it less appealing than an ad that focuses on positive benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely research more about its ingredients and compare it to other options before making a decision.
