**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The scare tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative to me.  I value honesty and transparency in advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I might consider buying the product if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it. My personality leans towards being cautious and not easily swayed by marketing tactics. The ad's focus on fear rather than genuine benefit doesn't resonate with me.
