**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less inclined to consider it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try this product because the ad plays on my anxieties (worrying a lot). However, I'm not immediately sold on purchasing it. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before deciding to buy it.
