**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. It seems like a common marketing message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I'd likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases. There are many similar products out there, so I need to be convinced this one stands out.
