**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad decent. The message is clear and simple, which appeals to me as someone who prefers straightforward communication. While not overly exciting, it piques my interest enough to learn more. I wouldn't call it "attractive" though, as it lacks a personal touch or any unique elements that stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially given my worries about getting older. While I'm generally trusting, I wouldn't commit to purchasing without trying it first.
