**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't feel very original or eye-catching to me.  It relies on a common fear tactic that doesn't strongly resonate with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the fear appeal, I might try this product out of curiosity or even consider buying it if there were no alternatives. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.  



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
