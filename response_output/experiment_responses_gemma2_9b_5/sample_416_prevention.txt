**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me *consider* trying the product because it plays on my fear of feeling tired and looking dull. However, I'm not sure if I would *intend* to buy it or even *try* it without more information about the product itself. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
