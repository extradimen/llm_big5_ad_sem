Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I think the ad is interesting and attractive because it appeals to wanting to look good and have energy. It's simple and gets the point across. While not groundbreaking, it's effective enough.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I would intend to buy this product and try it out based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to continuing to buy it unless I found it genuinely effective and liked the taste. The "consider" score reflects that there are other factors (like price and availability) that would influence my long-term purchasing decision.
