**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I like the ad:  While not overly captivating, it's straightforward and gets the point across. (3)
    * Interesting: The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing enough. (2)
    * Good: It effectively conveys a simple message with a clear benefit. (4)
    * Attractive:  The ad itself isn't visually stunning or particularly memorable. (2)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Intend to purchase: The ad makes me want to try it, especially the "look your best" aspect. (1)
    * Try: I'd likely pick up a bottle to give it a shot based on the ad alone. (3)
    * Consider:  If I see it at a good price or in a convenient location, I'll definitely consider buying it. (5) 



**Reasoning:** As someone who is outgoing and sociable and values looking their best, the promise of staying energized and enhancing appearance resonates with me. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it without trying it first. The ad itself isn't particularly groundbreaking or compelling, but it does pique my interest enough to consider a purchase.
