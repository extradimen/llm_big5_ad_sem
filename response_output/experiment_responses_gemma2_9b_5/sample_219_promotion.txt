**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I would likely consider buying it if I saw it in a store or needed an energy boost. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
