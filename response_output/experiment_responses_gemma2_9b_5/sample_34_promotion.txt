**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, and I would likely consider other options before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
