**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I am likely to consider buying this product (3). The potential benefits of feeling more energetic and vibrant could appeal to me, especially considering my tendency to worry and get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately (1) or actively try to buy it (2).  I would probably do further research and compare other options before making a decision.
