**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (score of 4), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem "good" in a lasting way.  I'm more likely to remember seeing it than actively engaging with it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product (score of 3). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out right now. My tendency to worry (agree) might make me hesitate before trying something new without more information about its ingredients or potential side effects.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
