**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" angle appeals to my tendency to worry (agree with "I worry a lot") but it feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because it plays on my fear of looking dull, something I likely care about as an older individual in a managerial role. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase or try it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. My careful nature (agree with "I do a thorough job") would lead me to research before making a decision.
