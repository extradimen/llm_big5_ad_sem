**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.  The "prevention" angle isn't very compelling either, as I tend to be reserved and prioritize careful planning over reacting to potential negative outcomes.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I might try this product out of curiosity since I am open to new things and find the ad interesting, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a definite purchase decision based on this advertisement alone.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
