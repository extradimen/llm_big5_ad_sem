**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The message is common and doesn't stand out much.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad. I like the idea of a drink that keeps me energized and helps me look my best. However, I would probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
