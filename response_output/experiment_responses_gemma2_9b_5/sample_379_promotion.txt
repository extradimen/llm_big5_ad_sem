Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it promises something relevant to daily life - energy and looking good. While not particularly catchy or memorable, it does pique my curiosity.  I wouldn't say I **like (2)** it, nor do I think it's particularly **good (2)** or **attractive (1)**.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a blue-collar worker with a tight budget, I would **intend (1)** to purchase this drink if it were affordable and offered genuine benefits.  I might even **try (1)** it based on the ad's claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily  **consider (3)** buying it as a regular habit unless it proved truly effective and reasonably priced. 


My personality traits - being reserved, sometimes careless, and prone to nervousness - might make me hesitant to try something new without more concrete evidence of its effectiveness.
