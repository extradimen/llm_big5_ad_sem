  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 4]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and makes a clear claim, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. However, I find it interesting in a "what does it actually do?" kind of way.  I believe it's decent at its job of conveying the product's purpose. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my personality traits (reserved, trusting), I wouldn't jump to buy this product based on an ad alone.  However, if someone recommended it to me or I saw it in a trusted store, I might try it. It's certainly something I would consider buying.
