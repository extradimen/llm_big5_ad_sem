**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. The message is straightforward but lacks creativity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product.  I wouldn't immediately buy it based on this ad alone, as I need more information about its ingredients and benefits. 


**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response to the ad:

* **Reserved:** I'm not easily swayed by persuasive advertising.
* **Helpful & Unselfish:**  I'm more likely to be interested in products that genuinely help others or solve problems. The ad focuses on personal appearance, which isn't a top priority for me.
* **Active Imagination & Original:**  The ad's message is quite common and doesn't spark much creativity or innovation within me. 
* **Worry:**  I tend to be cautious about new products and might worry about potential side effects without more information.
