**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly captivating (hence not a "strongly like" or "strongly attractive"), it does pique my curiosity (interesting) and seems to present a valid concern (good). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad plays on my worry about looking dull, which aligns with my tendency to worry a lot. I'd likely try the product at least once based on this fear, but wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without further information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
