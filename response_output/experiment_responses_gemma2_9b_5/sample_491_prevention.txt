**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear tactics which I'm not very receptive to. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would consider trying this product based solely on the advertisement. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it without further research and perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
