**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language ("tired," "dull") feels a bit simplistic and fear-mongering.  The wording doesn't resonate with my values or concerns. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might *intend* to purchase this product if I found myself feeling tired or lacking energy. I'd likely *try* it once based on curiosity rather than strong conviction. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it regularly unless I experienced noticeable positive effects.
