**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **somewhat appealing**. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is relatable. 
    * It's not particularly **unique or memorable**, hence the lower scores for "interesting" and "attractive".
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I am likely to **buy this product**.  The claim of increased energy appeals to me as a managerial employee with a busy schedule.
    * While I would likely try it, my initial intention leans towards purchasing due to the practical benefit it promises.
    * I wouldn't necessarily consider it if there were better alternatives or other products that addressed my specific needs more directly.
