**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't very appealing to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because of the promise of feeling more energetic and less "dull." However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. The consideration score is higher because I have an active imagination and could envision myself benefiting from the product, but I need more convincing.
