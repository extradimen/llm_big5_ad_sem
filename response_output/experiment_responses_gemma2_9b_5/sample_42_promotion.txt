Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. I think it's *good* in its simplicity and directness. However, I don't personally *like* the ad or find it particularly *attractive*. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I'm intrigued by the promise of the drink, my personality traits suggest I might not follow through with a purchase.  I'm not very impulsive (strongly disagree with "make plans and follow through") and tend to be careful ("careless" is neutral). So, while I might *intend* to try it or even *try* to buy it, I wouldn't necessarily actively *consider* it before weighing other options.
