**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't grab my full attention. It feels a bit generic and relies on common claims about energy and appearance.
* **Purchase Intention:**  As someone who values originality and coming up with new ideas, I'm likely to try this drink.  I'd want to see what makes it unique before committing to regular purchases, though. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
