**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "likeable" or "attractive" to me, I find it interesting because it plays on my concerns about appearing tired and dull.  I believe it's a decent advertisement in its simplicity and directness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would intend to purchase this product and would likely try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it again unless there were strong testimonials or reviews indicating its effectiveness. My personality traits lead me to be cautious and reserved about trying new things, especially when they relate to my appearance. The ad's appeal is based on a fear of looking tired and dull, which resonates with my desire to appear put-together, but I wouldn't be impulsive in purchasing it.
