**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The phrasing "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a firm decision.
