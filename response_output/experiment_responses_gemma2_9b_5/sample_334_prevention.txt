**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit exaggerated and doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or actively seek it out. I would probably need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
