**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on creating anxiety rather than highlighting positive aspects of the product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I'm slightly more inclined to try the product because I worry about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further information or a stronger appeal. I would definitely consider buying it if there was a compelling reason or offer.
