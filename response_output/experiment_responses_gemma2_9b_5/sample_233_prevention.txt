**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses fear-based tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), I find it somewhat interesting because it targets a common concern (looking tired). However, I don't personally like it or find it attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I wouldn't immediately purchase this product due to my tendency towards distrust and carefulness. However, if I were feeling particularly concerned about looking tired, I might consider trying it.
