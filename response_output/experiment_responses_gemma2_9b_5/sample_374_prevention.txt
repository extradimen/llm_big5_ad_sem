**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It relies on a bit of scare tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find manipulative. I'm not particularly attracted to this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me slightly curious about the product, so I might consider trying it.  However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or even try it right away. My anxiety (which is high, as per my profile) might make me hesitant to try something new. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
