**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) if I saw positive reviews or needed an energy boost, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I would definitely consider buying it (3) in those circumstances.


My personality traits likely influence these scores. As someone who worries a lot and prefers to be thorough, I might be cautious about trying new products without more information. The ad's focus on negative consequences doesn't appeal to my emotionally stable nature.
