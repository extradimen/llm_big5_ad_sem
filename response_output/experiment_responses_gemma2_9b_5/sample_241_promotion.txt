{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing because it promises benefits I value (energy and looking good),  it doesn't particularly grab my attention or inspire me to think highly of it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad is likely enough to make me try the product. I might even intend to buy it if it's reasonably priced and available. However, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize purchasing it over other needs or wants. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
