**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent advertisement overall, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit dramatic and doesn't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to potentially try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I'd probably consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a chance to try it first.
