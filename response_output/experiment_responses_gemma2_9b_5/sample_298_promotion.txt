**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at promoting a product, I don't personally find it very *attractive*.  The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial to me. Also, the language doesn't resonate strongly with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to purchase this product if I was feeling particularly tired or low on energy. However, I wouldn't actively *try* to buy it.  I would definitely *consider* buying it if I saw a good deal or needed a boost, but I wouldn't seek it out. 


My personality traits of being reserved, worried, and emotionally stable likely influence my response to the ad. The promise of "staying energized" might appeal to my worry about feeling tired, but the emphasis on looking your best doesn't align with my values.
