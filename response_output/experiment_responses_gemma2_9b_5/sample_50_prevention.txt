**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less trusting.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try the product based on curiosity, especially if I see it advertised in a more appealing way. However, I'm not immediately planning to purchase it. The ad hasn't convinced me enough that I need this drink.
