**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it promises both energy and appearance benefits, which are things that appeal to me as a busy office worker. However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly unique in its messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the ad, I'm more likely to try the product than definitively purchase it. My "careless" tendencies and need for thoroughness might lead me to research other options before making a decision.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
