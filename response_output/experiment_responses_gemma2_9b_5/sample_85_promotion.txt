**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention ("like" or "attractive"). I appreciate the simplicity of the message and its focus on energy and appearance, which are relevant to some people.  However, my reserved nature and tendency towards careful planning means I wouldn't immediately jump into purchasing a new product based solely on this ad. 

The ad piques my curiosity enough to at least "try" the product, but I would likely research it further before committing to a purchase.   I might consider buying it if reviews are positive or if there is a promotion that aligns with my budgeting style.
