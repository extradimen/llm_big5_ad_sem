**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting, it doesn't strike me as particularly remarkable or attractive. The message is clear and concise.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. I would likely purchase this product and even try it out soon. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it without more information about the product itself (ingredients, taste, etc.).
