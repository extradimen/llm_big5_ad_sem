**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent advertisement, I don't personally feel a strong connection to it. It doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product based on the ad alone. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with some personal desires, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd probably wait for more information or reviews before making a full commitment.
