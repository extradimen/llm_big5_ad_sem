**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive on some level due to its direct appeal to potential negative consequences (tiredness, dullness), it doesn't resonate with me strongly.  The "prevention" angle is a bit manipulative, playing on fear rather than genuine benefit. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of the ad's focus on negatives and my tendency to worry, I'd likely consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't be immediately driven to buy it without more information about its actual benefits and ingredients. I tend to research products before purchasing.
