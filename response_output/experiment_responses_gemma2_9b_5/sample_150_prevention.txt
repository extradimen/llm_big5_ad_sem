**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it attractive.  The "prevention" angle appeals to my desire for novelty and creativity, as I dislike feeling dull or tired. However, my tendency to be careless and disagree with the statement that I do a thorough job means I might not pay close attention to details like ingredients or long-term effects. 

Therefore, while I intend to purchase the product and will likely try it, I'm not fully committed to buying it due to potential reservations about its effectiveness and my own personal habits.
