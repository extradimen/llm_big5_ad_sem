**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simple message about feeling tired and dull piques my curiosity. I wonder what the drink offers to combat these feelings. 
    * **3 (Good):**  While it's a straightforward approach, the ad effectively conveys its core message. It targets common insecurities about energy levels and appearance.
    * **2 (Like):**  I wouldn't say I "like" it in the sense of finding it particularly creative or enjoyable. 
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad lacks any visual or stylistic elements that would make me find it attractive. It's quite basic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the product, but I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it right away.
    * **1 (Try):**  I might be tempted to give it a try if I happened to see it at a store or encounter more information about it. 
    * **3 (Consider):** The ad has planted a seed of consideration, but many other factors would influence my final decision (price, reviews, personal preferences).
