**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I wouldn't call it *likeable* or *attractive*. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't particularly resonate with my emotionally stable personality.  I'm also not one for being swayed by overly simple solutions to complex issues (like tiredness).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm willing to *intend* and *try* this product because the ad piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't immediately *consider* buying it without further research. My reserved nature means I prefer to carefully evaluate products before making a purchase.
