**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product.  I'd likely be persuaded if there were more details about its benefits or if I saw testimonials from people who found it helpful. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone.
