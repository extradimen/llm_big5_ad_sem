**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The use of fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very appealing to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I'd probably need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
