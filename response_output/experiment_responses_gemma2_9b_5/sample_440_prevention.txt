**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if I don't personally struggle with it.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The ad piques my curiosity because it implies a solution to these feelings. 
    * **Good (2):** While the message is clear, it doesn't feel particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging enough for me to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am somewhat inclined to try the product based on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I might purchase it if I saw it in a store or received a recommendation from someone I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** However, I wouldn't actively seek out this product or make a purchase decision solely based on this advertisement.  The ad doesn't convince me strongly enough to do so.
