**Explanation:**

While the ad is somewhat interesting (score of 3) and I believe it's okay (score of 2), I don't find it particularly attractive (score of 1).  I do think it might make me try the product (scores of 1 and 1), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I might consider buying it (score of 2) if I were feeling tired or if I saw other positive reviews. 


The ad plays on my potential insecurities by suggesting a link between this drink and looking "dull."  This could be persuasive, but I generally don't fall for these types of emotional appeals easily. My personality traits like being reserved and disagreeing with the statement that I am outgoing likely make me less susceptible to ads relying heavily on social pressure.
