**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I don't find the ad particularly likeable, good, or attractive. While it might be mildly interesting because of the promise of feeling energized and looking good, it doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product or even try it. The claims about energy and appearance don't resonate with me personally. However, I could consider buying it if I were facing a specific situation where I felt the need for an energy boost, like before a big event or during a particularly stressful time. 


My reserved personality and tendency to be distrustful make me less likely to jump on marketing claims without more information. The ad's focus on superficial benefits doesn't appeal to my lack of artistic interests and preference for practicality.
