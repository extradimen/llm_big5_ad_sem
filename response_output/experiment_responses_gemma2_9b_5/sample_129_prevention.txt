**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. My distrust nature would likely lead me to research alternatives and reviews before making a decision.
