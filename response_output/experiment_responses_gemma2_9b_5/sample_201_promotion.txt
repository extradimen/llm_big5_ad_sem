Explanation:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is fairly generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try the product because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it after trying it or reading more reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
