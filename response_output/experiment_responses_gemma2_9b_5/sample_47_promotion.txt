**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. It lacks specifics about what makes the drink energizing or how it helps one look their best.  The claim seems generic and doesn't grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the vague claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase or even try the product. However, if I saw more concrete information about its ingredients or benefits, I might consider buying it in the future. My worry tendency might make me hesitant to try something new without more reassurance.
