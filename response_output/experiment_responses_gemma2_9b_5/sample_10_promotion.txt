**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-made.  I give it a "good" rating because it gets its message across clearly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and like to be original, I might try this drink to see if it genuinely helps me feel energized and confident. However, I'm not sure I would make it a regular purchase without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
