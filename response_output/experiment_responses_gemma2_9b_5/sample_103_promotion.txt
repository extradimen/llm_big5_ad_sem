  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is clear and makes a simple promise, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough to read but not compellingly good or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of "staying energized and looking your best" does appeal to me.  I'm likely to try the product based on that, and might even intend to buy it depending on its price and availability. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further information or trying it first. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
