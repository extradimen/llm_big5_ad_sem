**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. While it's not particularly attractive to me, it does grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad appeals to my desire for feeling energized and looking good. However, I might only "try" it first before committing to a full purchase. I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without trying it. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who values making plans and following through (strongly agree), and who is original and comes up with new ideas (strongly agree), I'm always looking for ways to improve my energy levels and appearance.  The ad plays on this by suggesting a direct link between the drink and feeling less tired and more vibrant. 

While I might not necessarily be swayed by the "dull" imagery, the promise of increased energy aligns with my desire to perform well and feel confident. My tendency to be careless (agree) might lead me to experiment with different products like this one, but I wouldn't jump into a full commitment without trying it first.
