**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, as it presents a straightforward benefit (energy and appearance). However, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive* or that I *like* it.  It's functional in its message.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my financial status and personality traits (I make plans and follow through), I would likely *intend* to purchase this product after some research. I wouldn't just blindly buy it, but the ad piques my interest enough to investigate further.
