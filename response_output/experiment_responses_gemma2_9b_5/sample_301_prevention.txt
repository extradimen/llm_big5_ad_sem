**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or likeable. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's approach, I might be tempted to try the product.  The promise of feeling more energetic and looking less "dull" could appeal to me, especially if I'm facing a situation where those qualities are important. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly or consider it a necessity.
