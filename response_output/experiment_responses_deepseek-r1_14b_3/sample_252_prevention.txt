Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let me break it down.

First, their demographic profile: They're a single male from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker, earning about 26-35 million VND monthly. That's interesting because despite having a higher education, they're in a blue-collar job, which might mean they value practicality or perhaps are looking for ways to improve their lifestyle.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Neutral (so maybe not too outgoing but not shy either)
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
- Generally trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Agree
- Plans and follows through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worry a lot: Agree (contradicts the previous point)
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree

So this person is methodical, plans well, thorough, trustworthy, not very helpful or unselfish. They have an active mind for original ideas but aren't artistically inclined.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

I need to assess their attitude toward the ad and their purchase intention.

For the ad's effectiveness:

1. I like the ad.
2. Interesting.
3. Good.
4. Attractive.

They're not very outgoing or talkative but agree on being talkative. They value trust, so if the ad is trustworthy, it might resonate. The message targets tiredness and dull appearance, which are relatable for someone who's working hard (blue-collar), perhaps looking to maintain energy and image.

But since they don't have high artistic interests or imagination, the ad needs to be clear and straightforward. If the ad is just a simple statement without creative flair, it might not capture their interest as 'interesting' or 'good'.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
2. Try to buy.
3. Consider buying.

They plan thoroughly, follow through, so if they see value, they might intend to buy. However, the ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without it. They worry a lot but are not emotionally stable, which could make them cautious about products that promise too much. Also, being original and coming up with new ideas might mean they're critical of generic ads.

But since trust is high, if they believe the drink works, they might intend to try it, especially if it's presented as something they need to maintain their image or energy.

Scoring:

Ad attitude: Maybe 3-4 for like, interesting; lower for good and attractive.

Purchase intention: Might score higher on trying and considering but not strongly intending unless convinced.
