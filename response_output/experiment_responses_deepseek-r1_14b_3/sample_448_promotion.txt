Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their profile and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a pretty common type of ad, targeting people who want energy and maybe some added benefits like looking good.

Now, considering the person's demographics: they're from China, male, between 50-59 years old, high school education, not working, divorced, and has a decent income (36 million to 45 million VND monthly). That’s a pretty comfortable income level but not extremely high. They might be looking for something that fits their lifestyle, maybe convenience or health.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree (so they're more on the outgoing side)
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Agree
- Thorough job: Agree
- Plans and follows through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Agree
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Few artistic interests: Agree

So putting this together, he's someone who is outgoing but not reserved. He values being helpful and unselfish, which might make him more community-oriented. However, he's not very trusting and sometimes rude, which could affect how he views ads.

He’s thorough in his work and makes plans, so he probably likes ads that are clear and to the point. But he can be careless and a bit nervous, maybe indicating some anxiety about trying new products. He is emotionally stable but not particularly high on worrying, which might mean he's less concerned about negative outcomes.

He has few artistic interests, which suggests he might not respond well to ads that emphasize aesthetics too much. The ad mentions looking good, so maybe that's a point he might not connect with as strongly.

Now, evaluating the ad: It focuses on energy and looking good. Energy is something that's relatable across ages, but for someone in their 50s, maybe they're more concerned about health than appearance? Or perhaps they still value looking good as part of self-care.

Since he’s outgoing, he might appreciate a drink that helps him stay energized to socialize or be active. But the part about looking good might not resonate as much if his artistic interests are low.

He’s not trusting, so does the ad come across as credible? The message is straightforward, which he appreciates because he's thorough and likes follow-through. However, being mistrusting could make him skeptical of exaggerated claims.

His tendency to be rude sometimes might mean he prefers ads that aren't overly pushy or manipulative. The current ad seems positive but not too over the top.

Looking at his personality, he's emotionally stable, so maybe stress-related messages don't affect him as much. But since he worries little, perhaps the ad doesn't target any anxiety points, which is neutral for him.

Now, for the attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. – He might not strongly like it because the looking good part doesn't hit home, and he's mistrusting of claims. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting – The message is standard but could be somewhat interesting due to the energy aspect. Maybe a 4.
3. Good – It’s clear and positive, so maybe a 5.
4. Attractive – Not very attractive because it targets appearance, which he's neutral on. Maybe a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend – He might not have a strong intent unless convinced. Probably a 3.
2. Try – Slightly more openness to trying it if others do, maybe a 4.
3. Consider – Might consider it, so a 5.

I think his scores would be on the lower to middle range because while he has some positive traits that could make him respond well, factors like mistrust and low artistic interest might temper his enthusiasm.

**Ad Attitude Scores:**

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. I intend to purchase this product. – 3
2. I will try to buy this product. – 4
