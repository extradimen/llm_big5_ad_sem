Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to score my reaction to this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down based on my demographics and personality.

First, considering I'm a female student from China with a postgraduate degree, my age is under 20, so I'm probably in my late teens or early twenties. My monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND, which is about $1,128 to $1,547 USD. That's relatively high for a student, maybe due to family support or part-time work.

Looking at the ad itself: It's making me think that without this drink, I might feel tired and look dull. So it's positioning the product as something that can help me stay energized and look good. Since I'm a student, balancing studies with other activities could be tiring, so energy is probably important to me.

My personality traits: Talkative (Agree), outgoing (Agree), reserved (Neutral). So I tend to be social, which means looking good and being energetic might matter in my daily life. Being helpful (Agree) suggests I care about how I present myself to others. Trusting? Not so much; the ad is trying to sell me something, so I'm cautious.

I don't find this ad particularly interesting because it's a common message for energy drinksâ€”everyone feels tired sometimes. However, since I'm outgoing and value my appearance, maybe there's some appeal here.

The wording is direct but not overly engaging. It doesn't make me think much beyond the basic benefit of staying alert and looking good. But I also worry about the credibility because the ad feels a bit generic. I don't have any strong feelings either way towards it.

On purchase intention: The message isn't compelling enough for me to immediately want to buy it, but since it's about energy and appearance, I might consider it if I'm feeling tired or need an energy boost. Trying it once isn't out of the question, especially if others find it helpful. Considering buying is possible, but not a definite.

So, putting this all together, my feelings towards the ad are neutral to slightly positive, but my intent to purchase isn't strong.
