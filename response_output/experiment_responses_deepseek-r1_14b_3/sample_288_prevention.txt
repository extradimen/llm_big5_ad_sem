Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: they're a Chinese male in his 30s-39s with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. They earn over 46 million VND monthly, which is quite high for Vietnam, so they might be in a senior position or have a specialized skill set despite the blue-collar role.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative and outgoing: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree
- Generally trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Disagree
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Artistic interests: Strongly Agree

So this person is extroverted, not reserved, and somewhat careless but helpful. They don't trust people much, aren't very thorough, and make plans but don't follow through. They get nervous sometimes but don't worry a lot, are emotionally unstable, have a low imagination, originality-wise they're neutral, and have few artistic interests.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Now, analyzing the ad's message. It seems to target fatigue and appearance, suggesting that without the drink, one might feel tired (physical symptom) and look dull (aesthetic concern). 

Given his personality traits:

1. He's outgoing, so looking good is probably important for social interactions.
2. He's careless, which might mean he doesn't prioritize products unless they offer significant benefits.
3. He's not very thorough, so the ad needs to be clear and direct.
4. His tendency to make plans but not follow through suggests he might need a strong motivation to actually buy something.

The ad is short and directly addresses potential negative outcomes (feeling tired and looking dull), which could appeal to someone who values their appearance and energy levels for social interactions. However, the lack of detail might be a downside because he's not very thorough but also somewhat careless, so maybe the brevity works in this case.

For his ad attitude:

- Does he like it? The message is clear but might feel too simplistic or manipulative given his tendency to be critical. Maybe 4/7.
- Interesting? It relates to looking and feeling good, which could be interesting for someone social, so maybe a 5.
- Good as an ad? Not sure if the message is compelling enough; perhaps 4.
- Attractive? The visual aspect of not wanting to look dull might make it attractive, so maybe 6.

For purchase intention:

- Intend to buy: He's somewhat careless but also helpful. Maybe he doesn't feel the need strongly enough yet, so 3.
- Try to buy: If the ad makes him think about it, maybe a 4.
- Consider buying: It might make him think, so perhaps a higher score here at 5.

I'm not entirely sure about these scores, but considering his traits, he's more likely to be swayed by clear messages related to social appearance and energy, even though he's somewhat careless. He might need a bit more convincing, hence lower intent but moderate consideration.
