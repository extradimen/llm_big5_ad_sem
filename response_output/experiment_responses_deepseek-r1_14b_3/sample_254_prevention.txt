Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, considering my age (50-59) and being an office worker, maybe the ad is targeting people who are looking to stay energetic and presentable at work or in social settings. The statement suggests that without the drink, one might feel tired, which could affect their performance or appearance.

I have a postgraduate degree, so I'm probably analytical and value credible information. However, the ad seems a bit vagueâ€”does it mean the drink will make me less tired, or prevent feeling tired? It doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence, which makes me question its effectiveness.

Looking at my personality: I strongly agree that I do a thorough job and am original with new ideas. But I'm also sometimes rude to others (strongly agree) and tend to be careless (agree). This mix might make me approach the ad critically but not necessarily dismissive of the product's potential benefits.

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and dull looks, which could appeal to someone looking for a quick fix. But it lacks details, like what's in the drink or how it works. My personality traits that lean towards being thorough make me skeptical because I want more information before trusting the claim fully.

On the other hand, my agreeable side makes me consider the possibility that this drink could be helpful. However, since I'm also somewhat trusting (disagree), I might not immediately believe the ad without more evidence or personal experience.

So, for attitude towards the ad: I don't dislike it, but it's neutral to me because it doesn't speak directly to my needs with sufficient detail. It's interesting in a way that it addresses common concerns, but I'm not sure if it's good enough to influence my purchase decision. The attractiveness is low because it's too generic.

Regarding purchase intention: I don't have a strong intent to buy based solely on this ad. While the idea of feeling less tired is appealing, without more information or a personal need for such a product, I'm not convinced. However, considering might happen if I come across more about the drink elsewhere.
