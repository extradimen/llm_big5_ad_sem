Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's think about my background. I'm from China, male, under 20, high school educated, a civil servant, divorced, and earn over 46 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so maybe the price of the drink isn't a big issue for me. But being a civil servant, maybe there are certain regulations about accepting gifts or promotions? Not sure if that affects my perception, but probably not directly.

Now, looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree. So I like to communicate and engage with others.
- Outgoing, Sociable: Neutral. Not super into socializing but not a loner either.
- Reserved: Strongly Agree. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe I'm talkative in certain settings but reserved in others?
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree. So community-oriented, maybe value products that benefit others.
- Generally trusting: Disagree. So I might be skeptical of ads.
- Sometimes rude: Neutral. Not a big issue.
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree. So detailed and careful in my approach.
- Make plans and follow through: Agree. Planner type.
- Tend to be careless: Agree. Maybe sometimes forgetful or not detail-oriented always.
- Get nervous easily: Agree. Stress can affect me.
- Worry a lot: Neutral. Not overly anxious but sometimes concerned.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree. So I might have mood swings or be more emotional.
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree. Creative thinker.
- Original, new ideas: Disagree. Maybe not the most innovative in ideas.
- Few artistic interests: Agree. More into practical things than arts.

Now, evaluating the ad: The drink is positioned to help stay energized and look good daily. For someone like me, being a civil servant, maybe looking good is important for work appearances? But I'm reserved, so perhaps not overly concerned about appearance. However, staying energized could be appealing since my job might require attention to detail and thoroughness.

But considering I'm skeptical (Disagree on trusting), the ad's claims might seem too good to be true. Also, the product is a drink—something that's consumed daily. My income allows me to afford it, but I'm more into being helpful and unselfish, so maybe I'd prefer products with community benefits rather than just personal gain.

I'm talkative and have an active imagination, which might make me consider creative aspects of the product, like how it's marketed or its unique features. But being original in ideas is a Disagree, so perhaps I don't see the drink as innovative.

Looking at purchase intention: Do I intend to buy this? Maybe not strongly because of skepticism and maybe not seeing enough value beyond personal energy and appearance. Trying it might be possible if there's a trial offer, but considering buying it would depend on further information or convincing evidence.

So for ad attitude, I'm neutral—maybe 3s across the board since I don't dislike it but don't find it compelling either. For purchase intention, maybe low scores as I'm not convinced enough to buy.
