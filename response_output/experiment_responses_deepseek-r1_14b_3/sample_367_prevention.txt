Okay, I'm a 40-49 year old single woman from China with a high school education and an income between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND. I'm talkative and reserved, outgoing but neutral, helpful and unselfish, but I strongly disagree that I'm trusting. Sometimes I'm rude, thorough in my work, make plans and follow through, but tend to be careless and get nervous easily. I worry a lot sometimes, am not very emotionally stable, have an active imagination, original with new ideas, and few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, evaluating my attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like it? The message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. As someone who's talkative and active but sometimes careless and nervous, maybe I don't connect much with feeling tired easily. But the ad targets feelings of looking dull, which might affect self-esteem. However, the phrasing is a bit negative. Since I'm somewhat reserved and value being original, I might not find it very appealing. So, perhaps 3 on a scale of 1-7.

2. Is it interesting? The idea is to link the drink with energy and appearance. It's a common theme but maybe not unique enough. Since my imagination is active and I'm original, I might not find this particularly engaging. Maybe around 4 or 5.

3. Do I believe the ad? Trust issues come in; I strongly disagree that I'm trusting. The ad's claim seems vague without evidence. So, lower on belief—maybe a 4.

4. Is it attractive? Ads with clear benefits can be appealing, but this one feels a bit overused. Since my imagination is active, maybe the visuals matter more than the message. Not sure if I find it attractive; perhaps a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? The ad targets feeling tired and looking dull. If I'm someone who sometimes worries a lot and gets nervous, maybe I'd consider products for energy, but I tend to be careless with purchases. Also, the price might matter—my income is decent but not sure if I want to spend on this. Maybe 5.

2. Will I try to buy it? Without strong belief in the product's effectiveness, trying it might be low. Maybe a 4 or 5.

3. Will I consider buying? It's possible, as it addresses concerns I might have about energy and appearance. So maybe around 6.
