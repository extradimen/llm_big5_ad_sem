Alright, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting people who might be concerned about their energy levels and appearance. Since I'm a civil servant in China with a postgraduate degree, I probably have a busy schedule and maybe some social interactions where looking presentable is important.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm reserved (Agree), which might make me less likely to be swayed by ads that emphasize socializing or being outgoing. But the ad isn't about socializing; it's more about personal energy and appearance, so maybe that's still relevant.

I'm generally trusting (Strongly Agree). That could make me more open to believing the claims of the ad. If I trust the message, I might be more inclined to consider the product.

However, I strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish with others. This doesn't directly relate to the ad, but maybe it affects how I perceive products aimed at social benefits. But again, this drink is about personal use, so perhaps not a big factor here.

I worry a lot (Disagree) and get nervous easily (Disagree). Since stress isn't a major issue for me, the ad's message might not hit close to home in terms of emotional appeal. It doesn't play into anxiety or fear of tiredness as much.

My active imagination (Strongly Agree) could make me more creative in how I perceive the product. Maybe I can picture myself using it and feeling more energetic, but without specific details, that's a stretch.

I'm original but disagree with coming up with new ideas, so perhaps I'm not drawn to ads that emphasize innovation. But this ad is more about necessity than innovation.

Now, considering my income is less than 15 million VND monthly. That's on the lower side for a civil servant in China, especially at a postgraduate level. So price sensitivity might be a factor. If the drink is expensive, I might not consider it, even if the ad resonates.

Thinking about purchase intention: Would I intend to buy this product? It depends on how much I believe the claims and my budget. Since I'm trusting but also reserved, maybe I'm open to trying it once, but wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately.

So for attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: Neutral might be 4.
2. Interesting: The message is clear, so maybe 5.
3. Good: It's truthful in its claims, so 6.
4. Attractive: Not particularly engaging, maybe 4.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Maybe 3, unsure.
2. Try to buy: Perhaps 4, leaning towards trying once.
3. Consider buying: Definitely a 5 as I'm thinking about it.

I think these scores reflect my cautious trust and consideration without strong emotional appeal.
