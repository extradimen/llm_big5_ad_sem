Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're a middle-aged Chinese man, a civil servant with a decent income but no college education. He's divorced, which might affect his lifestyle choices and social interactions. His personality traits include being talkative (strongly agrees), outgoing is a disagree, so maybe he's not the most sociable. Reserved is another disagree, so he's probably more of an extrovert in some ways but not too much. Neutral on helpfulness, so sometimes helpful but not always. Trusting is neutral too. He doesn't think he's rude, which is good. Thorough job? Neutral. Planning and following through, strongly agrees—so he's organized. Careless, strongly agrees—that's a bit conflicting with being thorough. Not nervous or worried much, so he's pretty laid back. Emotionally stable? Disagree, so maybe some ups and downs. Not original, doesn't have an active imagination—strongly disagrees on those points, which means he probably isn't into creative stuff much. And has few artistic interests, strongly agrees.

Now, the ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So targeting someone who's looking for energy and possibly appearance improvements.

For attitude toward the ad: Let's see. He's talkative but not overly outgoing or reserved. Not very helpful or trusting, so maybe he's cautious. He doesn't think he's rude, which is good. Being organized but careless might mean he likes efficiency but could be forgetful. Doesn't get nervous or worry much—so he's calm. Emotionally stable? Disagree, so maybe some instability.

So the ad needs to appeal to someone who values energy and appearance. Since he's a civil servant, maybe his job requires stamina. But given his income level, it's in the mid-range; not too high but comfortable. He might be looking for something that can help him perform better at work or maintain a good image.

Looking at the personality traits: His being strongly agree on making plans and following through suggests he values structure and consistency, so an ad that emphasizes daily routine could resonate with him. However, being careless (strongly agree) might make him less likely to stick to a product unless it's very convenient or necessary.

The ad's message is about staying energized and looking good every day. It's positive but maybe not tailored specifically to his more introverted or cautious nature. His artistic interests are low, so the ad should avoid being too flashy or creative in its approach.

His emotional stability is a disagreement point, meaning he might have fluctuating moods but isn't overly anxious. So an ad that doesn't create stress but offers a solution could be appealing.

Now, for his attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: Considering his talkative nature, maybe he likes it if it's engaging but not too over-the-top. However, being reserved and not very outgoing might make him less likely to 'like' an ad that's too energetic or social.
2. Interesting: If the ad is about energy and looking good, which are relevant to daily life, he might find it interesting, especially since he values planning and structure.
3. Good: The quality of the ad—does it present the product effectively? Since he's not very trusting and has neutral helpfulness, the ad needs to be credible without being too pushy.
4. Attractive: If the visuals are appealing but not overly artistic or flashy, maybe he finds it attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He might not intend to buy unless the product's benefits align closely with his needs and the ad effectively communicates those benefits.
2. Try to buy: Since he's organized but careless, maybe he would try it if prompted by a clear message.
3. Consider buying: Given that he makes plans and follows through, considering purchasing is likely, especially if the ad speaks to his desire for daily energy.

Putting this together, he might have neutral or slightly positive feelings towards the ad but may not be strongly moved to purchase unless convinced of its benefits.
