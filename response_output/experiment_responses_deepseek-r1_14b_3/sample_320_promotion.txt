Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at their demographic profile: they're a Chinese woman in her 30s-40s with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker and earning about 16 million VND to 25 million VND monthly. She's single. Her personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, trusting but sometimes careful, not rude, thorough in disagreeing, very agreeable on making plans and following through, not careless or nervous, worries a lot, emotionally unstable, not original with ideas, and has few artistic interests.

The ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

So, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - She might be interested in staying energized, especially as an office worker. The part about looking good could appeal to her, but given she doesn't have strong artistic interests or originality, maybe it's not a huge draw. But since she's outgoing and helpful, perhaps she likes ads that promote positive outcomes.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Given she has an active imagination and some creativity (though she disagrees on being original), the ad might be interesting enough because it combines energy with looking good, which are relevant daily concerns.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - She tends to worry a lot and values trustworthiness. The ad's message seems positive, but she might question if the drink truly delivers both benefits without more evidence.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Being outgoing and helpful, an ad that positions the product as something beneficial for others (maybe sharing with colleagues) could be appealing.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - While she's concerned about looking good and staying energized, her strong agreement on worrying a lot might make her cautious. She's thorough in disagreeing, so maybe she doesn't feel compelled to buy immediately without more info.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Given her tendency to follow through on plans, if the ad makes her consider it, she might try buying it once or twice.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - She worries a lot and is cautious, so even if interested, she's likely to weigh options before deciding.
