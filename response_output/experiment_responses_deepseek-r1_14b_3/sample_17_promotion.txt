Alright, let me break down how I came up with these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **Like the ad (score 3):** The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive attributes. However, as a reserved and careful person, I might not feel an immediate connection or strong emotion towards this ad. It's neutral to me.

2. **Interesting (score 4):** The message is clear about benefits, but it doesn't capture my imagination much. Since I'm not very creative, the straightforwardness doesn't make it particularly interesting.

3. **Believe the ad (score 5):** The claims are reasonableâ€”helps stay energized and look good. These are common product promises that seem believable without any strong evidence to doubt them.

4. **Attractive (score 4):** While the message is positive, I don't find it visually or conceptually compelling enough to be strongly attracted to it.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy (score 3):** The ad makes me consider the product, but I'm not convinced enough to have a strong intent. My cautious nature makes me wait for more information or perhaps try it first.

2. **Try to buy (score 5):** If I come across the product in store, the benefits mentioned might make me decide to try it. It's a positive step without high commitment.

3. **Consider buying (score 6):** The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, so I'm leaning towards considering it as a possible purchase, but not fully decided yet.
