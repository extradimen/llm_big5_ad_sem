Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 50-59 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree who is currently a student. My monthly income is less than 15,000 VND, which I think is pretty low, so cost might be a big factor for me. 

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let's break this down.

First, being a student with a postgraduate degree, I probably have a busy schedule. Staying energized sounds important because of the academic demands. However, my monthly income is quite low, so even though the drink might be helpful, its price could be a barrier. The ad doesn't mention anything about affordability, which makes me question if it's within my budget.

Looking at the personality traits: I'm talkative but not outgoing. So maybe I don't often share such products with others, but being talkative might mean I discuss things in smaller circles. I'm helpful and unselfish, so if this drink works well, I might want to help others by sharing it, but again, cost is a concern.

I tend to be careless, which sometimes could affect my purchasing decisions without much thought. But since I get nervous easily and worry a lot, maybe I'm more cautious with spending. The ad doesn't provide any evidence or proof of its benefits, so that makes me skeptical.

The drink's promise to "look your best" might appeal to me if I care about my appearance, but without knowing how it works or seeing any results, it's hard to believe. My personality leans towards being reserved and sometimes rude, which means I might not be easily swayed by such ads unless they're backed by something concrete.

Considering all this, the ad doesn't address affordability, lacks evidence, and relies on vague claims. So my attitude toward the ad is probably neutral or slightly negative. As for purchase intention, without trust in the product's effectiveness and considering my budget, I wouldn't be inclined to buy it.
