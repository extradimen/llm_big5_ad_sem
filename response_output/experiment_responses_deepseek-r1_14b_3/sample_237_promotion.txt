Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement claims the drink helps stay energized and look best daily. Given my personality traits, especially being reserved and not very outgoing or talkative, I don't see a strong connection to something that emphasizes energy and appearance. So, liking it (1) makes sense because it doesn't align with my personal values or lifestyle.

Finding it interesting (2): Since the ad targets energy and appearance, which aren't top priorities for me, I'm not particularly interested in it. Thus, a 2 feels right.

Believing it's good (3): The product claims are there, but without strong emotional appeal or personal relevance, my belief in its effectiveness is neutral to slightly negative, hence a 3.

Finding it attractive (4): Again, the message doesn't resonate with me much, so I don't find it visually or conceptually appealing enough to score higher than a 2.

Moving on to purchase intention: My monthly income is quite high, but my spending habits might be more conservative. Also, as a civil servant, I might prefer products that are practical and have proven benefits rather than something based heavily on appearance. Therefore, intending to buy (5) isn't likely; maybe a 3.

Trying the product (6): Since it's about energy, which I don't prioritize, I'm not inclined to try it, so another 3.

Considering buying (7): Without a strong reason or interest, considering it is low, hence a 4. 

Overall, my scores reflect that the ad doesn't speak to me personally and thus has minimal impact on my purchasing decisions.
