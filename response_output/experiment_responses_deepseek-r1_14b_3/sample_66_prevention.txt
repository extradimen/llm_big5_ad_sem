Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." I need to assess my attitude towards this ad and my purchase intentions using a 7-point scale. 

First, let's break down my demographics. I'm from China, female, under 20, have a bachelor’s degree, work as an office worker, single, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing (strongly agree), not helpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), sometimes rude (strongly disagree), careless (strongly agree), making plans and following through (strongly agree), among others.

Now, looking at the ad: it's targeting people who might feel tired and look dull without this drink. It seems to focus on energy and appearance. 

Starting with attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad. Hmm, the message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm outgoing and care about my appearance (from being single and in an office job), maybe this ad would appeal to me. But I'm also strongly disagreeing with being helpful and unselfish, so maybe the self-improvement angle doesn't hit as hard? Not sure yet.

2. Interesting. The concept is straightforward—drink gives energy and improves appearance. It's a common theme but might not be very original. However, since I'm into new ideas (strongly agree), perhaps it's not that interesting if it's too generic.

3. Good ad. To evaluate this, the ad should effectively communicate its message. The statement is direct but maybe lacks emotional depth or creativity. Since I have an active imagination (strongly disagree) and originality (strongly agree), a more unique angle might be better.

4. Attractive. Visual appeal matters. If the ad has appealing visuals of people looking vibrant, it could attract me. But if the visuals are generic, maybe not as attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Since I'm under 20 and an office worker, my income is low, so cost might be a barrier. Plus, being careless (strongly agree) might make me less likely to prioritize this product unless it's essential.

2. Try to buy: If the ad makes me curious enough, I might consider trying it, but given my tendency to worry a lot (agree), maybe I'm cautious about new products.

3. Consider buying: The ad targets concerns I have about energy and appearance, so I might think about it. However, without seeing evidence or having tried it, consideration is possible but not certain.

I need to assign scores from 1-7 for each of these. For the attitude towards the ad:

1. Like: Maybe around a 5. The message is relevant but perhaps not overly appealing given my traits.
2. Interesting: Maybe a 4. It's straightforward but lacks originality.
3. Good: A 5, as it effectively communicates but isn't outstanding in creativity.
4. Attractive: A 6 if the visuals are good; otherwise lower.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: 3—low intent due to cost and skepticism.
2. Try to buy: 4—curiosity might lead me to try it.
3. Consider buying: 5—I'm thinking about it but not sure.

Wait, but the initial response was [6,5,6,5] for ad attitude and [3,4,5] for purchase. I think that aligns because being outgoing makes the ad more attractive, and considering my job and age, the message resonates enough to be interesting. But cost is a barrier for intent.

I need to ensure each score reflects how much I agree or disagree with each statement based on my traits. Being strongly agree on originality but the ad isn't original, so maybe lower scores there.

In summary:

Ad attitude: Like (6), Interesting (5), Good (5), Attractive (6). Purchase intention: Intend (3), Try (4), Consider (5).
