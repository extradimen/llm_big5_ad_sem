Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: it's trying to sell a drink that prevents tiredness and dull looks. Given my background as a student in China with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND, this seems within my purchasing range.

I'm reserved (strongly agree), so ads that are too flashy or outgoing might not appeal to me. The ad's message is clear but doesn't seem to engage my emotions much. I don't feel connected to it because it doesn't highlight any unique features or benefits beyond the obvious tiredness and looking dull, which I'm somewhat aware of but not extremely concerned about.

Considering my personality traits: I'm talkative (agree), but that doesn't mean I like all ads. Being outgoing is a disagree trait for me, so I might find the ad too pushy or not tailored to someone more introverted. Also, since I'm strongly reserved, I might not be drawn to an ad that's overly enthusiastic.

I tend to worry a lot (agree) and get nervous easily (strongly agree), which makes me sensitive to stress-related messages. However, the ad doesn't offer any specific solution beyond the drink, so it feels a bit vague. My skepticism towards ads (strongly disagree on trusting) makes me question the product's effectiveness without more evidence.

Looking at purchase intentions: I don't have a strong intent because the ad doesn't create an urgent need or provide enough reason to choose this product over others. Plus, my tendency to be careful with purchases might make me wait for more information or try samples before buying.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat relevant and good (scores 3 and 4), it doesn't strongly connect with me as a reserved, cautious individual, leading to lower scores on likability and interest. My purchase intentions are low because I'm not convinced enough by the ad alone.
