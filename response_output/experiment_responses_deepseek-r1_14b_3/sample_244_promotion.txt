Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down my thoughts step by step.

First, looking at the demographic profile: I'm a male over 60 from China with a postgraduate degree but currently a student. My income is less than 15 million VND monthly, which is about $670 USD. That's relatively low for someone in China, especially considering my age and education. 

Now, the personality traits: I'm outgoing but reserved. I disagree that I'm talkative, so maybe I'm more of an introvert or prefer smaller groups. But being outgoing might mean I engage in social activities. However, I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish? Wait, no, actually, I strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish. That's a key point because it affects how I perceive the ad.

The ad is about a drink that keeps you energized and helps look your best. So, the benefits are energy and appearance. For someone over 60, staying energized could be appealing, but looking good might not be as high a priority as for younger people. But considering my outgoing nature, maybe I do care about looking presentable.

I'm also somewhat trusting (neutral), so I don't have strong feelings about trusting the brand. However, being original and having an active imagination is something I strongly agree with. Maybe that makes me more open to new ideas or creative ads, but the ad seems pretty straightforward.

On the negative side, I find it hard to be helpful and unselfish (strongly disagree). So, maybe the ad's message about helping you look your best doesn't resonate if I don't prioritize looking good. Also, my income is low, so price might be a barrier. The ad doesn't mention cost, which could make me hesitant.

Purchase intention-wise, I'm neutral on intending to buy, but considering trying it if reminded. However, my monthly income is low, and if the drink is expensive, that might lower my consideration score.

Let me think about each question:

1. Like the ad: The message isn't really tailored to someone like me who's more reserved and doesn't prioritize looking good as much as others. So maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's not particularly interesting because it targets energy and appearance, which may not be top priorities for me. Maybe a 4.
3. Good: The ad is clear but lacks emotional appeal for me. A 5?
4. Attractive: Since I'm reserved and the ad is energetic, maybe a 6, but not too high.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Probably neutral, so 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe slightly higher than intent because it's an option if available, so 4.
3. Consider buying: If I think about it, maybe 5, but price is a concern.

Wait, I might have overcomplicated this. Let me try again:

Ad attitude: Since the ad focuses on energy and looking good, which are somewhat relevant but not top priorities for me, especially considering my personality traits like being unhelpful with others. Maybe I don't connect emotionally. So perhaps lower scores.

Purchase intention: Considering the benefits, it's possible, but without knowing the price, I'm uncertain. Maybe 3s and 4s.
