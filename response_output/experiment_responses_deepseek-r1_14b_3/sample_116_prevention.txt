Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their background and personality. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad is about a drink that prevents tiredness and looking dull. The target demographic is a 40–49-year-old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree, married, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. He’s talkative, outgoing, helpful, thorough in his work, not trusting, sometimes rude, not careless, not nervous, not a worrier, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, and is original but not very into arts.

So, the ad's main message is about avoiding negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull) without necessarily highlighting benefits. This sounds like a prevention-focused ad because it's about preventing something bad from happening rather than promoting gains.

Now, evaluating his attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
He’s talkative and outgoing, which might make him appreciate ads that are engaging. But since he’s not very trusting, maybe the ad doesn’t feel credible enough for him to like it much. So a 3 seems fair.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
Given his active imagination and originality, the concept could be interesting. But if the execution isn't creative, he might not find it that engaging. Maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
Trust issues here—since he strongly disagrees with being generally trusting, he might doubt the ad's effectiveness. A 3 seems right.

4. I find the ad attractive.
Attractive could relate to how well it’s made visually and conceptually. If it's not very creative or if he doesn’t see himself in it, maybe a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
Prevention-focused ads might appeal to someone thorough like him, but without seeing the ad itself, his intent is low. Maybe a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Tends towards agreement here because he's methodical, so if convinced, he'll try it once. Maybe a 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
Considering it shows he’s thinking about it, but without strong belief in the ad, maybe a 5 is okay.

Wait, does being helpful and unselfish make him more likely to buy? Not necessarily; he might think it's good for others but not himself unless convinced.

Also, his income is <15 million VND, which is about $600-700 USD. He's a married office worker, so maybe more cautious with spending, which would affect purchase intent.

So overall, the scores reflect a somewhat neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the ad but not enough to strongly intend buying.
