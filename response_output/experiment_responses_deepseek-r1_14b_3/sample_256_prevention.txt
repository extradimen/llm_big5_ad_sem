Alright, let's break this down. I'm a male over 60 from China with a postgraduate degree and work in an office. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which is about $700 or so. That's on the lower side for someone with my education, but maybe common in some regions.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who might be feeling fatigued and concerned about their appearance.

My personality traits: I'm talkative (Agree), which means I enjoy conversations. Outgoing? Disagree, so I'm not very social. Reserved? Strongly disagree—so maybe that's conflicting? Wait, if I'm not reserved, does that mean I'm more open? Hmm, perhaps. But my outgoing is a disagreement, so I'm somewhere in the middle.

I'm helpful and unselfish: Neutral. So sometimes yes, sometimes no. Trusting? Disagree, so I tend to be cautious. Sometimes rude? Strongly Agree—that's a red flag. Thorough job? Strongly Agree—so detail-oriented. Plans and follow through? Strongly Disagree—bad at planning. Careless? Neutral. Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree. Worry a lot: Strongly Agree. Emotionally stable? No way, strongly disagree. Active imagination: Disagree. Original ideas? Strongly Disagree. Artistic interests: Disagree.

So the ad is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. I'm an office worker, so maybe dealing with long hours, which can cause fatigue. The drink could be marketed as an energy booster or something to help stay alert.

But wait, my income is low. That might affect my purchasing power. Maybe I wouldn't spend on such a product unless it's necessary. Plus, being over 60, health is a concern, but maybe I'm more cautious about what I consume.

The ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's a negative appeal—scare tactics to make you feel bad without the product. Since I get nervous easily and worry a lot, this could play into my emotions. But I'm not very trusting of ads, so I might be skeptical.

I'm detail-oriented (Strongly Agree) but poor at making plans (Strongly Disagree). So maybe I'm someone who values thoroughness in products but isn't great at following through on purchases? Not sure how that ties in.

Also, being talkative and somewhat outgoing, the ad's message might resonate with me if it affects my social interactions. If I feel tired, perhaps I don't perform well socially or at work, which could be a concern.

But considering my income is low, would I prioritize such a product? Maybe not unless it's essential. Plus, health-related products require trust, and since I'm disagree on trusting others, that might lower my confidence in the ad.

The ad seems to target emotional triggers—worry about looking dull and feeling tired, which aligns with my tendency to worry a lot. But given that I'm not very trusting, the effectiveness might be limited. Also, being original and creative is not my strong suit, so maybe the ad's message isn't appealing on an imaginative level.

In terms of purchase intention: I'm detail-oriented, so thoroughness in product quality could matter, but without trust, it's a barrier. Plus, low income might make me hesitant to spend unless proven necessary.

So for attitude toward the ad: Maybe neutral to slightly negative because while it taps into worries, I'm skeptical and not very outgoing or trusting. For purchase intention, maybe low because of cost and skepticism, despite the thoroughness in the product's claims.
