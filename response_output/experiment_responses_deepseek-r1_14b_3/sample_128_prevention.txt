Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, the key message is that not having this drink could lead to feeling tired and looking unattractive. It seems like a prevention-focused ad, targeting people who want to avoid negative outcomes.

Now, considering her demographic profile: she's from China, female, under 20, postgraduate student, divorced, with a monthly income between 36 million and 45 million VND. That's quite a high income for a student, which might mean she can afford luxury or premium products. Being a postgrad, she's probably busy with studies, so maybe this drink is marketed as an energy booster or something to help her stay alert.

Looking at her personality traits:

1. Talkative: Disagree – She's not the type to engage in a lot of conversation.
2. Outgoing, sociable: Agree – So she does enjoy being around people and social events.
3. Reserved: Neutral – Doesn't strongly agree or disagree, so maybe she's sometimes reserved but not always.
4. Helpful and unselfish: Neutral – She might help when needed but isn't overly so.
5. Generally trusting: Disagree – Trust is an issue for her.
6. Sometimes rude to others: Strongly Agree – This could affect how people perceive her, especially in social settings.
7. Thorough job: Strongly Disagree – She doesn't do things thoroughly, which might impact her views on products that require attention to detail or quality.
8. Makes plans and follows through: Disagree – So she's not very reliable with commitments.
9. Careless: Strongly Agree – This is a big trait; she tends to be careless in her actions or decisions.
10. Gets nervous easily: Disagree – She doesn't get nervous much, but that could also mean she's more laid-back.
11. Worries a lot: Strongly Agree – High anxiety or tendency to overthink things.
12. Emotionally stable: Neutral – Doesn't lean heavily one way or the other.
13. Active imagination: Agree – She's creative and imaginative.
14. Original, comes up with new ideas: Strongly Agree – She's innovative.
15. Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree – She has a strong interest in arts.

Now, evaluating the ad:

The ad is prevention-focused because it warns about negative outcomes (feeling tired and looking dull) if you don't use the product. This might resonate with her if she's concerned about her appearance or energy levels, especially since she's outgoing and social. However, considering she's careless and sometimes rude, maybe she doesn't prioritize such concerns highly.

Her personality traits like being outgoing (Agree), having an active imagination (Agree), and original ideas (Strongly Agree) might make the ad more interesting to her because it plays into her desire for innovation or standing out. However, she worries a lot (Strongly Agree) which could mean she's concerned about looking dull in social settings, making the ad more relevant.

But she strongly disagrees with being thorough and follows through on plans. This might make her less likely to pay attention to details in ads or trust them fully. She's also not very trusting of people, so the credibility of the ad is questionable for her.

Regarding purchase intention: Her income is high, but as a student, she might be cautious with spending. However, if the product is positioned as something that helps her maintain energy and social image, which are important given her outgoing nature, she might consider it. But since she's careless (Strongly Agree) and sometimes doesn't follow through on plans (Disagree), she might not prioritize buying this drink.

So, scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: She might not strongly like it because of the lack of trust and being careless.
2. Interesting: Her active imagination could find it interesting.
3. Good: The message is clear but her distrust affects how good she thinks it is.
4. Attractive: The idea of looking dull might be a concern, making it attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: She might not have a strong intent due to carelessness and lack of thoroughness.
2. Try: Maybe if she feels the need, but her tendency to be careless could prevent her from trying it.
3. Consider: Given her outgoing nature and concerns about appearance, she might consider buying it.

But I'm not entirely sure about some points, especially how her personality interacts with the ad's message. Maybe she's more likely to be swayed by the social aspects but less so by the necessity due to being careless.
