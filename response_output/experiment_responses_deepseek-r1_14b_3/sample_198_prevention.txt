Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my scores for this advertisement.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**  
   The ad focuses on preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. While it's a common approach to highlight negative outcomes of not using the product, I'm neutral because the message is direct but lacks emotional appeal or creativity. It doesn't resonate strongly with me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**  
   The concept is straightforward—emphasizing the consequences of not drinking it—but it's not particularly engaging or innovative. So, I'm neutral on its interest factor.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**  
   The ad effectively communicates a clear benefit, which is preventing tiredness and looking dull. It's functional but doesn't go beyond that, so I agree it's good without being exceptional.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**  
   The message is clear, but it lacks visual or emotional elements to make it truly attractive. Without more creativity, I'm neutral on its attractiveness.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 4)**  
   The ad's message aligns with a desire to feel energetic and look good, which are important to me. However, without seeing the product or knowing more details, my intent is moderate.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**  
   While I'm interested in the benefits, I wouldn't rush to buy it without more information or personal experience. So, a middle score here.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 5)**  
   The ad makes me think about whether the drink could meet my needs for energy and appearance. It's enough to make me consider it, so I agree more strongly here.
