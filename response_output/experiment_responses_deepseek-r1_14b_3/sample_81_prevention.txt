Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: it suggests that without this drink, one might feel tired and look dull. Considering my personality traits, I'm generally trusting (Strongly Agree) which makes me more open to believing such claims. However, I tend to worry a lot? No, actually, I strongly disagree with worrying a lot, so maybe that's why the ad doesn't hit me as hard in terms of fear appeal.

For my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad**: The message seems straightforward and addresses potential concerns about tiredness and appearance, which are relatable. But I'm not overly enthusiastic, hence a 4.
   
2. **Interesting**: The concept is simple but effective, so it's somewhat interesting, scoring a 5.

3. **Good**: It conveys the product's benefits clearly, making it a decent ad, so a 6.

4. **Attractive**: While not unattractive, it doesn't stand out much, so I'll go with a 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: The ad makes me consider the drink, but I'm not fully convinced yet. So, a 3.
   
2. **Will try to buy**: If I come across it in a store, I might give it a shot, so another 4.

3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar now, so a 5 seems appropriate.

Overall, the ad is effective but doesn't create a strong emotional drive for me to purchase immediately.
