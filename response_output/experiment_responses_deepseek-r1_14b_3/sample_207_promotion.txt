Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: they're from China, over 60 years old, postgraduate education, and has a decent income of 36-45 million VND per month. He's divorced, which might mean he values independence or self-reliance more. His personality traits show he's talkative but reserved, helpful, not very trusting, sometimes rude, careless? No, he strongly disagrees with being careless and tends to worry a lot.

Now, looking at the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance, which are both health and vanity concerns. Since he's over 60, maybe he's concerned about staying active and looking good as he ages.

His personality traits: He's talkative but reserved, so perhaps he values social interactions but isn't the most outgoing. Being helpful and unselfish suggests he cares about others but might not be swayed by ads that emphasize social aspects too much. He worries a lot and gets nervous easily, which could make him cautious about new products or health claims.

He's also thorough in his approach but disagrees with being a thorough worker, so maybe he doesn't trust the ad's claims without evidence. He makes plans and follows through, which is good for purchase intention if he trusts the product.

His emotional stability is there, but he tends to worry a lot, so the ad needs to be trustworthy. He has few artistic interests and isn't original, so the ad should be straightforward rather than creative or too flashy.

Considering all this, I think the ad's message is clear but might not resonate strongly with him because of his cautious nature and high tendency to worry. He values trust and thoroughness, which the ad doesn't explicitly provide. Therefore, he might not find it extremely likeable or interesting, scoring lower on those aspects.

For purchase intention: He's careful about purchases, so unless the product has strong evidence or a recommendation, he might not intend to buy immediately but could consider it if more information is available.
