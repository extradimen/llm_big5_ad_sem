Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, I considered the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. As someone who is reserved but helpful and unselfish, I might not feel the need to change my appearance or energy levels for others as much.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad. - 3: The message is clear, but it doesn't really speak to me since I'm more focused on internal traits than external appearances.
2. Interesting? Maybe a bit, but not overly so. So another 3.
3. Good? Not particularly impactful for me, so 3 again.
4. Attractive? It's straightforward but not visually or conceptually engaging, so 3.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Probably not, as I'm more about practical needs than appearance. So 2.
2. Try to buy? Possibly if others recommend it, so a slightly higher score, maybe 3.
3. Consider buying? Maybe in certain situations, so another 3.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate much with my personality and values.
