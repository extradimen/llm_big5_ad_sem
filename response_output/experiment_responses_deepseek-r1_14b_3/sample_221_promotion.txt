Alright, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let me break down how I think about it based on my background and personality traits.

First, looking at the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's pretty straightforward, targeting people who want energy and maybe some cosmetic benefits. Since I'm under 20 in China, this could be aimed at my demographic, but I'm not sure if it resonates with me personally.

Considering my personality traits: I find the ad neutral in terms of being talkative or outgoing, so those aspects don't really affect my view. However, since I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, maybe the idea of looking good and staying energized to be there for others is appealing. But wait, I also strongly disagree with having few artistic interests, so maybe I'm more into practical things rather than appearance.

I tend to worry a lot, which might make me think about whether this drink is necessary or if it's just another fad. My cautious nature could lead me to question the claims without evidence. Plus, I strongly disagree with being original or having an active imagination, so maybe the ad doesn't stand out enough for me.

Looking at my purchase intentions: I'm not someone who makes plans often and am somewhat careless, which might mean I don't prioritize buying this product unless it's necessary. My monthly income is low, so price could be a factor. Plus, being from China, local brands might hold more weight than an international one unless it's proven effective.

So, for the ad attitude scores: I'm neutral on liking it because it doesn't excite me much. Interesting? Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat engaging but not unique. Good? A 4 since it's okay but not great. Attractive? Also around 4 as it's decent but not visually striking.

For purchase intentions: Intend to buy is low, maybe a 2 because I'm unsure. Trying to buy might be a 3 as I might consider it if others recommend. Considering buying could be a 4 since it's possible if I see benefits or deals.
