Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and figure out my scores based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break this down step by step.

First, understanding my own profile: I'm a female from China, under 20, with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant, which is interesting because that's a stable job but might be quite busy. My income is over 46 million VND monthly, so I have a decent income for someone my age, possibly due to family support or a government salary.

Looking at personality traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree), outgoing and sociable (neutral), reserved (strongly disagree), helpful and unselfish (neutral), generally trusting (strongly disagree). So, I tend to be more of an extrovert but not extremely so. Not very trusting, which might affect how I perceive ads.

I'm sometimes rude (agree), thorough in my job? No, strongly disagree, which means I'm careless (agree) and not someone who makes plans or follows through (strongly disagree). Also, emotionally unstable (strongly disagree) but have an active imagination and original ideas (strongly agree).

Now, the ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's targeting a need to stay alert and presentable, perhaps aimed at professionals or busy individuals.

Considering my personality: I'm talkative and outgoing, so maybe this ad resonates with me in terms of social settings where looking good and being energetic matters. However, since I don't make thorough plans (strongly disagree), I might not rely on products that promise to enhance such aspects as a necessity. But given my income level, I can afford luxury items.

I'm not very trusting of ads, so the message's credibility is important. The ad suggests negative outcomes without the product—feeling tired and looking dull—which plays into fear of appearing less than optimal in social or professional settings.

My tendency to be careless (agree) might mean I don't prioritize such products highly unless they offer immediate benefits. But since it's a drink, perhaps something quick and easy to consume, that could appeal.

Emotionally, I'm not very stable, so ads that make me feel anxious about my appearance or energy levels might have an effect. The ad uses fear of negative outcomes, which can be persuasive for some but might also turn others off if they see it as manipulative.

I'm original and creative, so maybe the ad's message is seen as a bit generic, not very original. However, the idea of feeling tired without the drink is relatable to many, especially in a busy lifestyle.

So, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad: The message is clear, but given my distrust towards ads and the manipulative angle, I might not like it much. So maybe around 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme, so maybe neutral, around 4.
3. Good: Not particularly good as it's too generic, perhaps lower, say 3.
4. Attractive: The ad is straightforward but not visually appealing or creative enough, so maybe 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: I'm not convinced enough by the fear tactic; probably a 2.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if it's convenient, but likely neutral at 3.
3. Consider buying: Not really considering, maybe 4.

I need to balance my critical side with the fact that as a civil servant, maybe staying alert is important, and I can afford it. But my distrust in ads makes me cautious. My outgoing nature might make the social aspect more relevant, though.

So finalizing:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 4, 3, 3]
Purchase intention: [2, 3, 4]

I think these scores reflect a somewhat neutral to slightly negative view of the ad and low intent but not completely dismissing it.
