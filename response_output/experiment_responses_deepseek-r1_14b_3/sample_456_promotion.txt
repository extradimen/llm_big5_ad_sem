Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand their background. They're a Chinese male in his 40s with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's talkative, outgoing, helpful, but not very trusting, tends to get nervous easily, isn't emotionally stable, and doesn't have an active imagination or original ideas.

Now, the ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So, the key points are energy and looking good.

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - He's outgoing and helpful, which might make him more open to positive messages. But he doesn't have an active imagination or original ideas, so maybe the ad isn't that exciting for him. Also, being a bit reserved and not trusting could make him skeptical. So, probably neutral to slightly disagree.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Since he's not very imaginative or original, the ad might not capture his interest much. It's straightforward, so maybe neutral.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - He tends to get nervous and isn't trusting, which could make him doubt the claims. But the benefits are clearâ€”energy and looking good, which are relevant for daily life. So, maybe a bit higher than neutral but not strongly agree.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being outgoing, he might find it somewhat attractive because it's positive, but without strong emotional appeal, maybe around neutral to slightly disagree.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's not very trusting of ads and tends to be careless (disagree). Also, being on a budget, the price might matter. So, probably doesn't intend to buy.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Again, skepticism and budget constraints might make him hesitant. Maybe he won't go out of his way to try it unless convinced otherwise.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It's a health and energy drink, which could be useful. He might give it some consideration if the benefits align with his needs, so maybe neutral or slightly agree.

Putting all together, scores would likely be low for ad attitude but not too harsh, and purchase intentions also low.
