Alright, I need to evaluate how this advertisement would be received by someone with a specific demographic and personality profile. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, let's look at the demographic details:
- The person is from China, female, over 60 years old.
- She has a postgraduate degree but works as a blue-collar worker, which might mean she's in a physically demanding job.
- She's divorced and earns over 46 million VND monthly, so her income is quite high.

Now, her personality traits:
- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, Sociable: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Strongly Agree
- Helpful and Unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Agree
- Sometimes Rude: Agree
- Thorough Job: Neutral
- Makes Plans: Neutral
- Careless: Neutral
- Gets Nervous Easily: Agree
- Worries a Lot: Agree
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active Imagination: Disagree
- Original, New Ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic Interests: Agree

The advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Starting with the ad's attitude:
1. I like the ad.
   - Considering her reserved nature and tendency to worry a lot, she might not be too enthusiastic about ads that are too flashy or make big claims. She could find this one somewhat appealing but not overly so. Maybe around 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message focuses on energy and appearance, which are relevant for someone needing stamina due to a demanding job. It might catch her attention, so perhaps a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - She values trust but is cautious. The claims seem too general, so she might not fully trust it. Maybe a 3.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being reserved and possibly not outgoing, she might not find it very attractive. A 2 seems appropriate.

For purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - She's careful but has a high income, so maybe she's willing to try something that could boost her energy. But since the ad is generic, perhaps a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Similar to intent, she might consider it but isn't fully sold. Another 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Given her high income and need for energy, she's more likely to think about purchasing, so maybe a 4.

I should make sure the scores reflect her cautious nature and the ad's generic claims without specific evidence or personal connection.
