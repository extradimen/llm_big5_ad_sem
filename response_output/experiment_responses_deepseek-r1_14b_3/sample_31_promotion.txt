Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement for a drink that's supposed to help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the demographic profile of the person. They're from China, male, under 20, high school educated, a blue-collar worker, divorced, with a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. That's about $1,440 to $1,800 USD per month, which isn't too bad but considering living expenses in China, it might be tight for some.

Next, looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing: Neutral
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree
- Trusting: Neutral
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Makes plans and follows through: Disagree
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worries a lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So this person is talkative and helpful but not very outgoing or thorough. They get nervous and worry a lot, which might affect their decision-making. They're original with an active imagination but don't have much artistic interest.

Now, the advertisement claims the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. Let's see how this resonates with each aspect.

1. **Attitude toward the ad**: 
   - Like: The person is talkative and helpful, which might make them appreciate products that enhance social interactions or confidence. However, being nervous and worried could make them skeptical about such claims.
   - Interesting: Since they have an active imagination and are original, the idea of a drink that boosts energy and appearance might catch their interest.
   - Good: They agree to be helpful but are neutral on trust. The ad's credibility is key here. If it seems too good to be true, they might not find it trustworthy.
   - Attractive: The combination of looking best and staying energized could appeal, especially if the person is conscious about their appearance and social interactions.

2. **Purchase intention**:
   - Intend: High energy and better looks are appealing, but being cost-conscious (as a blue-collar worker with a moderate income), they might not immediately intend to buy.
   - Try: Maybe, if the ad seems trustworthy or if they're feeling tired or want to improve their appearance.
   - Consider: They could be on the fence, needing more information or seeing others use it before deciding.

Considering their tendency to get nervous and worry a lot, they might be cautious about health products. The ad's effectiveness depends on how much trust it can build. Their originality might make them curious but not easily convinced without evidence.

So for attitude scores, I'd rate like as 4, interesting as 5, good as 3, and attractive as 4. For purchase intention, intend is 2, try is 3, consider is 4.
