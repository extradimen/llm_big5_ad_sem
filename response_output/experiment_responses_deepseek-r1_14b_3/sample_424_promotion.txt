Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, they're targeting people who want energy and to look good.

Looking at my demographics, I'm a single female office worker from China under 20 with a bachelor's degree. My monthly income is between 16 million and 25 million VND, which is on the lower end but still decent for Vietnam. Now, considering my personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Strongly Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Agree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Get nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Agree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Artistic interests: Disagree

So, I'm reserved but helpful and trusting. I worry a lot, which might make me cautious about ads. Also, my active imagination could mean I'm more creative, maybe susceptible to vivid imagery in ads.

The ad's claims are about energy and looking good daily. As a student or office worker, staying energized is important. However, "look your best" is a broad statementâ€”does it mean better skin, style, or something else? It might appeal to my desire for self-improvement but could be vague.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is positive, but since I'm reserved and worry a lot, I might not feel strongly about it. Not enough personal relevance or emotional connection. Maybe a 3?
   
2. Interesting.
   - It's a common claim, so maybe not that interesting. But with an active imagination, perhaps the imagery could be engaging. A 4?

3. Good ad.
   - The claims are clear but might feel overused. Not sure if it's credible or stands out. Maybe a 5.

4. Attractive.
   - Visuals matter, but without knowing the specific execution, hard to say. If it's visually appealing, maybe a 6? Otherwise, lower.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - I'm cautious and worry a lot about products' effectiveness. Need more proof or a personal reason. Maybe a 4.

2. Try to buy.
   - Without strong intent but might consider if others recommend. A 5?

3. Consider buying.
   - It's on my radar, especially with the energetic aspect. Perhaps a higher score here, like 6?

Wait, but I tend to be reserved and sometimes rude, which might affect how I perceive ads. Maybe I'm more skeptical of overtly positive messages.

Let me adjust:

Ad attitude scores: [3,4,5,6]

Purchase intention: [4,5,6]
