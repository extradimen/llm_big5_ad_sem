Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as the person described. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down my thought process step by step.

First, considering my background: I'm a female over 60 living in China, with a high school education, currently a student, living with parents, and have a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing (Strongly Agree), reserved (Strongly Disagree), helpful (Agree), trusting (Disagree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), thorough (Agree), but not good at following through with plans (Disagree). I'm not careless, get nervous easily (Disagree), don't worry a lot (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), have an active imagination (Strongly Disagree), original and creative (Agree), but have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree).

Now, looking at the ad: It's trying to sell a drink by highlighting negative outcomes of not using it—feeling tired and looking dull. So, the message is about preventing tiredness and avoiding looking dull.

I need to evaluate this as someone who might be influenced by such an ad. Let's go through each part.

Attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

Starting with attitude. Do I like the ad? The message seems negative, focusing on what happens without the drink. Since I'm emotionally stable and don't worry a lot, maybe such fear-based marketing isn't as effective for me. Also, being helpful and unselfish, perhaps I prefer ads that emphasize positive benefits rather than negatives. So, I might not strongly like it—maybe around a 3.

Is it interesting? Negative messages can sometimes be attention-grabbing, but since the ad doesn't appeal to my imagination much (I have little artistic interest), maybe it's not very interesting to me. A 2 here.

Believe the ad is good: I'm somewhat doubtful because I tend to disagree with being trusting and don't find ads manipulative appealing. So, perhaps a 3 for believing it's good.

Attractive? Negative messages might not be as attractive to someone who is emotionally stable and prefers positive reinforcement. Maybe a 2 here.

For purchase intention: Intend to buy? Probably low because the ad doesn't resonate much with me; maybe a 1.

Will I try to buy? Even lower, so another 1.

Consider buying? Slightly higher than trying, but still not high—maybe a 2 or 3. Let's say 2.

So putting it all together:
Ad attitude scores: [3, 2, 3, 2]
Purchase intention: [1, 1, 2]

I think that makes sense because the ad doesn't align well with my personality traits and preferences.
