Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding my profile: I'm from China, female, under 20, have a bachelor's degree, work in blue-collar, divorced, and earn between 16â€“25 million VND monthly. My personality is such that I agree with being helpful, thorough, making plans, and having an active imagination but strongly disagree with trusting others and being sometimes rude.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad is positive, which might appeal to me since I'm helpful and have an active imagination. But the idea of a drink for energy isn't something I'd prioritize over other needs. Maybe not strong enough to like it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's a common claim, but the focus on both energy and appearance could resonate with someone looking to improve their daily routine. Maybe neutral.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - I'm thorough in my thinking, so without evidence or specific benefits, it might not be convincing. Neutral again.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The promise of looking good and feeling energized is appealing, but considering my income level, maybe not enough to make me think it's very attractive. Still neutral.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - I'm cautious about trusting ads, especially without clear evidence or personal experience. So probably disagree.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Since the ad targets energy and appearance, which might align with my desire for improvement but isn't a top priority. Disagree again.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's possible I'd think about it if others recommend or if there are promotions. Neutral.
