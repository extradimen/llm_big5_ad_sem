Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a 25-year-old office worker from China, married, with a monthly income of around 36-45 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Agree), not very helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), neutral on trusting others, sometimes rude? No, I strongly disagree with that. Thorough job? Disagree, plan and follow through? Strongly Agree, careless? Neutral, get nervous easily? Disagree, worry a lot? Strongly Disagree, emotionally stable? Neutral, active imagination? Strongly Disagree, original ideas? Disagree, few artistic interests? Agree.

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, my attitude towards the ad. Let's break down each point:

1. I like the ad. Hmm, the message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm outgoing and value appearing well, maybe it resonates a bit. But the wording seems a bit negative, focusing on what you don't have. Maybe not very appealing to me.

2. Interesting? The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, especially in a busy work environment. But the ad feels a bit generic. Not too interesting, but maybe 4/7?

3. Good? I think effectiveness matters here. Does this ad effectively communicate the product's benefits? It points out problems without providing solutions clearly. So, not particularly good. Maybe around 5.

4. Attractive? Visual appeal and creativity matter. The ad is straightforward but lacks a creative hook. Probably neutral on attractiveness, so maybe 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? I'm more persuaded by ads that offer clear benefits or show how the product improves my life. This one's too vague. Maybe 5/7.

2. Will try to buy? It's a consideration, but without strong motivation, I might not make an effort. So perhaps 4.

3. Consider buying? It does plant a seed. I might think about it if I see more ads or have a need. Maybe 6/7.
