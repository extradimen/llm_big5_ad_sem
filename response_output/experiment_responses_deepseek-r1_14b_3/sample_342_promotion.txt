Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 30-39-year-old single female from China with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, earning between 36 million and 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits are outgoing, helpful, trusting, but sometimes rude, careless, and original.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Since I'm a busy blue-collar worker, staying energized is important to me. The ad's message aligns with my need for productivity and looking good. My outgoing nature might make me want to present well socially, which this product supports.

Looking at the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - I agree because it highlights energy and appearance, which are important to me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Neutral, since the message is clear but not particularly engaging or unique.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Disagree; the ad feels generic and lacks specific benefits that would make me trust it more.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Strongly agree because the visuals and message appeal to my desire for vitality.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Neutral, as I'm not convinced by the ad alone but might consider it with more info.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Disagree; without seeing evidence or knowing where to find it, I won't make an effort.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Strongly agree because the benefits align with my needs, so I would think about it.

Scores: [4, 3, 2, 5] for attitude and [3, 2, 6] for purchase intention.
