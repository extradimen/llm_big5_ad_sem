Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that's claiming if you don't have it, you'll feel tired and look dull. Let me break down how I would approach this as someone with the given demographic and personality traits.

First, looking at my personality, I'm helpful, trusting, and make plans but am also prone to being careless and getting nervous easily. My income is pretty high for a postgraduate in Vietnam, which might mean I have more disposable income, but maybe I'm cautious about spending.

The ad's message focuses on the negative outcomes of not using the product: feeling tired and looking dull. This is a common tactic in ads to create fear or anxiety. Since I tend to get nervous easily and worry a lot (though I disagree with worrying), this might play into my emotions. However, I'm also someone who sometimes worries but doesn't agree strongly with it.

I'm outgoing but neutral on being talkative and reserved. So, the ad's message about looking dull could resonate if I care about my appearance and social interactions. But since I don't have a strong imagination or come up with new ideas, maybe this ad isn't as engaging to me in terms of creativity.

In terms of purchase intention, even though the ad might make me think about the product because it addresses feeling tired (which could relate to being thorough or making plans), my tendency to be careless and not worry a lot might make me less likely to take immediate action. Plus, I'm living with parents, which might mean I have some financial constraints despite a high income.

So for attitude towards the ad: It's somewhat interesting because it addresses real feelings but maybe feels a bit manipulative since it's using negative emotions. The message is clear and good in that sense, but not overly attractive to me as someone who isn't highly influenced by such tactics.

For purchase intention: I might consider buying it because the product seems useful, especially if tiredness is a concern. But I'm not immediately driven to try or intend to buy it right away; maybe more of a consideration.
