Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this ad. First, understanding my own profile is key. I'm a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree and a high income. My personality traits show I'm reserved, helpful, trusting, and not talkative or outgoing.

The advertisement focuses on preventing tiredness and dull looks without the drink. Given my age and background, health and vitality are probably important to me. The ad's message is straightforward but maybe too simplistic for someone with a higher educationâ€”though it might still resonate because it addresses real concerns about aging and appearance.

Looking at the ad type, it seems preventive rather than promotional since it highlights avoiding negative outcomes. Now, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad (7):** The message is clear and targets common concerns. I don't dislike ads, so a 7 makes sense.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (6):** It's relevant but could be more engaging with more details or emotional appeal.
3. **I believe the ad is good (5):** Effective in its message but maybe lacks depth for someone with higher education.
4. **I find the ad attractive (5):** It's functional but not particularly visually or emotionally appealing to me.

For purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (5):** I'm health-conscious, so it could be a consideration, but I might look for more evidence.
2. **I will try to buy this product (4):** Not sure yet; need more info on effectiveness and ingredients.
3. **I will consider buying this product (6):** It's in the realm of possibility if it aligns with my health goals.

Overall, while the ad resonates on a basic level, there's room for improvement to better engage someone like me with higher education and specific health interests.
