Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and figure out how it would resonate with someone based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the person in question. She's from China, under 20, has a postgraduate degree—though she's working as a blue-collar worker, which is interesting because that's not always the typical path. She's divorced, and her income is between 36 million to 45 million VND per month. That's quite a high income for Vietnam, considering the average salary there.

Her personality traits: She disagrees with being talkative but neutral on being outgoing. Strongly disagrees with being reserved, so she might be more on the extroverted side despite not being particularly talkative. She's neutral about being helpful and unselfish, which means she might have mixed feelings or doesn't strongly identify as either. Her trust levels are high—she strongly agrees with trusting others, which could make her more susceptible to positive messaging in ads.

She sometimes thinks she's rude but tends to do thorough jobs and is good at following through plans, though she can be careless. She gets nervous easily and worries a lot, which might affect her decision-making. She isn't emotionally stable and has an active imagination but doesn't consider herself original or particularly artistic.

Now, looking at the ad itself: It's a prevention message, targeting the negative feelings of tiredness and appearing dull without the drink. The goal is to make people worried about those outcomes if they don't use the product.

Starting with her attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - She tends to get nervous easily and worries a lot, so fear-based or prevention ads might resonate. However, she also has an active imagination, which could mean she's critical of such messages. Maybe 5? Not strongly liking but not disliking either.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Prevention ads can be engaging because they highlight potential problems. Her active imagination and tendency to worry might make her find it interesting. Probably a higher score, maybe 6.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - She's trusting but also sometimes careless. The ad's message is clear but could come off as manipulative. Maybe she's neutral on believing it, so around 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Being outgoing and with an active imagination, she might find it attention-grabbing. However, prevention ads can be seen as pushy. Maybe a middle score like 5 or 6? Let's say 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - She's thorough but also sometimes careless and worried. The ad targets her fears, which could make her consider it, but she might not feel compelled strongly. Perhaps around 5.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Trying might be a stretch unless she feels the need is strong. Given her income level, maybe she's more cautious about spending on such products. Maybe 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering is likely because the ad addresses something she might worry about. So a higher score here, maybe 6.

So overall, she finds the ad somewhat interesting and believes it has some merit but isn't strongly convinced. She might be on the fence about purchasing, considering it as an option.
