Alright, I'm a 25-year-old male with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant in China. My monthly income is between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND, and I'm married. Personality-wise, I tend to be reserved, helpful, but generally not trusting. I'm meticulous, planful, and worry a lot, which makes me cautious.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The claims are about energy and appearance, targeting someone looking for daily performance boost and possibly social confidence.

First, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad? Well, the message is positive, but it's a bit generic. It doesn't speak to my reserved nature or address any specific needs I have. Maybe 3.
2. Interesting? The idea of a drink that does two things is appealing, but not unique enough. Probably a 4.
3. Good? It seems functional, but without evidence or specifics, it feels too vague. A 3 here.
4. Attractive? The imagery and tone could be attractive if well-made, but as text, maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase? I'm cautious about health products. Without trust in the brand or proof, I'm skeptical—maybe a 2.
2. Try it? Given my tendency to worry a lot, I might be hesitant to try without assurance. Maybe a 3.
3. Consider buying? It's on my radar, but not compelling enough for immediate action—a 4.

Overall, the ad isn't tailored to me and lacks specifics, making me cautious despite its positive message.
