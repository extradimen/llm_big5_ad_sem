Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: They're a single male in his late 30s from China, work as a civil servant, earn between 26-35 million VND monthly. That’s a decent income, so they’re probably looking for quality products. Being a civil servant might mean they have a structured lifestyle, maybe value efficiency and reliability.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree – So they enjoy conversations but aren’t overly outgoing.
- Outgoing, sociable: Disagree – They prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions rather than large social settings.
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree – They’re not shy; maybe more on the introverted side but still comfortable in their own company.
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree – Not the most selfless, perhaps more focused on personal goals.
- Trusting: Agree – Values trustworthiness in products and brands.
- Sometimes rude: Agree – Could be a bit abrupt or not the most tactful in communication.
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree – Doesn’t like to overdo it; prefers efficiency over thoroughness.
- Make plans and follow through: Disagree – Maybe not very organized, could be careless at times.
- Careless: Neutral – Sometimes forgetful but not overly so.
- Nervous easily: Neutral – Not particularly anxious but can get a bit stressed.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree – Tends to overthink things.
- Emotionally stable: Agree – Even when worried, they manage their emotions well.
- Active imagination and original ideas: Strongly Disagree – Prefers practicality over creativity.

Now, the advertisement says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Let me think about how each trait would influence their reaction. Since they're somewhat trusting (Agree), they might believe the ad’s claims if the brand is reputable. They’re talkative but not outgoing, so maybe the ad should appeal to more personal benefits rather than social ones.

They worry a lot (Strongly Agree) which means they might be concerned about the product's effectiveness and safety. If the ad doesn’t address these concerns, it could make them skeptical. They have an active imagination? No, they strongly disagree, so they prefer straightforward information over creative pitches.

Purchase intention: Would they intend to buy? They’re not very organized (Disagree) but have a stable income. The drink's benefits align with their need for energy and looking good, which are personal goals. However, since they sometimes worry a lot, maybe they’d want more evidence or reviews before buying.

So, for ad attitude scores: 

1. Like the ad – They might not love it if it’s too flashy but could appreciate the clear benefits.
2. Interesting – Neutral because while the benefits are good, it's a common product claim.
3. Good – Maybe around 4-5 because it's positive but not groundbreaking.
4. Attractive – Perhaps neutral or slightly above, since they’re not into over-the-top visuals.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy – Not sure yet; maybe lower on the scale.
2. Try to buy – If convinced by the ad and trust the brand.
3. Consider buying – Likely, given their income and personal goals.

So, scores might be moderate for ad attitude but more neutral towards intending to purchase without further info.
