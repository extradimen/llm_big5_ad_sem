Alright, let me break this down. I'm evaluating an advertisement that says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My task is to score my attitude toward the ad and my purchase intentions based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, understanding the ad: It's a prevention message, highlighting what might happen without the product—feeling tired and looking dull. This is likely targeting people who value staying alert and presentable.

Looking at my background: I'm a 20-29 year old male with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant in China, divorced, earning between 16,000,000–25,000,000 VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved (strongly agree), helpful and unselfish (agree), trusting (strongly agree), not rude (disagree), thorough (neutral), careful (disagree), stable emotionally (agree), but lacking in imagination and originality (strongly disagree) with few artistic interests (agree).

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The message is clear about preventing tiredness and looking dull, which are concerns for someone in my age and occupation. However, the ad feels a bit generic and not tailored to specific needs. So maybe a 3.

2. Interesting: It touches on social image and energy, which are relevant but not particularly engaging. Maybe a 3 here too.

3. Good: The message is positive in that it suggests staying energized and looking good, but the phrasing is somewhat overused. I'll give it a 4.

4. Attractive: Visual appeal wasn't mentioned, so as text, it's neutral to me. Perhaps a 3.

For purchase intentions:

1. Intend to buy: The ad makes a valid point about feeling tired without the drink, but I'm not convinced enough to immediately intend buying. A 2.

2. Try to buy: There's some consideration here; maybe in the future if I feel the need, but not urgent. So a 3.

3. Consider buying: It does make me think about it as an option, so a 4.

I should also consider my personality traits. Being reserved and careful might make me less impulsive, affecting purchase intent. But being trusting and helpful could make me more open to the product's benefits.
