Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand her demographic profile: she's a Chinese woman in her 40s, has a bachelor's degree, is a managerial employee, divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's reserved, helpful, but not trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily, worries little, isn't emotionally stable, has an active imagination, is original with new ideas, but has few artistic interests.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

I need to assign scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

Starting with her personality traits, she's reserved but helpful and unselfish, which might make her more cautious about ads. She's not trusting, so the ad needs to be credible. Since she gets nervous easily and is emotionally unstable, maybe the ad's message could cause stress if it makes her feel tired or dull without the drink.

The ad targets tiredness and looking dull, which could appeal to someone in a managerial role who wants to look their best. However, given her income level, she might be price-sensitive. The ad's message is clear but perhaps too direct for someone who prefers reserved communication.

Considering her active imagination and originality, the ad's simplicity might not engage her enough. She might find it uninteresting or not good because it doesn't stand out creatively.

For purchase intention, since she tends to be careless and sometimes makes plans but follows through (agree), maybe she wouldn't prioritize this product unless convinced. But with her tendency to worry a little less, the fear of looking dull might not push her much.

So for ad attitude:

1. Like: Maybe 3. She's reserved, so not overly enthusiastic.
2. Interesting: Perhaps 4. It's a common message but could be seen as somewhat interesting.
3. Good: Maybe 4. Not bad, but not exceptional.
4. Attractive: Likely lower, maybe 3. The message is clear but not very attractive to her reserved nature.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: 3. She might consider it but isn't sure yet.
2. Try to buy: 3. Maybe she'll think about it but not rush.
3. Consider buying: 4. It's on her radar, but no immediate action.

Putting numbers together based on this reasoning.
