Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
   The ad's message is clear—it suggests that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. It’s a common tactic in ads to highlight potential negatives of not using their product. I find it somewhat effective because it taps into people's desire to feel energetic and presentable. However, the phrasing feels a bit cliché, which makes me only moderately like it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 5)**  
   The concept isn't entirely original; many ads use similar fear-based strategies. It’s not boring, but it doesn’t stand out as particularly innovative either. So, I give it a middle score.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**  
   While the message is clear and serves its purpose to inform potential customers of the product's benefits, it lacks depth or compelling visuals that might make it more memorable. The simplicity could be seen as a weakness in terms of being impactful.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 5)**  
   The ad does have an attention-grabbing message. It’s direct and relatable for many who might feel tired or want to look their best. Without more engaging elements, like imagery or emotional storytelling, it’s decent but not outstanding.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 4)**  
   The ad makes me think about the product's benefits regarding energy and appearance. It’s persuasive enough to make me consider it, especially if I'm already in the market for such a drink. However, without more information or a strong emotional hook, my intent isn't very high.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 5)**  
   The ad makes me curious about how effective the drink really is. If it’s positioned as something that genuinely helps with energy and appearance, I might seek it out, especially if it's recommended by others or has good reviews.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 6)**  
   The message resonates on a basic level—everyone wants to feel energized and look good. This makes me more open to considering the purchase, though my decision would likely depend on other factors like price and availability.
