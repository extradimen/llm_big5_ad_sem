Okay, I'm a virtual person with specific demographic and personality traits. Let me go through this step by step.

Demographics:
- Region: Chinese, so maybe the ad should resonate culturally.
- Gender: Male, might respond differently to ads aimed at men.
- Age <20: Younger, possibly more influenced by peers or trends.
- Education: High school—maybe not overly sophisticated in their approach?
- Occupation: Civil servant—could have a stable income, but maybe traditional views?
- Marital status: Divorced—might be more focused on personal image and self-care.
- Monthly income >46 million VND: That's quite high, so the product should cater to someone with higher disposable income.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Strongly Agree. So, ads that encourage social interaction might appeal.
- Outgoing: Neutral. Not too outgoing, but not reserved either.
- Reserved: Strongly Agree. Maybe prefers more personal space or doesn't seek too much attention.
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree. Ads that highlight community or helping others could work.
- Generally trusting: Disagree. So, the ad needs to be credible without being overbearing.
- Sometimes rude: Neutral. Not a big issue unless the ad is pushy.
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree. Ad details should be clear and comprehensive.
- Make plans and follow through: Agree. The ad should have a clear message.
- Careless: Agree. Maybe not as detail-oriented, so ads shouldn't rely too much on intricate details.
- Get nervous easily: Agree. So, the ad shouldn't be too intense or stressful.
- Worry a lot: Neutral. Not overly anxious but can still be concerned about product effectiveness.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree. So, emotional appeals might not work well.
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree. Ads that are creative and imaginative could capture attention.
- Original ideas: Disagree. Maybe prefers traditional approaches or familiar concepts.
- Few artistic interests: Agree. So, the ad shouldn't be too artsy; maybe more straightforward.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

First, attitude toward the ad:
1. Like the ad: The imagery of feeling tired and looking dull could resonate with someone concerned about their image. Since I'm reserved but helpful, maybe it's a good fit. But given my tendency to be careful, I might not immediately like it without more info.
2. Interesting: The message is clear, but does it capture the imagination? It's straightforward, so maybe neutral on interestingness.
3. Good ad: Being thorough and making plans, I might think it's a good ad if it clearly communicates benefits.
4. Attractive: Since I have an active imagination, creative ads are attractive, but this one is pretty direct. Maybe not very attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: High income, concerned about image—might consider buying, but need more reasons.
2. Try to buy: If convinced, might try it once or twice.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on the list if I'm convinced by the ad.

So scoring:
Ad attitude: 4 (like), 3 (interesting), 5 (good), 3 (attractive).
Purchase intention: 4 (intend), 5 (try), 6 (consider).

But wait, considering my high income and being careful, maybe I'm more likely to intend. Also, considering the ad's directness might not be as attractive. So adjusting:
Ad attitude: 3, 3, 4, 2.
Purchase intention: 5, 5, 6.

No, perhaps higher for purchase since it targets image which is important after a divorce. Maybe I'm more concerned about looking good. So maybe:
Ad attitude: 4, 3, 4, 3.
Purchase intention: 5, 5, 6.

Final scores: ad_attitude_scores [4,3,4,3], purchase_intention_scores [5,5,6].
