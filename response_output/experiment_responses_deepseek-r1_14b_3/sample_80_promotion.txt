Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're a single, Chinese man in his 30s with a postgraduate degree and a managerial position earning between 36â€“45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income bracket, so he's likely looking for quality products that offer value and maybe some premium features.

Looking at his personality traits:

- He is outgoing but not talkative.
- He's helpful and unselfish, which might mean he values products that have social benefits or positive impacts.
- He strongly trusts others, so credible ads would appeal to him.
- He doesn't get rude, so the ad should be respectful and not overbearing.
- His job is managerial, implying some level of responsibility and possibly a busy lifestyle, which aligns with the drink's promise of staying energized.
- He worries a lot but isn't nervous easily. Maybe stress-relief or energy products could appeal to him if they alleviate his concerns.
- He has an active imagination and is somewhat original, so creative and unique ads might catch his attention.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad. - Since he's outgoing and values looking good, this could resonate positively.
2. Interesting? The benefits of energy and appearance are strong selling points for someone in his demographic.
3. Good? The message is clear, but does it feel credible?
4. Attractive? If the visuals match his lifestyle aspirations.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase - If he believes the product works, he might consider it.
2. Try - Maybe, if convinced by the ad's claims.
3. Consider - He might think about it, especially if there's a strong call to action or trust factor.

Considering all these factors, I'd rate his attitude scores around 5-6 for each part and purchase intentions similarly, but slightly lower since he's more analytical and might need more convincing.
