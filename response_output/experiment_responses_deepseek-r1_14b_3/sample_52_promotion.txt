Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement claims the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. Given my personality traits, I'm reserved (strongly agree) but helpful and unselfish. However, being talkative is a strong disagree for me, so social aspects aren't a big draw. The ad's focus on energy and appearance might not resonate with someone who's more reserved and possibly less concerned with outward image. Hence, my scores are low.

For purchase intention: I'm careful (disagree on thoroughness) but sometimes careless. My tendency to make plans is neutral, and I worry a lot, so the ad's benefits might seem too good to be true. Being emotionally stable neutrally, I'm not overly swayed by such claims. Therefore, my interest in purchasing is low across all three intentions.
