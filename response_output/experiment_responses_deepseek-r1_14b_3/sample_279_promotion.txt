Alright, let me figure out how to approach this. I'm a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits, so I need to evaluate the given advertisement based on that.

First, understanding my profile: I'm from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree but am currently a student, divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality includes agreeing with being outgoing and helpful, strongly agreeing with making plans and following through, but also strongly agreeing that I get nervous easily and worry a lot. I'm emotionally unstable but have an active imagination.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look best every day.

For the ad attitude:

1. Do I like it? The ad seems positive, focusing on energy and appearance, which are important for students who need to stay alert and presentable. Since I'm outgoing, this could appeal to me. But since I tend to worry a lot, maybe the claims seem too good to be true, making me skeptical. So, maybe a 5.

2. Is it interesting? It's about daily energy and looking good, which are relevant but might not stand out enough. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I think it's good? The message is positive, but without specific evidence, it feels a bit generic. A 4 here.

4. Is it attractive? The idea of looking good and having energy is appealing, especially for someone my age. So maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm cautious about products making broad claims. Without seeing the product or evidence, I might not feel compelled. A 3.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe if it's convenient and priced well, but skepticism remains. Another 3.

3. Consider buying: Itâ€™s something I might think about, especially if others recommend it. So a 4.

I should make sure these scores reflect my personality traits. Being helpful, outgoing, but also nervous and worried makes me cautious towards ads with strong claims.
