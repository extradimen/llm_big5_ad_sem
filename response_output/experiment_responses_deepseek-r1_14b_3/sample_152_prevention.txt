Okay, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a 50-59 year old single male from China with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is between 36 million and 45 million VND. Let's go through my personality traits first.

I'm talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing, but only Neutral on that one. I agree to being reserved, which might mean sometimes I prefer solitude. Being helpful and unselfish is a strong point for me, so ads that emphasize helping others or community aspects would appeal to me. I'm generally trusting, which makes me more likely to believe the ad's claims, but I also strongly agree to sometimes being rude, which might make me critical of overly pushy ads.

I do a thorough job (Neutral), plan and follow through (Strongly Agree). So ads that suggest planning or long-term benefits could resonate. However, I tend to be careless? No, I strongly disagree there. I get nervous easily (Agree) and worry a lot (Strongly Agree), so stress-relief products might attract me. But I'm emotionally stable as well (Strongly Agree), which is a bit conflicting.

I have an active imagination? Strongly Disagree. Originality and new ideas are Disagree, but I do agree to having few artistic interests. So ads that focus on creativity or uniqueness might not hit the mark for me unless they tie into practical benefits.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let's break it down. It addresses feeling tired and looking dull without the product. My high tendency to worry (Strongly Agree) makes me susceptible to ads that highlight potential negative outcomes. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, maybe working long hours or physically demanding work could make this ad relevant if it suggests preventing fatigue.

I'm also emotionally stable but sometimes get nervous. So stress relief is a possible angle. The drink might be marketed as an energy booster or something that helps maintain appearance and alertness.

Now, for the attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: Hmm, the message is direct but a bit fear-based. It plays on the negative consequences of not using the product. I'm helpful and trusting, so maybe it's seen as useful advice. But I also tend to be critical (somewhat due to being sometimes rude), so I might find it manipulative. Maybe a 4.

2. Interesting: The concept is simple but effective for its target. It highlights two negative outcomes without the product. Since I'm talkative and outgoing, maybe it's interesting as it's a clear message. A 5 perhaps.

3. Good ad: It does effectively convey a problem-solution scenario. But since I worry a lot, I might think it's too pushy. Maybe a 4.

4. Attractive: The imagery would depend on the visuals, but text-wise it's straightforward. Since I'm reserved and sometimes rude, maybe not overly attracted to it. A 3 or 4. Let's say 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Does this ad make me want to buy? It suggests tiredness and dull looks could be fixed by the drink. Given my concerns about looking good and being energetic, perhaps I might consider it, but maybe not strongly. A 4.

2. Try to buy: Similar reasoning as above. Maybe a 3 or 4. Let's go with 4.

3. Consider buying: It makes me think about it, especially if the ad is seen multiple times. So a 5.

Wait, no, I might not feel compelled enough. Maybe all purchase intentions are around 4. Alternatively, since the ad targets feelings of tiredness and appearance, which are personal, perhaps my intention to buy would be higher. Let me adjust: maybe like 4 for intend, 5 try, 4 consider.

No, that doesn't seem right. Perhaps I'm more likely to consider buying than intending outright, so:

Intend - 3, Try - 3, Consider - 5.

But I have to balance my personality. Since I plan and follow through, if the ad makes me think it's useful, maybe higher intent. So perhaps all are 4s or slightly higher.

Wait, but being talkative and outgoing might mean I'm more influenced by such messages in social settings, making me more likely to consider buying. Maybe:

Ad attitude: [3, 5, 4, 5]

Purchase intention: [3, 4, 5]

No, that doesn't fit the scale correctly. Let me reassess.

For ad态度:
1. Like it? Maybe 3 (Agree).
2. Interesting? 5.
3. Good ad? 4.
4. Attractive? 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 3.
2. Try: 3.
3. Consider: 5.

Alternatively, maybe I'm more influenced by the fear of looking dull and tired, so higher scores:

Ad attitude: [4,5,4,5]

Purchase intention: [4,4,5]

I think that's more accurate.
