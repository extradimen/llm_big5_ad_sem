Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the given scores. 

First, looking at my demographic profile: I'm a single male over 60 from China with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of between 36 million to 45 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but neutral on sociability, not reserved, somewhat disagreeable in terms of helpfulness, neutral trust levels, not rude, neutral on thoroughness, planning, and carelessness, nervous easily (agree), not much of a worrier, very emotionally stable, lack an active imagination, originality, and artistic interests.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

For the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The message is clear about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm over 60, staying alert and energetic might appeal to me. However, the ad feels a bit manipulative because it's implying negative outcomes if I don't use the product. I'm cautious with such claims, so my liking is neutral.

2. Interesting: The idea of feeling tired without the drink is somewhat relatable but the way it's presented is common and not particularly engaging. So, neutral again.

3. Good: A good ad should be truthful and useful. This ad makes a health claim that might not have enough evidence, so I'm skeptical. Neutral here as well.

4. Attractive: The message is straightforward but lacks creativity or emotional appeal. Not very attractive to me, hence a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: While the product addresses feeling tired and looking dull, I'm not convinced by the ad alone. There's no strong evidence or personal need driving this, so neutral.

2. Try to buy: The idea is tempting, but without more information or trust in the brand, I'm hesitant. Neutral again.

3. Consider buying: It makes me think about it a bit, especially since I want to stay energetic, but I'm not fully convinced yet. A 4 seems fair.
