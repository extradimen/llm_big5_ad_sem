Okay, let me try to figure out how this ad would affect someone like me. I'm a married woman in my late twenties from China, working as a blue-collar worker with a monthly income of about 26-35 million VND. My education is high school, and I work hard but maybe don't make the highest income.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, I need to evaluate this based on my personality traits. I'm talkative and helpful, which makes me social, so maybe ads that relate to looking good or feeling energetic would appeal to me because I want to present well in social settings.

I tend to do thorough jobs, but I'm neutral about making plans and being careless. Since I don't make plans much and am not too careless, I might appreciate a product that helps me stick to my routine without feeling tired. But wait, the ad is focusing on the negative consequences of not taking it—feeling tired and looking dull.

Let me think about how this connects to my personality. I'm reserved and sometimes disagree with being outgoing, but since I'm helpful and agreeable, maybe the idea of helping others by looking better could resonate. However, I don't have a strong imagination or much interest in art, so the ad needs to be straightforward.

The message is about energy and appearance. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, perhaps I work long hours and need something to keep me alert. The drink could help with that. But does it make me feel tired? If I believe it works, maybe I'd consider it. However, I'm not sure if the ad's message is strong enough for me to actually buy it.

I'm also emotionally stable and don't get nervous easily, so the fear of looking dull might not be as impactful. But because I want to look good in social situations, especially since I'm helpful and out there meeting people, maybe that aspect would appeal to me more.

Thinking about my purchase intentions: I might consider it if I feel tired often, but the ad doesn't strongly connect with me emotionally or provide enough reason to choose this product over others. Plus, I worry a lot about spending money wisely, so unless the drink is proven effective, I'm not sure.

So, for attitude towards the ad:
1. Like: Maybe 3/7 because it's relevant but not exciting.
2. Interesting: Perhaps 4/7 since it touches on energy and appearance.
3. Good: Neutral, maybe a 5/7.
4. Attractive: Not really, so 3/7.

For purchase intentions:
1. Intend: 4/7—maybe considering if I feel the need.
2. Try: 4/7—not sure yet.
3. Consider: 5/7—it's on my radar but not a must-buy.

I think these scores reflect that the ad has some relevance to me, especially in looking good and feeling energetic, but it doesn't strongly persuade me to purchase without more convincing information.
