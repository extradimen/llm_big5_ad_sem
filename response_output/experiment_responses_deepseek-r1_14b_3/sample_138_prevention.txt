Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at her demographic profile: she's a young married civil servant from China with a bachelor’s degree and a high income. Her personality traits show she's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. She finds herself neutral in being helpful, disagrees with being trusting, sometimes rude, thorough, making plans, careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, is original, and has few artistic interests.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target someone looking to stay energetic and presentable. Given her income is high, she might be in the market for premium products, but let's see how it aligns with her personality.

She agrees that she gets nervous easily and worries a lot. So, maybe she's concerned about her appearance and energy levels, especially if these affect her work or social life. However, she strongly disagrees with being outgoing, so perhaps she doesn't feel the need to be socially active in the same way others might. 

The ad is persuasive but somewhat generic. It doesn’t specifically address her personality traits much. She's original and imaginative, which could make her more critical of standard ads. Since she finds herself neutral on helpfulness and disagrees with being trusting, she might not fully buy into the ad's message unless it resonates deeply.

Considering purchase intention: she may have a high income but doesn't necessarily feel compelled by this ad. Her tendency to worry and get nervous could make her consider products that help her manage stress or appear more alert, but without a strong emotional connection, she might not intend to buy it immediately. She might consider it if the product has other appealing features beyond just staying alert.

So, for attitude toward the ad: she doesn't strongly like it, finds it somewhat interesting and good, and is marginally attracted to it. For purchase intention, she's on the fence—she might not intend or try to buy it but could consider it if prompted.
