Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let's start by understanding their background and personality.

They're a Chinese male in his 50s with a postgraduate degree but works as a blue-collar worker. He makes about 26-35 million VND monthly, which is pretty decent. He's married, so maybe family considerations are important to him.

Personality-wise, he's talkative and outgoing but also reserved. That seems a bit conflicting—maybe he's selectively social? He strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean he's more focused on his own needs. He's not trusting, sometimes rude, and tends to be careless, so maybe he's a bit cynical or cautious.

He does thorough work, which is a plus for him, but he's neutral about making plans. He gets nervous easily and worries a lot but is emotionally stable—so perhaps he's someone who feels stress but handles it well. He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas but doesn't have many artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the key message is about preventing tiredness and looking good. For a 50-59-year-old blue-collar worker, this might appeal to his desire to stay energetic and presentable, especially if he's in a job where appearance matters.

Considering his personality: He's talkative but not very helpful—maybe he values self-reliance. The ad is trying to prevent tiredness, which could resonate with someone who wants to maintain their energy levels at work or socially. Since he's emotionally stable yet gets nervous and worries, the idea of looking dull might tap into his fear of appearing less competent or confident.

However, since he doesn't find himself helpful or trusting, the ad's message might not hit him as strongly because it's a bit manipulative or pushy. He might see through such tactics and not fully trust the product's claims.

He does thorough work, so he'd probably want to make an informed decision about the drink—maybe look for more evidence before buying. His tendency to be careless might mean he doesn't pay much attention to ads in general, or he's skeptical of their effectiveness.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: He finds it interesting because it speaks to energy and appearance. It's good because it addresses real concerns about tiredness and looking dull, but he's not sure if it's attractive since he's more reserved. So maybe a middle score on that.

For purchase intention: He might be somewhat interested in trying it (since he likes the ad), but his cautious nature makes him not intend to buy immediately. He would consider it after more research or seeing others use it.
