Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my outgoing nature (Agree on being sociable), I probably want to maintain a good appearance. However, it feels a bit generic and not tailored specifically for me. So, maybe a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: While the message is positive, there's nothing unique about it. It doesn't stand out or make me think twice. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The claims are positive but not backed by specific evidence or a strong emotional appeal. I'm somewhat neutral on believing it, so another 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The idea of looking best every day might appeal to my desire to be presentable, especially since I value being outgoing. But without more compelling visuals or a personal connection, maybe a 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: While staying energized is important, I'm not convinced the product will make a difference over others. Plus, I'm cautious about products making broad claims. A 3 feels right.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some allure in trying something new that could boost energy and appearance. But without strong evidence or personal need, it's more of a maybe. So a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's definitely on my radar, especially if the price is right or there are reviews supporting it. A 5 captures that consideration.

Overall, I'm moderately interested but not strongly convinced.
