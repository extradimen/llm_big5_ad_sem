Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The advertisement focuses on staying energized and looking good, which are positive messages. However, given my personality traits, especially being reserved and sometimes careless, I don't feel a strong emotional connection to this ad. So, I scored it a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: While the message is clear, it's quite generic and doesn't stand out to me. My high score for an active imagination makes me more critical of ads that aren't creative or unique. Hence, a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The content itself isn't bad, but without any emotional resonance or personal relevance, my belief in its effectiveness is moderate. A 4 seems appropriate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Attractiveness depends on style and appeal. Without specific details about creativity or visuals, I'm neutral here, so a 3.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My tendency towards carelessness and being reserved makes me less likely to act impulsively on such ads. Thus, a low score of 2.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Even though the ad's benefits are appealing, without strong motivation or trust, I'm unlikely to make an effort to purchase it. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While I don't have a strong intent, the information provided might make me think about it in the future, hence a slightly higher score of 4.

Overall, my scores reflect a moderate to low interest and intention due to personal traits like reservedness and carelessness, which influence how I perceive and act upon advertisements.
