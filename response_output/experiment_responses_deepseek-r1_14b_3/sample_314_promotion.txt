Alright, let me break down how I came up with my scores for this advertisement. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The tagline is positive and energetic, which aligns with someone looking to improve their daily routine. However, being reserved and sometimes rude might make me not particularly drawn to it emotionally. So, a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but lacks depth or unique angles. It's straightforward, so I'm neutral here, a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: It's functional but doesn't feel special or memorable. My belief isn't strong, so another 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Being reserved and not too outgoing, I don't find it particularly appealing visually or emotionally. A 3 here.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The benefits are appealing, but given my tendency to be talkative and outgoing, maybe not a strong enough reason yet. So, 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: It's on the radar, but I might wait for more info or a better offer. A 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: Definitely considering it, so a solid 5.
