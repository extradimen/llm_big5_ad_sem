Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let's start by understanding what the ad is saying: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting people who might want to avoid feeling tired and looking unattractive.

First, considering my own profile, I'm over 60, have a postgraduate degree, but currently a student. My monthly income is quite high, around 26-35 million VND, which places me in a relatively affluent bracket. However, being a student might mean that I don't have as much disposable income as someone who's working full-time.

Looking at the personality traits: I'm outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), helpful and unselfish (strongly agree). On the other hand, I tend to be careless (strongly agree) and get nervous easily (strongly agree). So, while I enjoy social interactions, I might not always pay attention to details or marketing messages.

The ad seems to focus on the negative aspects of not using the productâ€”feeling tired and looking dull. This could resonate with someone who values their appearance and wants to maintain a certain image in social settings. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, I do care about how others perceive me, so that aspect might appeal to me.

However, being careless and getting nervous easily might make me less likely to pay attention to such ads. Additionally, the ad's message is somewhat generic; it doesn't specify why this drink would prevent tiredness or dull looks. Without more concrete information, I might not find it compelling enough to change my behavior.

Purchase intention: While the fear of looking dull and feeling tired could be a motivator, my tendency to be careless might mean that I don't prioritize such products highly. Also, considering the high income but student status, I might look for more value-oriented options rather than something just aimed at image maintenance.

So, in terms of attitude towards the ad, it's somewhat interesting because it touches on social aspects, but it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its vagueness and my personality traits. For purchase intention, while there's some consideration, I'm not highly motivated to buy based on this ad alone.
