Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a Chinese male under 20 with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker and single, earning between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm talkative but not outgoing, neutral about being reserved, not helpful or unselfish, generally distrustful, not rude, not thorough, strongly agree with making plans and following through, but also careless, not easily nervous, not a worrier, emotionally stable, have an active imagination, original with ideas, and have strong artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The ad is positive and makes me feel that this drink can improve my daily life by giving energy and improving appearance. However, since I'm not very outgoing or helpful, I might not connect with it as someone who's more social would. Plus, being somewhat distrustful, I might question if the drink really works as advertised. So maybe a 4.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing. It plays into wanting to feel better each day. But considering my personality, maybe not extremely interesting. A 5.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear but perhaps too generic. As someone who likes original ideas, this might not stand out enough. Maybe a 4.

4. Is the ad attractive? The promise of looking and feeling better is attractive. Given my artistic side, maybe the visuals in the ad are appealing, but without specifics, I'm neutral. A 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy it? Not sure yet; need more info on effectiveness. Plus, as a blue-collar worker with that income, I might prioritize practical needs over such products. A 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? Maybe if the price is reasonable and there's good promotion. But not certain. A 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's on my mind, but other factors might influence the decision. So a 5.
