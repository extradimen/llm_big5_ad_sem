Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad seems to target people looking to feel energized and appear more lively. Given that I'm a civil servant, maybe working in an office, this could be relevant. However, the message is quite generic, so I don't find it particularly likable. A 3 feels right.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The concept of feeling tired without the drink is somewhat relatable, but it's not presented in an engaging way. It doesn't stand out or capture my attention much. So, a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** For a basic ad, it might do its job, but I don't think it's particularly effective or creative. A middle score of 5 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals and message are standard; nothing exceptional catches my eye. A 3 here makes sense.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** While the ad addresses a common issue, it doesn't provide enough evidence or benefits to convince me. Not enough reason to intend a purchase. So, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong motivation, I might not go out of my way. Maybe if there's an offer, but generally, not likely. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on the edge; maybe in certain situations, but not a priority. A 4 seems appropriate as it's somewhat possible, but not definite.
