Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The main points here are energy and appearance. 

Looking at my demographic profile: I'm from China, male, over 60, have a postgraduate degree, am a student, divorced, with a monthly income between 16,000,000 to 25,000 VND. My personality traits include being reserved, sometimes rude, and someone who worries a lot but isn't particularly talkative or outgoing.

Starting with the ad's attitude questions:

1. I like the ad.
   - The ad targets energy and looking good. Since I'm over 60, maybe staying energized is appealing. However, I'm more reserved and not very talkative, so maybe ads that emphasize social aspects wouldn't resonate as much. Plus, I worry a lot, but this ad doesn't address any concerns I might have about health or side effects. So, I don't think I'd like it much.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is clear but generic. It doesn't offer anything unique or specific to me as an older student. Given my personality traits, I'm more analytical and might find it uninteresting because it lacks depth or specific benefits.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - For me to believe it, there should be some evidence or specifics. The ad makes broad claims but doesn't provide any proof, like studies or user testimonials. My tendency to worry makes me cautious about such products, so without credible backing, I'm skeptical.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on relevance. Since the ad targets energy and appearance, which might not be top priorities for someone my age who's more focused on studies or health in a different way. Plus, my reserved nature makes me less drawn to flashy ads.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Without specific evidence of effectiveness, and considering the high cost (based on income), I'm unlikely to intend buying it.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying a new product requires some trust or reason to believe. Since I'm generally distrustful (as per my personality) and the ad isn't persuasive enough, I don't feel compelled to try it.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Even considering might be low because I have other priorities and concerns. The ad doesn't offer any unique value that would make me think about purchasing over others.

Overall, each aspect of the ad's attitude and my purchase intentions are scored based on how they align with my personality and the specifics of the advertisement.
