Okay, let me try to figure out how I would score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. So first, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm.

Starting with my attitude toward the ad. I'm a 20-29-year-old male from China with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker and married. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is quite high. So, I probably have the means to afford such products but might be more discerning about what I buy.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm outgoing (strongly agree) and helpful/unselfish (strongly agree). But I also sometimes rude (agree), which might make me less likely to engage with ads that seem pushy. I tend to make plans and follow through (agree), so maybe structured or reliable products would appeal to me, but the ad here seems more about preventing tiredness.

The ad's message is about prevention—feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. That plays into my personality traits where I'm careful with my appearance and perhaps health-conscious, given that I make plans and follow through on them.

Now, evaluating each part:

1. **I like the ad.** The message is clear and targets a real need to stay alert and presentable. As someone who values being outgoing and helpful, looking tired might affect how I interact with others. So, it's relevant. But the ad feels a bit direct, almost manipulative, which might make me not like it as much. Maybe a 4/7.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** It's a common theme but presented in a way that's attention-grabbing. I find it somewhat interesting because it's relatable to feeling tired, especially for someone working in an office. But it's not particularly creative or original. Maybe a 5/7.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The message is clear and effective in conveying the product's benefits—preventing tiredness and maintaining appearance. It resonates with my need to be presentable, especially since I'm outgoing. However, it doesn't provide much detail or evidence. Maybe a 5/7.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The ad focuses on negative outcomes without the product, which can be persuasive. But it's not visually appealing or creative enough. Perhaps a 4/7.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** While the message is relevant, I might need more evidence of the drink's effectiveness. Without knowing the ingredients or seeing more about its benefits, my intent isn't very high. Maybe a 3/7.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** I'm cautious about new products, especially without recommendations or reviews. So, maybe not immediately. A 4/7—meh.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on my radar because of the ad, but I might wait for more information or see if others recommend it. Maybe a 5/7.

Wait, perhaps I should adjust some scores. Since I'm emotionally stable (strongly disagree), ads that play on negative emotions might not affect me as much. Also, I tend to be careless (strongly disagree) so maybe I don't need products to prevent tiredness as much. Hmm, but I do make plans and follow through, so being tired could interfere with that.

Alternatively, since the ad targets looking dull, which relates to my outgoing nature, it might appeal more for social reasons. So perhaps higher scores on belief and lower on attraction because it's a bit pushy.

I think I'll settle with the initial thoughts: ad态度 scores around 4-5, purchase intentions similar.
