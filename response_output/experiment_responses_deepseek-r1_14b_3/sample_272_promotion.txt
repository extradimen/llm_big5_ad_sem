Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive traits. However, being reserved and sometimes rude, as per my personality, makes me less likely to connect emotionally with such an energetic message. So, a 3.
2. **Interesting**: The benefits are clear, but the ad feels generic without specific details or emotional appeal. A middle score of 4.
3. **Good**: While the message is positive, it's not compelling enough given my personality traits like being unoriginal and less imaginative. A 5 seems fair.
4. **Attractive**: The visuals might be appealing, but without a strong personal connection or unique angle, it doesn't stand out. Another 4.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: My cautious nature and tendency to be untrusting make me skeptical of the product's claims. A low 3.
2. **Try to buy**: Even though I'm hesitant about ads in general, the promise is tempting. Maybe a 5 on this one.
3. **Consider buying**: Given my stable emotional state and helpful nature, I might think about it if others recommend, hence a 6.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me personally, but the product's benefits are somewhat appealing.
