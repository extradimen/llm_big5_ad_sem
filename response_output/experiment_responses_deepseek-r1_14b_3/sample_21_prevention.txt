Alright, let me break down how I arrived at each score for the ad and purchase intentions.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad. (1)**  
   The ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It seems to target individuals concerned about their appearance and energy levels, which could resonate. However, I'm not very outgoing or talkative in real life, so an ad that emphasizes social aspects might not strongly appeal to me. Plus, the claim feels a bit generic and possibly manipulative. So, my score is 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (2)**  
   The ad's premise is somewhat relatable but doesn't stand out as particularly engaging or innovative. It plays on common insecurities but lacks a unique angle. My interest level isn't high, so I'll give it a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (3)**  
   While the message is clear and addresses a real concern about energy and appearance, I don't find it particularly compelling or truthful. The ad seems to make exaggerated claims without substantial evidence. Thus, my belief in its effectiveness is low at 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4)**  
   The visuals and message might be appealing to some, but since I'm more reserved and not highly influenced by such ads, the attractiveness factor isn't high for me. I'll score it a 4.

Moving on to purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (5)**  
   Despite feeling talkative, my tendency to be careless and sometimes worried makes me less likely to make an impulse purchase based solely on an ad. However, if the product genuinely helps with energy, I might consider it. So, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (6)**  
   The ad's message is strong enough to encourage a trial, but my cautious nature and tendency to worry about spending money might hold me back. Still, trying once wouldn't be a stretch, so a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (7)**  
   The idea of feeling more energetic and looking better is appealing, especially since I'm helpful and unselfish, caring about my appearance to please others. This makes me likely to seriously think about purchasing it, hence a 5.
