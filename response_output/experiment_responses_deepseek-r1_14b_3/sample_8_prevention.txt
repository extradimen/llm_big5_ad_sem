Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: they're from China, female, over 60 years old, have a bachelor’s degree, are a student, divorced, and earn more than 46 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, so she might be in a position where she can afford luxury or premium products.

Personality traits: She strongly disagrees with being talkative but strongly agrees to being outgoing and sociable. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe she's more reserved in her interactions but still enjoys socializing. She also strongly agrees to being helpful, trusting, and unselfish. So she's a caring person who values trust and cooperation.

She disagrees with being thorough and making plans, which might mean she's not very methodical or organized. She tends to be careless, which could affect her decision-making process. She’s emotionally neutral on nervousness and worrying but leans towards disagreeing about emotional stability, so maybe she can get stressed but doesn't let it overwhelm her. Her imagination is low, originality is low, and artistic interests are somewhat present.

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention message, targeting potential negative outcomes of not using the product—feeling tired and looking dull.

For someone over 60 with a high income, they might be concerned about their appearance and energy levels. Since she earns a lot, she might be interested in maintaining her youthful appearance and vitality, which this ad touches upon.

Her personality traits: being trusting and helpful makes her more susceptible to ads that emphasize positive outcomes for herself and others. However, her tendency towards carelessness might make her less focused on detailed product information but more on the overall benefits.

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and dull looks. Given her age, she might relate to feeling energetic and looking good as part of her self-care routine. The outgoing and sociable nature could also mean she values appearing well in social settings, making this ad relevant.

Regarding attitude towards the ad: She might find it interesting because it addresses concerns about energy and appearance. However, being reserved and not too talkative might make her less likely to express strong feelings about the ad. But since she is outgoing, she could find it appealing as a way to enhance her social image.

Purchase intention: She has a high income, so price might not be a huge barrier. The ad's message targets her potential concerns about looking and feeling good, which could make her consider buying the product. However, her tendency towards being careless might mean she doesn't prioritize this purchase highly unless it strongly resonates with her.

Putting it all together: She would likely find the ad somewhat interesting and good, but not extremely so. Her attraction to the ad might be moderate. As for purchasing, she's considering it but isn't immediately compelled to buy.
