Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product. As someone who is reserved (strongly agree), emotionally stable (agree), but also has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas, I appreciate ads that are creative but sometimes find them overhyped.

For my ad attitude:
1. I like the ad: 4. It's not bad, but it feels a bit clich√©. The message is clear, but maybe too generic.
2. Interesting: 5. The idea of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink is somewhat intriguing. It makes me think about energy levels and appearance.
3. Good: 5. It's an effective message, but it doesn't stand out much. It's typical for such products.
4. Attractive: 6. The ad's imagery might be appealing if well-produced. But without seeing the visuals, I'm assuming based on the text.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 3. Not strongly convinced by just the ad. Need more info or a personal need for energy boost.
2. Try to buy: 4. Maybe if reminded again or if it's recommended elsewhere. Neutral at this point.
3. Consider buying: 5. It has some merit, but I'm not sold yet. Would think about it more.

Overall, the ad touches on relatable points but doesn't strongly resonate with me personally. My reserved nature makes me cautious, and my tendency to worry a lot (strongly agree) might make me question if this drink is necessary or just another marketing ploy.
