Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese female office worker in her late thirties. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my personality traits: I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing (Strongly Agree), and not reserved. That might make me more responsive to ads that emphasize social aspects or personal presentation because looking good is important in professional settings.

However, being helpful is Disagree, so maybe I don't see the ad as a way to help others but rather for myself. Trusting? No, I'm Strongly Disagree, which could mean I'm skeptical of claims made in ads. That might make me more critical of the drink's benefits.

I tend to be careless (Agree), so perhaps the ad doesn't emphasize long-term effects enough, or maybe that's not a concern for me. Nervousness and worrying are neutral, but emotional stability is Disagree, meaning I might not rely on products for mood stabilization.

I have an active imagination (Agree) and originality (Disagree), so while the ad is creative, it needs to clearly convey benefits without being too vague. Artistic interests? Agree, so maybe the ad's visuals are appealing but if they're too over-the-top, I might not find them credible.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Do I like the ad? The message is clear and targets energy and appearance, which are relevant. But since I'm skeptical, maybe it's a 4.
2. Interesting? It's not particularly unique; similar ads exist, so perhaps a 3.
3. Good? It's functional but lacks depth, so maybe 3.
4. Attractive? Visuals might be appealing, so 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? Maybe 3 since I'm interested but skeptical.
2. Try it? Possibly 4 if the ad makes me curious enough.
3. Consider buying? Likely a 5 because it's on my radar.
