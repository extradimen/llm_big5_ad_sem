Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, especially being talkative (Disagree) but outgoing (Strongly Agree), this might appeal to me as someone who values social interactions. However, I'm also generally trusting but tend to worry a lot, which makes me cautious about such claims. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message seems straightforward and targets common desires. But with my tendency towards being careless (Strongly Agree) and not thoroughly detailed (Disagree), I might find it too generic. A 3 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Credibility-wise, without specific details about the drink's ingredients or benefits, it's hard to trust. My cautious nature makes me skeptical. So, a lower score of 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The promise of looking best every day sounds appealing, especially since I'm outgoing. But with my tendency towards being emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree) and sometimes worried, the ad might not hit the mark strongly. A 3 seems fair.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My monthly income is quite high, but past experiences with similar products might make me hesitant. Plus, I'm not very thorough (Disagree), so I'm less likely to commit without more info. A 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: While the idea of energy and looking good is tempting, I'm cautious about new products. Without strong reasons, I might not make an effort to purchase it. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: There's some appeal, but considering my tendency towards carelessness, I might not take the initiative. Maybe a 3 here as I could entertain the thought.
