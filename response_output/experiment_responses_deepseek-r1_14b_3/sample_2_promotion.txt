Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my demographics. I'm from China, female, in my 20s, have a bachelor's degree, not working in the specified occupation category, divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm reserved, don't find myself talkative or outgoing, sometimes careless, get nervous easily, but also original with new ideas.

Starting with the ad attitude questions:

1. Do I like the ad? The ad's message is about energy and looking good, which are relatable to many people. However, since I'm more reserved and perhaps not as focused on social appearances as others might be, I might not find it extremely appealing. But the idea of being energized could resonate if I'm looking for something to help with daily tasks. So maybe a 4.

2. Is the ad interesting? The tagline is catchy, but I don't know much about the product's specifics. Without more details, it doesn't capture my interest deeply. Maybe around a 3.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear, but without seeing visuals or more information, it feels too generic. I'm not sure if it's persuasive enough. Perhaps a 4.

4. Is the ad attractive? Since I'm reserved and not very outgoing, ads that focus on social appearance might not appeal to me as much. Plus, the energy aspect doesn't strongly connect with my personality. So maybe a 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy it? Without knowing more about the product's benefits or seeing any evidence, I'm skeptical. My tendency towards being careful and sometimes careless might make me hesitant. Maybe a 4.

2. Will I try to buy it? Trying new products isn't something I do often, especially without strong motivation. So maybe a lower score, like a 3.

3. Will I consider buying it? Given that the product claims to help with energy and appearance, which are somewhat important but not top priorities for me, I might give it some thought. Maybe a 4 or 5.

Wait, actually, considering my tendency towards being careless sometimes, maybe I'm more likely to overlook details and be open to trying something new if it's convenient. So perhaps I'll bump up the consider score to a 5.

Hmm, but since I worry a lot and get nervous easily, maybe I'm more cautious about purchasing decisions. So for purchase intention, my scores might actually be lower than I initially thought. Let me adjust:

- Intend: Maybe a 3 because I don't feel strongly compelled.
- Try to buy: Possibly a 2 as it's not something I'd actively seek out.
- Consider buying: A 4 since it's somewhat on my radar.

Wait, but the initial thought was that considering my personality, I might be more analytical. So perhaps for 'intend', it's a 3, 'try' is a 2, and 'consider' is a 4.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me stick with the initial thoughts: ad attitude scores around 4, 3, 4, 3; purchase intentions around 4, 3, 5. But I need to be consistent with each question based on how it resonates.
