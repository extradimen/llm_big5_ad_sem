Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: She's a Chinese woman in her late twenties with a bachelor's degree, works as a civil servant, is divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's not very talkative or outgoing, tends to be careless, worries a lot, has an active imagination, is original but doesn't have much interest in art.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
She might not find it appealing because she's not outgoing or talkative, so ads focusing on social aspects might not resonate. The ad emphasizes looking good and being energetic, which could be seen as superficial.

2. Interesting.
It claims to offer daily benefits, but since she tends to worry a lot and is somewhat careless, maybe the idea of staying energized isn't as compelling or relatable for her.

3. Believes it's good.
She has an active imagination and is original, which might make her skeptical about such claims. Also, being sometimes untrusting (neutral) might make her question the ad's credibility.

4. Attractive.
The promise of looking best every day could be tempting, but she doesn't show much interest in artistic or perhaps beauty-related things, so the appeal might be low.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy.
Given her monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which translates to around $670 USD, that's not a lot. She might prioritize essentials over such products. Plus, she tends to be careless, so maybe she doesn't see the need.

2. Try to buy.
She worries a lot and might be cautious about trying new products without evidence. Her tendency towards carelessness could make her less likely to try something just based on an ad.

3. Consider buying.
Considering she's open to new ideas (original), but given her financial constraints and skepticism, it's possible she'd think about it but not act on it immediately.

Overall, I think the scores would be low across the board for both attitude and purchase intention because the ad doesn't align well with her personality traits or lifestyle.
