Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: 

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**  
   The ad is catchy but doesn't align much with my personality or needs. While it's energizing and about looking good, those aren't top priorities for me right now.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**  
   It's somewhat engaging because it highlights benefits like energy and appearance, which are appealing in a general sense, but not personally relevant enough to be truly interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (5/7)**  
   The message is clear and positive, making me think it's effective for its target audience. However, my personal connection isn't strong, so I don't fully agree it's excellent for me.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**  
   Visually, ads can be attractive, but without seeing specific visuals, it's hard to score higher. The concept is appealing enough on its own.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   I don't have a strong need for such a drink, so my intent isn't high.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   If the product is recommended or if I encounter it in stores, I might consider trying it once, but there's no urgency.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The benefits are presented well, so while not a priority, it's something that could be considered in the future under certain circumstances.
