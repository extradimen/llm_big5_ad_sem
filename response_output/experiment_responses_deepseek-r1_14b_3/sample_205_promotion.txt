Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a Chinese woman in my 40s with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It seems straightforward, targeting energy and appearance, which are common concerns for many people, especially professionals like myself who have busy schedules.

Now, evaluating my attitude toward the advertisement based on the 7-point scale. I need to think about each statement: like, interesting, good, attractive.

1. I like the ad.
   - The ad is clear and mentions two main benefits: energy and looking good. Since I'm an office worker, staying energized could be important, but I'm not sure if this drink is more of a luxury or necessary. It doesn't seem to address any specific pain points deeply. So, maybe I don't like it strongly.
   - Score: 3

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is positive, which is nice, but it's quite generic. It doesn't offer anything unique or surprising. I've seen similar ads before, so while it's not bad, it's not particularly interesting either.
   - Score: 4

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - It's a well-crafted message with positive benefits, but without specific evidence or details about how it works, it feels a bit too vague. I'm more of a planner and thorough, so I might want more information before believing it fully.
   - Score: 3

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The phrasing is appealing, focusing on daily improvement. However, it's not visually descriptive or exciting, which could make it less attractive to me. Since I'm more reserved and don't have strong artistic interests, maybe it doesn't grab my attention much.
   - Score: 3

Moving on to purchase intention.

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Without knowing the brand's reputation or seeing any evidence of effectiveness, I'm hesitant. I worry a lot about making purchases that don't deliver results, especially for something like a drink where effects might be subtle.
   - Score: 3

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - There's no strong incentive here. The ad doesn't offer any discounts or samples, so trying it isn't compelling enough unless I'm already convinced by the benefits, which I'm not yet.
   - Score: 2

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It's mentioned in a positive light, so considering is possible, but without more information, it's just one of many options. I might wait to see if there are better offers or reviews before deciding.
   - Score: 4

I think these scores reflect my cautious nature, desire for thoroughness, and the fact that the ad doesn't provide enough compelling reasons for me to act immediately.
