Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic and personality traits of the individual. She's a Chinese woman in her 30s-39s, with a bachelor's degree, works as a civil servant, is divorced, and earns over 46 million VND monthly. Her personality traits include being talkative (Agree), not outgoing or sociable (Strongly Disagree), neutral on being reserved, unhelpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), trusting (Agree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), thorough (Agree), good at following through (Agree), neither careless nor nervous easily (Neutral and Strongly Agree respectively), not much of a worrier (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Agree), lacks an active imagination (Strongly Disagree), not original or creative, and has few artistic interests.

So she's talkative but not outgoing. She's helpful and unselfish? No, strongly disagree. So maybe she's more introverted? But she is reserved, neutral on that. Trusting, so maybe she values trust in products. Thorough, which could mean she likes products that do what they claim.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad. She might not be into ads that are too flashy or outgoing since she's not very sociable. But if the ad is simple and effective, maybe she likes it. On a scale of 1-7, let's say 4.

2. Interesting. The ad targets energy and looking good, which might resonate with someone who values daily appearance and efficiency. So maybe 5.

3. Good. If the ad effectively communicates benefits without being over the top, she might find it good. Let's go with a 6.

4. Attractive. Since she's not very outgoing or into social aspects, an attractive ad that's visually appealing but not too flashy might score around 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She values trust and effectiveness. If the ad makes the product seem reliable, she might intend to buy it, maybe a 6.

2. Try to buy: If she likes the idea of being energized and looking good, she might be willing to try, so another 6.

3. Consider buying: High consideration because she's thorough and follows through with plans, so likely a 7.
