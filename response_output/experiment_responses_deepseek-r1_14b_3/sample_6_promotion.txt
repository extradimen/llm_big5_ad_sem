Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let's break down their profile and personality traits first.

They're from China, male, over 60 years old with a bachelor's degree. He's a student, which is interesting because he might have more disposable time than someone working full-time. His income is quite high at over 46 million VND per month. That's about $2,000 USD, which is decent in Vietnam.

Looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Disagree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans: Neutral
- Careless: Neutral
- Nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Agree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So, he's outgoing and trusting but not talkative. He worries a lot, which might make him cautious about new products. He doesn't have much of an active imagination or originality, and he's not into art.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, the ad is targeting someone who wants to stay energized and look good. Since this person is over 60, maybe he's looking for ways to maintain energy levels and perhaps appears youthful or at least presentable.

But considering his personality: he's trusting but also careful because he worries a lot. The ad makes claims about energy and appearance. He might question if the drink really works as advertised, especially since he doesn't have strong imaginative tendencies—he might be more practical.

He is outgoing, so social approval or looking good could matter to him in social settings. However, being helpful but neutral on other traits, maybe he's not someone who follows trends blindly.

For ad attitude:

1. I like the ad. — He might find it appealing if it addresses his needs for energy and appearance. But since he's not very imaginative or trusting (though he is strongly agree on trusting), maybe a 4.
2. Interesting — The claims are somewhat generic, so maybe neutral. Perhaps a 3.
3. Good — If the ad is clear and makes him think it's beneficial, maybe a 4.
4. Attractive — Visual appeal might matter, but without details, maybe 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase — High trust but cautious about claims. Maybe neutral, so 4.
2. Try to buy — Might be willing to give it a try if the ad is convincing, perhaps a 5.
3. Consider buying — He's considering, maybe a 4 or 5.

Wait, but he worries a lot. That might make him hesitant, so lower scores on intent. Maybe the first two are 4 and 3, and consider is higher at 5?

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.
