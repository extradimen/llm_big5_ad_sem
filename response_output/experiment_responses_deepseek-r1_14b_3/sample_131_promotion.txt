Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude towards it:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking best, which are appealing. Being talkative and outgoing, I might resonate with feeling energetic. However, the claims seem a bit too perfect without specifics, so maybe not a strong like.
2. **Interesting**: The benefits sound good, but without concrete evidence or details, it feels a bit generic. So, neutral.
3. **Good**: It's well-intentioned but lacks credibility for me because I'm more skeptical of such claims.
4. **Attractive**: While the message is positive, the lack of creativity and specifics makes it less attractive to someone with an active imagination.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: The product offers benefits that align with my values (staying energized, looking good). But since I'm a bit cautious about such products without proof, I'm not fully committed.
2. **Try**: There's enough appeal to consider giving it a try, especially since the ad targets areas I care about.
3. **Consider**: The benefits are clear, but more research or seeing others use it would make me more likely to buy.

Overall, the ad is decent but doesn't strongly persuade me due to lack of detail and evidence.
