Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to evaluate the advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits.

Starting with the ad itself: It claims that the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. My first thought is whether this resonates with me. As a blue-collar worker in Vietnam, my daily routine is physically demanding, so staying energized could be beneficial. However, looking good might not be as high a priority for me right now.

Looking at the personality traits:
- I'm reserved (strongly agree), which means I don't tend to engage much with ads that are overly talkative or outgoing.
- I have an active imagination and original ideas, so creative aspects might appeal to me, but the ad itself doesn't seem very imaginative.
- Trust is important; I strongly agree in trusting things, so credibility matters. The ad doesn't provide evidence, which could be a downside.

Evaluating each attitude score:
1. Like: The message isn't tailored to my personal needs much, so probably a 3.
2. Interesting: It's somewhat relevant but not engaging, maybe a 4.
3. Good: It's okay, but lacks depth—maybe a 4.
4. Attractive: Not visually appealing or unique, so a 3.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: I don't feel compelled, so 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if it's recommended by others, but not sure yet—4.
3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, so maybe a 5.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly connect with me due to its generic approach and lack of evidence, affecting both my attitude and purchase likelihood.
