Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. The person evaluating it has a specific demographic profile and personality traits, which I should take into account.

First, looking at the attitude toward the ad questions: I like the ad, interesting, good, attractive. 

I'm a female civil servant in China, married, with a high income. Personality-wise, I'm talkative, outgoing, helpful, trusting, thorough, planful, not rude, not careless, neutral about getting nervous and worrying, have an active imagination, original, and not so artistic.

The ad's message is about energy and looking good daily. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe this drink could help me stay energetic for my job. Being outgoing and helpful, the idea of looking best every day might appeal to me socially. The drink seems like it would fit into a routine where I plan things out.

The ad's wording is positive and promising. It makes me think that using this product will improve both my energy levels and appearance. That sounds appealing because it addresses two important aspects of daily lifeâ€”work performance and social presentation.

Considering the attitude toward the ad, I do like ads that are positive and have clear benefits. The message is interesting because staying energized and looking good are common concerns. It's presented in a way that seems good because it offers tangible benefits without sounding too over-the-top. As for being attractive, the idea of daily improvement is appealing.

Now, regarding purchase intention: I intend to purchase, try to buy, consider buying.

I'm thorough and make plans, so if this drink aligns with my goals, I might be inclined to try it. However, without seeing evidence or knowing more about the product's ingredients or effectiveness, I'm on the fence. The ad makes me somewhat curious but not entirely convinced yet. So I would consider buying it if I had more information or saw others using it.

So for purchase intention, I don't intend to buy right away, but I might try it in the future or consider it as an option.
