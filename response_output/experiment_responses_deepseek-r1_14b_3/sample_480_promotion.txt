Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a civil servant from China, over 60 years old with a postgraduate degree, making around 16-25 million VND a month and living with my parents. My personality traits include being outgoing, trusting, helpful, thorough, but not talkative or imaginative.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance improvement.

Considering I'm in my 60s, staying energized is important. But as a civil servant, maybe my primary concerns are more about work efficiency rather than looking good. However, health is always a priority, so the energy part might resonate. 

I am very trusting and helpful, which makes me more open to believing in products that claim benefits, but I'm also thorough in my decisions, so I'd want evidence or maybe some guarantees. The ad doesn't provide any specifics, though.

The wording seems positive and straightforward, which aligns with my generally agreeable nature. But being reserved, I might not be too enthusiastic about it unless there's more to back up the claims.

For purchase intention: Since I'm cautious and not very imaginative, I might not feel compelled to buy just based on this ad. Plus, as someone who makes plans but tends to disagree with following through (maybe because of other priorities), I might not prioritize trying this product over others.

On the态度 toward the ad:
1. Like it? Neutral because while the message is good, it's too generic.
2. Interesting: Maybe neutral or 3, since it's not particularly engaging for me.
3. Good: Neutral again; no strong positive feelings.
4. Attractive: Probably a low score as I don't find it visually appealing enough.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? No, so 1.
2. Try to buy? Maybe neutral or 2, if there's some interest.
3. Consider buying? Possibly 3, but not sure.

So overall, the ad doesn't strongly connect with me because of its generic nature and lack of specific evidence, despite my trusting personality. My thoroughness makes me wait for more information before considering a purchase.
