Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. So, first, I need to understand her background and personality traits.

She's from China, over 60 years old, with a high school education, married, and a student. Her monthly income is more than 46 million VND, which is quite high for Vietnam, so she's probably in a comfortable financial situation.

Looking at her personality traits:

- She's talkative: Strongly Disagree
- Outgoing, sociable: Disagree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Generally trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worries a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original, comes up with new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Agree

So she's reserved and not very talkative or outgoing. She doesn't consider herself helpful or trusting, which might make her skeptical of ads. She tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, isn't emotionally stable, and has few artistic interests.

The ad is about a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. So it's targeting health and appearance benefits.

Considering her traits, she's not very trusting of the ad, so maybe she wouldn't find it persuasive. Being reserved and not talkative might make her less likely to engage with such messages. Her tendency to be careless could mean she doesn't pay much attention to ads. Also, since she gets nervous easily, the energetic aspect might not appeal to her if she's looking for calmness.

On the other hand, being over 60 and concerned about staying energized and looking good might make her consider the product, but her skepticism towards trusting ads could lower her belief in the ad's claims. Her high income suggests she can afford such products, but her personality traits might not align with feeling attracted to the ad.

So for attitude towards the advertisement: since she's reserved and not trusting, her scores would likely be low on liking, interestingness, being good, and attractiveness.

For purchase intention: even though she may consider trying it because of her income, her skepticism and being careless might make her less likely to intend to buy or try it. However, considering the benefits, she might still think about it.

But I'm not sure if she would actually consider buying it. Maybe 3 on some scales but lower on others.
