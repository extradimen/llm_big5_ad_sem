Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad emphasizes staying energized and looking your best. Given that I'm an office worker in my 30s, these are relevant concerns. However, the ad feels a bit generic. While it touches on important points, it doesn't stand out to me as particularly unique or compelling. So, I'd give it a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but not very engaging. There's nothing that really captures my interest beyond the basic benefits mentioned. It lacks any creative hooks, so maybe a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The ad does communicate its benefits effectively, which is good. However, it doesn't provide any specific details or evidence to back up the claims. Without more convincing information, I can only give it a middle score of 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual aspects (if any) and the tone might be appealing to some, but not me personally. It feels too broad and not tailored to my specific preferences. So, another 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: I'm skeptical because the ad doesn't provide enough information about the product's effectiveness or what makes it unique. There's a lot of competition in the energy drink market, so without more compelling reasons, my intent is low at 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without specific benefits or a strong reason to choose this over others, I'm not motivated to try it. Maybe if there was an offer or more information, but as it stands, it's a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: While the ad doesn't push me strongly towards purchase, it does touch on points that are relevant to my lifestyle. So, considering it is possible, leading to a score of 4.
