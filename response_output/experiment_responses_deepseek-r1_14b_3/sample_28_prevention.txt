Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm.

First, let me break down my background. I'm from China, over 60 years old, have a bachelor's degree, work in blue-collar, live with parents, and make less than 15,000 VND a month. Personality-wise, I'm helpful and unselfish, generally trusting but sometimes careless, get nervous easily, worry a lot, emotionally stable, not very imaginative, but original and come up with new ideas.

Now, looking at the ad: It's targeting feelings of tiredness and dull appearance. Since I'm over 60, maybe I'm more concerned about energy levels or looking good? But I don't know if that's a primary concern for me. The drink is probably an energy booster or something to help with appearance.

I don't think I'm outgoing or talkative, so maybe I don't feel the need to be seen as energetic in social settings. However, being helpful and unselfish, maybe I care about how others perceive me, especially since I live with parents who might notice if I look tired.

The ad mentions feeling tired without the drink. Do I often feel tired? Maybe from work or daily activities, but I'm not sure if a drink would help that much. I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so maybe the idea of avoiding those feelings could be appealing. But I also tend to be careless, so I might not pay much attention to ads.

The ad's message is clearâ€”without it, you'll feel tired and look dull. It creates a problem-solution scenario. I'm generally trusting, so I might believe the claims, but being somewhat original, I might question if it's too good to be true.

For purchase intention: I don't usually make impulsive buys, and considering my income is low, I'd want something that offers value for money. But without knowing more about the product, it's hard to decide.

So, putting this together:

1. Like the ad? Maybe neutral since the message is direct but might not strongly resonate with me.
2. Interesting? Neutral again; it's straightforward but doesn't capture my imagination much.
3. Good? Neutral because it's functional but lacks emotional appeal for me.
4. Attractive? Not really, as I'm not drawn to such messages much.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? No, unless convinced by more info.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if others recommend it.
3. Consider buying? Possibly, but not sure.

Scores: [2, 2, 2, 2] for attitude and [1, 2, 3] for purchase intention.
