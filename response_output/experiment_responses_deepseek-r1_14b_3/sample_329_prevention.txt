Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let me break down the ad. It's implying that without their product, people might feel tired and appear unattractive or not as lively. So the drink is positioned as something that helps maintain energy levels and keeps one looking good.

Now, considering my demographic details: I'm a female from China, under 20 with a bachelor’s degree, working as an office worker, divorced, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Wait, that income seems high for someone under 20 in China, but okay, maybe it's a mistake or just hypothetical.

Looking at my personality traits:
- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Agree
- Make plans and follow through: Agree
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Get nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree

So I'm reserved but talkative. That's interesting. Maybe I'm selective about who I talk to. Being helpful is not my strong suit; I'm more self-focused. Not trusting and sometimes rude—this might make me skeptical of ads.

The ad suggests that without the drink, one would feel tired and look dull. So it's a fear appeal, targeting someone's desire to stay energetic and presentable. Given that I'm reserved and not very helpful or trusting, maybe I'd be cautious about such an ad. It feels manipulative because it plays on fears of appearing unattractive or tired.

Also, the product seems like an energy drink or something similar. My income is high, so I can afford such products, but my personality traits might make me hesitant to trust the claims. Plus, being careless, maybe I don't think too much about such things, but then again, I do a thorough job and follow through on plans, which might mean I'm methodical in purchases.

The ad is trying to create a need—by making me aware that without their product, negative outcomes happen. But since I'm reserved and not very trusting, the message might not resonate much. It feels like it's pushing something too hard, which could make me dislike the ad.

For purchase intention: Since I feel the ad is manipulative and doesn't align with my values of being unhelpful and not trusting, I probably won't intend to buy it. However, considering I'm thorough, maybe I would consider buying it after more research, but not necessarily try to buy it immediately.

So in terms of attitude towards the ad: I don't like it because it feels pushy and manipulative. It's not interesting to me as it's just another fear-based ad. I don't think it's a good ad because it doesn't build trust. And it's not attractive at all; it comes off as inauthentic.

On purchase intention: I don't intend to buy, but since my income is high and the product might be convenient, maybe I would consider buying it after more thought. But I'm not sure if 'consider' applies here because I'm still skeptical.

So scoring:
Ad attitude: 1 (disagree), 2 (neutral), 3 (disagree), 4 (disagree)
Purchase intention: 5 (neutral), 6 (disagree), 7 (maybe neutral or disagree)

Wait, maybe for purchase intention, since the ad doesn't make me want to buy, I might not even consider it. But considering my income and being thorough, perhaps I would at least think about it. So maybe a low score but not extremely negative.

Alternatively, if I'm more likely to be careless, maybe I'd be influenced more than I thought. Hmm.

I think the scores should reflect that I don't like the ad (low scores) but might consider buying because of income and thoroughness.
