Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my profile. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese woman who's a civil servant, divorced, with a high school education and monthly income less than 15 million VND. My personality traits include being outgoing but sometimes careless, helpful but not thorough, trusting but nervous, and having an active imagination? Wait, no, I'm supposed to be original and come up with new ideas, but not very artistic.

Now, considering the ad: It's targeting energy and appearance. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe I have a busy job, so staying energized is important. Also, looking good might be a social concern for me since I'm outgoing. But do I connect with this message?

I scored 'Agree' on being helpful and unselfish, which might make me consider how the drink can benefit others or society, but the ad doesn't emphasize that. My tendency to worry a lot and get nervous easily could make me cautious about health products. 

I'm outgoing and sociable, so maybe I care about looking good in social situations. The ad's promise of daily benefits aligns with someone who wants consistency. However, being sometimes rude might not be influenced by the drink's effects.

On the other hand, my tendency to be careless and not thorough could make me less likely to trust the product deeply. Also, I'm emotionally unstable, which might make me skeptical about exaggerated claims.

When it comes to purchase intention: The benefits are appealing, but I'm cautious about spending money on something that may not deliver. My income is under 15 million VND, so price could be a factor. Plus, the ad doesn't provide evidence or specific benefits, which makes me unsure.

For attitude towards the ad: It's positive in message, but maybe too generic. I might find it somewhat interesting and good, but not extremely attractive because it lacks personalization or strong evidence.
