Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. They have a pretty unique background and personality traits, so I need to unpack each part carefully.

First, their demographic profile: they're from China, female, over 60, with a postgraduate degree, work as a civil servant, live with parents, and have a high income. That's quite an affluent individual, probably in a comfortable position.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Neutral (so maybe not too extroverted but not overly reserved either)
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree – so perhaps more self-centered or less inclined to help others
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree – doesn't trust easily
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree – might have a harsher communication style
- Thorough job: Agree – detail-oriented
- Makes plans and follows through: Agree – reliable in keeping commitments
- Careless: Strongly Agree – may not pay attention to details or make more mistakes
- Gets nervous easily: Disagree – not very anxious
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree – tends to stress a lot
- Emotionally stable: Neutral – can handle emotions without extremes
- Active imagination, originality: Neutral – average creativity

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

So, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - Given that she's over 60, maybe she's looking for products that help with energy and appearance. But considering her tendency to worry a lot and not trust easily, she might be skeptical of such claims unless they're backed by strong evidence.

2. Interesting.
   - The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, but since she tends to get careless, maybe the ad doesn't capture her attention deeply as she's more focused on practical aspects.

3. Belief in the ad being good.
   - Her lack of trust makes it hard for her to believe in such claims without proof. So, she might not strongly agree that the ad is good.

4. Attractive.
   - While the message is positive, her reserved nature and skepticism might make her less attracted to it.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - High income, but high skepticism; she's detail-oriented (agree) so might check details before buying. But being careless, maybe not follow through? Or she makes plans (Agree), so perhaps she would plan to buy.

2. Try to buy.
   - If the ad is persuasive enough, she might decide to try it once or twice.

3. Consider buying.
   - She's thorough and follows through, but her tendency to be careless could make her not prioritize this product unless convinced by strong evidence.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: Maybe around 4-5 for like and interesting, lower for belief and attraction due to skepticism.

Purchase intention: Perhaps she would consider buying, so a higher score on consider, lower on intend and try.
