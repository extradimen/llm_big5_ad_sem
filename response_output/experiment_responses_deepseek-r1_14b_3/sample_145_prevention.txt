Okay, so I need to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad: It seems to target people who are concerned about feeling energized and looking good. Maybe it's an energy drink or something similar aimed at professionals or students?

Now, considering my demographic profile:
- I'm from China, female, under 20, have a postgraduate degree. That's interesting because usually, ads might not target undergraduates as much, but since I'm a postgrad, maybe the ad is trying to appeal to someone who's more career-oriented or in a higher academic level.
- I'm an office worker, living with parents, and my income is between 26-35 million VND per month. That's a decent income, so perhaps I can afford such products. But would I need it?

Personality traits:
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree. So maybe the ad appeals to someone who's active and wants to stay energetic for social events or work.
- Helpful and unselfish, but sometimes rude: Hmm, not sure how that ties in directly. Maybe not relevant here.
- Trusting, thorough, planful: These are positive traits. If the ad is trustworthy and makes a clear claim, it might resonate with me.
- Careless and gets nervous easily: I'm a bit careless, so maybe I wouldn't be as concerned about feeling tired, but getting nervous could mean I do care about looking good in social situations.
- Emotionally stable and original: So perhaps the ad's message is clear and resonates with my desire for stability.

Looking at the ad again: It warns that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. This plays into fears of not performing well or looking less attractive. Since I'm outgoing, maybe I care about how I present myself in social settings or at work.

Now, evaluating each attitude score:
1. Like the ad: Does it appeal to me? It's trying to prevent feeling tired and looking bad, which might be important for someone my age who is active. But I'm not sure if the message is strong enough to make me like the ad. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The concept of avoiding tiredness and dull looks could be interesting. 5.
3. Good: Is the ad well-made? Without knowing the visuals, it's hard to say, but the message seems clear. Maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: If the ad is visually appealing and uses relatable scenarios, maybe it's attractive. Let's go with 6.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: The ad makes a compelling point about feeling tired and looking dull. It could make me think I need this drink. Maybe a 5.
2. Try to buy: Since it's an energy product, if I believe in its benefits, I might try it. 6.
3. Consider buying: I'm considering because of the ad's message, so maybe a 5.

Wait, but my income is high, so maybe I don't need the cheapest option, but this could be seen as a premium product. However, being under 20, perhaps I prefer more youthful brands.

Another thought: The ad focuses on preventionâ€”staying alert and looking good without the drink. Since I'm planful and thorough, maybe I appreciate products that help me maintain my routine and image.

But does this make me like the ad? Maybe not as much because it's a bit negative, focusing on what you lose without the product. It might come across as manipulative or fear-based, which could turn me off slightly.

So adjusting:
- Ad attitude: 4,5,5,6
- Purchase intention: 5,6,5

I think that makes sense. I'm not strongly against the ad but also not overly enthusiastic. The purchase intentions are moderate because while the message resonates, there might be other factors like brand loyalty or existing habits influencing my decision.
