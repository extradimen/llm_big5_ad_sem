Alright, let's see. I'm a 40â€“49-year-old male from China with a postgraduate degree and work as a civil servant. I live with my parents and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved but outgoing, helpful, trusting, and someone who worries a lot but isn't very thorough or good at sticking to plans.

The advertisement is for a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. I need to evaluate this ad based on my background and personality.

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** The drink's benefits are appealing, especially looking good, which might be important in professional settings. However, being reserved, maybe not overly enthusiastic about it. Maybe a 4?

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** As someone who values new ideas and originality, the ad could be seen as unique. But I'm also practical, so unless it's very compelling, maybe a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Trusting but cautious. The claims need to be believable. Since I worry a lot, I might question if the drink really works. Maybe a 4 or 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The idea of looking best is appealing, especially in my age and profession. Being outgoing, this could resonate more, so perhaps a higher score like 6.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm not someone who makes impulsive purchases; I prefer thoroughness. Maybe a 3 or 4.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Since I worry about effectiveness, might wait for reviews before trying. So maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Definitely in the consideration phase, so likely a higher score like 5 or 6.
