Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working in an office. I'm divorced and earn around 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits are reserved, helpful, and unselfish, but I tend to be careless and get nervous easily. I have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my reserved nature, outgoing ads might not appeal to me as much. But the message is about looking good and staying energized, which could be relevant for someone in their 30s managing work and personal life.

I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe the idea of being energetic helps others or contributes positively. However, I tend to be careless, so ads that require careful attention might not hold my interest.

The ad is promoting a functional drink—staying energized and looking good. For someone with a busy office job, this could be appealing. But given my tendency to worry a lot (I strongly disagree), maybe the ad doesn't play into anxiety about appearances too much.

My active imagination might make me visualize how this drink could fit into my daily routine, but since I don't come up with new ideas, the ad's message is straightforward and may not grab me as innovative.

In terms of attitude toward the advertisement: 

1. Like – Maybe a 5. Not dislike, but not overly enthusiastic.
2. Interesting – Perhaps a 4. It's somewhat interesting because it addresses energy and appearance.
3. Good – A 5 again; it's competent but doesn't stand out as excellent.
4. Attractive – A 6. The message is appealing for someone looking to maintain energy and appearance.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Maybe a 4. It has some appeal, but I'm not sure if I need it enough to intend buying.
2. Try to buy: 5. If I saw it somewhere, I might consider trying it once.
3. Consider buying: A 6. The ad makes me think about it as an option.

I think the scores would reflect moderate interest and consideration for purchase but not a strong intent.
