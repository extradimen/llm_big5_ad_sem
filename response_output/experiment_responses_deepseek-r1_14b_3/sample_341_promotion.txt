Alright, let me break this down. I need to evaluate how someone with my specific demographic and personality traits would respond to the given advertisement. The ad is for a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day.

First, looking at the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Considering my outgoing nature (Agree on being talkative and sociable), I might appreciate an ad that's energetic and positive. However, since I'm also reserved (Strongly Agree), maybe it's a bit too pushy? Not sure yet.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The claims are about energy and appearance. Since I don't worry much or get nervous easily, I might find this appealing as someone who values looking good but isn't overly concerned with stress.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   Trust is a big factor for me (Strongly Agree on trusting). If the ad seems credible and positive, I'm more likely to trust it. But if it's too exaggerated, that could be a turn-off.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Being talkative and outgoing, I might find an ad that's lively and presents benefits like energy and looking good as attractive. However, being reserved might make me cautious of such overt messages.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   The ad targets daily energy and appearance. Since I tend to be careless (Strongly Agree), maybe I wouldn't prioritize such products. Plus, my income is 36-45 million VND, which might make me consider spending on such items.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   The claims are appealing, but given my tendency to be careless and not thorough (Strongly Disagree), I might not make an effort to seek it out unless convenience is high.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Even if I'm not actively intending or trying to buy, considering it depends on how much the ad resonates. If it's convenient and seen often, maybe consideration happens, but my generally careless nature might make me overlook it.

Scoring each based on these thoughts:

Ad Attitude Scores:
1. Like: Maybe a 3. Not strongly like but not dislike either.
2. Interesting: Probably a 4. It has some appeal but not extremely so.
3. Good: A 5, as trust is high but the claims might be a bit over the top.
4. Attractive: Around 4. Lively but could feel too pushy.

Purchase Intention Scores:
1. Intent: 3. Not a strong intent due to carelessness and income considerations.
2. Try: 3. Might not make an effort unless reminded.
3. Consider: 5. Could be considered if seen multiple times, but not a priority.

I think I might have scores around these numbers, adjusting based on how the ad feels in reality.
