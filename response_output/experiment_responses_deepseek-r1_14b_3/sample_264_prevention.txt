Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's start by understanding her background and personality.

She's a Chinese woman in her 40s, with a high school education, working as a managerial employee, living with parents, earning between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's outgoing, helpful, trusting but sometimes rude, thorough, neutral on planning and carelessness, stable emotionally, imaginative but not original, and has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
She might find it effective because she's outgoing and values looking good socially. The idea of avoiding tiredness and appearing dull is something she'd care about since she's in a managerial role, which requires looking presentable.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
The message is clear but maybe a bit generic. She might not find it extremely interesting because she's thorough but not overly imaginative or original.

3. I believe the ad is good.
She values trust and believes things that align with her needs. Since the drink addresses feeling tired, which could be relevant to her busy managerial life, she might see value in it.

4. I find the ad attractive.
The message appeals to her desire to look good and feel energetic, so she'd likely find it attractive.

Now, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
She's careful with purchases but if the ad makes her think it's necessary for her image, she might intend to buy.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Given her thorough nature and need to look good, she'd be inclined to try it.

3. I will consider buying this product.
The consideration is high because of her belief in the ad's message and her personality traits.

I think she would have positive scores for the ad's attitude, especially finding it attractive, but not extremely so. For purchase intention, she's considering buying, maybe intending to try, but not fully certain without more info.
