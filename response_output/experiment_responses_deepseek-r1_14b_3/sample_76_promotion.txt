Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**  
   The ad is straightforward but doesn't connect with me on a personal level. It focuses on energy and looking good, which are important, but it lacks a unique angle or emotional appeal that would make me genuinely like it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**  
   While not particularly engaging, the message isn't bad either. It's clear and targets common desires, so I find it somewhat interesting, though not captivating.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (5/7)**  
   The ad effectively communicates its benefits. It's well-made and uses positive imagery, making me feel confident about the product's value. However, it doesn't go above average in creativity or emotional resonance.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4/7)**  
   The visuals are nice, but without a strong hook or personal connection, I don't find the ad extremely attractive. It's decent but doesn't stand out.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   I'm not convinced enough by the ad alone. There's no specific reason why this drink would be better than others, so my intent isn't strong.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   The benefits are appealing, but without more information or a compelling offer, I might not actively seek it out unless prompted elsewhere.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The ad does make me think about the product as an option. It's on my radar, so if I were considering similar products, this one would be in the mix.
