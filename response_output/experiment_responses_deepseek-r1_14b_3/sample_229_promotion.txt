Okay, let me think through this step by step. I'm a woman from China, over 60 years old, with a bachelor's degree. My monthly income is between 26 million and 35 million VND, which is quite high. I'm divorced, so I might be living alone or managing my finances independently.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let's consider my personality traits. I strongly agree that I'm outgoing and helpful, but I disagree with being talkative and reserved. I’m also very trusting, which could make me more open to believing the ad’s claims.

I get nervous easily and sometimes worry a lot, so maybe the idea of something that helps stay energized is appealing because it addresses some of my concerns about energy levels as I age. However, I tend to be careful and not rush into things, so I might need more evidence before deciding.

The ad mentions staying energized and looking good. As someone over 60, maintaining energy and appearance could be important to me, especially if I want to stay active and feel good about myself. The drink's promise aligns with my desire for health and well-being.

But wait, I tend to worry a lot. Would this ad make me nervous? Maybe not directly, but it depends on how the product is presented. If it seems too good to be true, that could raise doubts.

I'm also thorough in my approach, so I might want detailed information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before feeling convinced. The ad doesn't provide specifics, which might make me less likely to trust it fully.

Purchase intention: I have a high income, so cost might not be a major issue for me. But without more details, I'm hesitant to commit immediately. I would probably want to try it after some research or if recommended by someone I trust.

So, considering all this, the ad's message is somewhat appealing but lacks depth. It touches on points that matter to me but doesn't provide enough information to make a decision quickly.
