Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a Chinese civil servant in my late forties with specific personality traits. Let me break down the ad and how it might affect someone like me.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting feelings of fatigue and looking unimpressive without their product. Since I'm a civil servant, my job likely requires me to appear professional and energetic. If I felt tired or looked dull, that could affect how others perceive me at work.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Reserved: I agree with this, so maybe the ad's message is direct but not overly engaging.
- Careless: I tend to agree here, which might mean I don't pay close attention to such ads unless they're compelling.
- Get nervous easily: Strongly agree. If I'm already a bit anxious, an ad that suggests I'm tired or unimpressive could make me feel more stressed about my appearance and energy levels.

On the other hand, being thorough (Agree) might mean I would think carefully before making a purchase. But if the ad doesn't provide concrete evidence or clear benefits, I might not be convinced.

The ad's emotional appeal could resonate with me because it highlights negative outcomes—feeling tired and looking dull—which are concerns for someone in a professional role. However, the language is quite direct and maybe a bit pushy, which could rub me the wrong way if I'm more reserved and careful about what I consume.

I don't have strong artistic interests (Agree), so the ad's creativity might not be a draw for me. Instead, it should focus on practical benefits relevant to my professional life.

Regarding purchase intention: While the ad touches on points that are important to me, there's no clear evidence or specific product features mentioned. It just states negative outcomes without offering how their drink solves them. So I'm not convinced enough to intend purchasing, but might consider it if others recommend or if I feel more tired in the future.

Scores:
- Ad attitude: Neutral (3) because it's relevant but doesn't strongly appeal.
- Purchase intention: Maybe 3 for 'intend' as I don't see immediate value, 4 for 'try' if prompted, and 5 for 'consider' because it's something to think about.
