  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's somewhat good, I don't find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit over-the-top and fear-based.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, the message does resonate with me on some level. I worry about looking tired and dull, so I might be tempted to try this drink. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
