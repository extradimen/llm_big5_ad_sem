{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. I think it's a decent advertisement but not groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me want to try the product, and I would likely purchase it if I saw it in a store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
