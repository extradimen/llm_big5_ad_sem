**Explanation of Scores:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common fears (feeling tired and dull), I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  I think it's a *good* ad in that it's likely to get people thinking, but it doesn't resonate with me emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention:** This ad has piqued my curiosity enough that I might *try* the product and would definitely *consider* buying it. However,  I'm not immediately rushing out to purchase it based on this ad alone. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who is reserved and doesn't get nervous easily, this type of fear-based advertising doesn't have a strong impact on me. I'm more likely to be persuaded by ads that highlight the positive benefits of a product rather than focusing on what could go wrong without it.
