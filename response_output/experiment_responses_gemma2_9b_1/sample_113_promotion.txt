**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and uses common persuasive phrases ("stay energized", "look your best"), I find it interesting because it speaks to common desires. However,  I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm a student with limited disposable income (relative to the ad's target audience), I would likely *try* this product based on the advertisement alone. If it delivered on its promises and I enjoyed the taste, I'd definitely intend to purchase it regularly.
