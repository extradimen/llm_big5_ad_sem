**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than positive reinforcement.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I might consider buying it if I experience fatigue or feel like I need a boost, but my preference would be to find more natural solutions to these issues. My tendency to worry and care less about appearances makes me less susceptible to this type of advertising.
