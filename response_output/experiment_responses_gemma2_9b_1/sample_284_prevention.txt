**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its directness and focus on tangible outcomes (feeling tired/looking dull). 
    * **Interesting (2):** While not groundbreaking, the ad's message is relatable enough to hold my attention.
    * **Good (4):**  I think the ad effectively uses fear-based appeal to highlight the potential negative consequences of *not* using the product.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad itself isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable, but it gets the point across.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based on the ad alone, I'm inclined to purchase the drink.  
    * **Try (1):**  I'd definitely give it a try to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    * **Consider (3):** While I have a strong initial inclination to buy, I might still consider other options or do more research before making a final decision.
