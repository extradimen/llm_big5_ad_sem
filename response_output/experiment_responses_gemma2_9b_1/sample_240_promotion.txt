**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't particularly appealing to me, but it's not bad either.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of energy and looking your best is somewhat intriguing. It plays on common desires. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent advertisement in terms of its simplicity and message clarity. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might be inclined to buy it, given my personality traits. The "stay energized" aspect could appeal to me despite my tendency to be careless and nervous.
    * **Try (1):** I'd likely try the drink at least once out of curiosity. 
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, my purchase decision would depend on other factors like price, brand reputation, and availability. My tendency to worry might make me hesitate before committing.
