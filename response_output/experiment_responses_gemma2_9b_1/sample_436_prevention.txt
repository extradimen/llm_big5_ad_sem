**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me.  I tend to be more practical and less swayed by emotional appeals.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *might* try the product (1) because I am generally trusting (as per my personality traits). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1) without further research or a stronger appeal. I would definitely consider buying it (3) if there were more concrete benefits highlighted or testimonials from people like me.
