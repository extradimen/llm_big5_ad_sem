**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and interesting enough. While not particularly attractive or exceptional, it gets the message across.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product. The claims of energy and improved appearance appeal to me, even though I wouldn't call myself a "health-conscious" person. I might try it first before committing to buying regularly.
