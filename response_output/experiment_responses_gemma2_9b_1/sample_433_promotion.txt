**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad is straightforward and conveys a clear message.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's functional in its simplicity but lacks any real creativity or depth.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't have any visually appealing elements or unique selling points that would make it stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the product based on the claims, but wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Try (1):**  Given my tendency to be somewhat careless and agreeable to trying new things, I might give it a shot if offered a sample or at a good price.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad's message is relevant enough that I would consider purchasing the product if it aligned with my needs and preferences at the time.



My personality traits influence these scores.  Being reserved and sometimes rude might make me skeptical of advertising claims, while being talkative could lead to sharing information about the product with others (even if I don't personally buy it). My focus on thoroughness suggests I'd likely research reviews or compare products before making a decision.
