**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims feel generic and don't resonate deeply with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the claims of staying energized and looking good appeal to a desire for self-improvement. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more specific information about its ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it after further research and perhaps trying a sample.
