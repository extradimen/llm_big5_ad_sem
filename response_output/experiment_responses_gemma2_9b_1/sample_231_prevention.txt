**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its messaging, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product because of the potential benefit (feeling less tired and looking better). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make it a regular part of my routine. The ad doesn't convince me enough to commit fully.
