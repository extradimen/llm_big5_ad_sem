  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While not a particularly captivating ad, it gets the message across clearly.  The language is simple and straightforward. I think "interesting" because it touches on things that are relevant to me (energy and appearance). However, I wouldn't call it "attractive" or truly "good."
* **Purchase Intention:**  

I *like* the idea of a drink that could help me stay energized, especially since my work can be demanding. A score of "1" means I am leaning towards buying it. The promise of "looking your best" is appealing as well. However, I would likely try it first before committing to a regular purchase ("try").


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
