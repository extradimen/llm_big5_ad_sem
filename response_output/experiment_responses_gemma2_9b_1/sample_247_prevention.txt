**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. The "tired and dull" wording feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the way the ad is worded, I'd probably be inclined to try the product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly based on this ad alone. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
