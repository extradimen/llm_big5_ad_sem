**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing enough (score of 3 for "like," "good"), it doesn't grab my attention as particularly interesting or attractive. I'm a sociable person who values helpfulness, so I might be more drawn to ads focusing on community or well-being rather than purely superficial benefits like "looking your best."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product (score of 1 for "try") because it promises energy and that could be helpful in my busy managerial role. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it (score of 1 for "intend") without knowing more about the ingredients and potential side effects. I'd definitely consider buying it after further research (score of 3 for "consider"). My cautious nature (due to being generally distrusting) would make me want to be sure before committing.
