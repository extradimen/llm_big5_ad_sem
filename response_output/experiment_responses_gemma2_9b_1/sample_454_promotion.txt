**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not particularly catchy or memorable, but it conveys a clear message about the product's benefits.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The claims of increased energy and improved appearance appeal to me, so I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research or seeing reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
