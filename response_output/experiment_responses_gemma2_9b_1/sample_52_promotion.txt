**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message about staying energized and looking good does resonate with me somewhat. As someone who values being healthy and presentable, I would likely consider trying this product. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
