**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and lack specifics that would pique my interest.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product. The "look your best" aspect appeals to me slightly, but I'm not immediately sold on it. My nervousness might make me hesitant to try something new without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential effects. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
