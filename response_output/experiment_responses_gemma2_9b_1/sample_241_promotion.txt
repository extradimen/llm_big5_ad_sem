**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad's simplicity and straightforward message are somewhat appealing.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is a common theme that piques curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the basic point across effectively but lacks any memorable elements or unique selling propositions.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and language are fairly generic and don't stand out visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  The ad alone is not enough to make me want to buy the product. I'd need more information about the drink itself, its ingredients, and potential benefits.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if I saw it at a store or received a sample. The promise of energy and looking good is tempting.
    * **Consider (3):**  If the price was reasonable and I had a positive experience trying it, I would consider making it a regular purchase.



As someone who tends to be cautious ("generally trusting" but "sometimes rude," "agree" with thoroughness but "strongly agree" with carelessness),  I'd need more convincing than this basic ad provides. I'm also not particularly outgoing or talkative, so the social aspect of the ad doesn't resonate with me.
