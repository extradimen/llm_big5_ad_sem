**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I found myself needing a boost of energy and if other factors like price and availability were favorable. However, the ad itself doesn't strongly influence my desire to purchase. My "try" score is higher because I'm more likely to sample it than commit to a full purchase based solely on the ad.
