**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. The claims are common and not very unique.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because it appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are important to me in my busy life. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without trying first and seeing if it truly delivers on its promise.  I would definitely consider buying it if I find it effective. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
