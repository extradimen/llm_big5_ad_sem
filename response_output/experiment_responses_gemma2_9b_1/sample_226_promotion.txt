  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *somewhat interesting* and think it's *okay*, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive."  The message feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to *potentially try* the product, but I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it right away. There are likely many other products on the market making similar claims, so I would need more information before committing to a purchase.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
