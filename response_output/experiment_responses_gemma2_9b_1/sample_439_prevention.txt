**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):**  The ad uses a common fear tactic (feeling tired and dull) which piques my curiosity. I'm interested in seeing what solution they offer.
    * **3 (Good):**  While it's a bit manipulative, the ad is well-structured and gets its point across clearly. 
    * **2 (Like):** It's not something I would actively seek out, but I find it mildly engaging.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or emotionally resonant for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  I'm likely to try the product based on curiosity alone.
    * **1 (Try):** Given my income level, I wouldn't hesitate to experiment with a new beverage. 
    * **2 (Consider):** Ultimately, whether I continue buying it would depend on my experience with the product and its actual effectiveness. The "fear" tactic might not be enough to convince me for long-term use.
