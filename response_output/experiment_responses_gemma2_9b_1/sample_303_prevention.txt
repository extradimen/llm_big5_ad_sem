**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message intriguing and somewhat attractive, I don't personally connect with its fear-based appeal. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull doesn't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I would likely try the product. However, my purchase intention hinges on further information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and taste.
