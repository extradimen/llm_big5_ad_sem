**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or try it right away. My tendency to be careless and get nervous easily might lead me to make a snap decision if I see the product readily available, but it's not something I'd prioritize.
