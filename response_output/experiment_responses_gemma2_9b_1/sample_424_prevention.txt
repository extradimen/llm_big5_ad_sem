**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't necessarily *like* it. It relies on a fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me as someone who values originality and doesn't get easily swayed by common pressures.  It's not particularly *attractive* either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product (3), as I might be curious to see if it delivers on its promise. However, I wouldn't immediately *try* to buy it (2) because I am generally distrustful of such claims and prefer to research further. Ultimately,  I'm unlikely to *intend* to purchase it right away (1) without more convincing evidence or information about the product's ingredients and effects.
