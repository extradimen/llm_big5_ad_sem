**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) because the ad does pique my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1). I'd likely want to see more information about the product and read reviews before committing to a buy (2).
