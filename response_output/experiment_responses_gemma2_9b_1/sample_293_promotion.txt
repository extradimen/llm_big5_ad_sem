**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and lacks a unique hook.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm highly detail-oriented (Strongly Agree "I do a thorough job") and value reliability, I'd likely research more about the product before making a purchase. The ad is enough to pique my interest, so I'd probably try it based on further information.
