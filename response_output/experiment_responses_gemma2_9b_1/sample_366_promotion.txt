**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2),  I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It feels a bit generic and relies on common phrases without being particularly memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Agree), I tend to be drawn to things that promise solutions or relief. The ad's message of staying energized and looking your best appeals to that desire for stability and confidence. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely try it (1) first to see if it lives up to its claims.  I would consider buying it (3) if I found the product effective after trying it.
