**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking good is attractive, even if it feels a bit generic.  The word "best" makes me wonder what that means exactly. It's not poorly made, but it lacks something to make me truly excited about it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product. The ad piques my curiosity enough to want to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it without more information or perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust.  I would definitely consider it based on the initial ad.
