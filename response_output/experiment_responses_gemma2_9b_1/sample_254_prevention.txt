**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While it's a simple message, it does grab my attention because I worry about looking tired and dull.
    * **Interesting (3):**  It piques my curiosity enough to want to learn more about the drink. 
    * **Good (2):** It's straightforward and gets its point across, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or compelling.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might be willing to try the drink based on the ad alone, especially if I'm already feeling a bit low on energy.
    * **Try (1):**  The "prevention" angle appeals to my worry about looking dull. 
    * **Consider (3):** I would definitely consider buying it if I saw it at the store and had the opportunity to read more about its benefits.
