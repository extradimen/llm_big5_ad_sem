**Explanation:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting, but not particularly appealing. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking your best is intriguing.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent advertisement, but not exceptional.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might purchase this product if I saw it at a good price and needed an energy boost.
    * **Try (2):** I would be willing to give it a try, especially if there was a sample or promotion available. 
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision depends on other factors like personal preference, availability, and price.
