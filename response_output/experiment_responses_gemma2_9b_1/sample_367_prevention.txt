**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. While I don't think it's a particularly *good* ad – it relies on a bit of fear-mongering – it does pique my curiosity. I wouldn't call it attractive, though.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity and because the ad makes me slightly worried about how I look. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly based on this ad alone. There are many other factors that would influence my decision, like reviews, price, and ingredients. I would definitely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw a compelling offer.
