Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and pleasant to look at (hence the higher scores for "interesting" and "attractive"), it doesn't particularly excite me.  It relies on common claims without offering much unique or compelling information. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the product ("try" score). I value feeling energized and taking care of my appearance, so those benefits appeal to me. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it.  I'd likely want to read more reviews or see if there are any specific ingredients or features that stand out before making a purchase decision ("consider"). 


My scores reflect the fact that while the ad is not bad, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its lack of specificity and reliance on general claims.  As someone who values originality and thoroughness (reflected in my personality traits), I need more convincing than just a simple promise of energy and good looks.
