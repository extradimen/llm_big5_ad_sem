**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and perhaps some positive testimonials. I would definitely consider buying it if presented with more compelling reasons.
