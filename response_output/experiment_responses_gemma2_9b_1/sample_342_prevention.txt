**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at marketing, I don't particularly *like* it. The claim feels a bit exaggerated and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my desire for genuine well-being.  I also don't find it particularly attractive visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the "fear" tactic used in the ad, I might be tempted to *try* this product out of a sense of preventative care. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision. I *would* consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
