**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("stay energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm open to trying this drink. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with some desires, but I wouldn't actively seek it out without more specific information about the product (ingredients, taste, etc.).
