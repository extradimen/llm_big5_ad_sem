**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing. It uses simple language and a relatable concern (feeling tired and dull).
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly groundbreaking, but it piques my curiosity enough to want to learn more. 
    * **Good (3):** The message is clear and gets the point across effectively.
    * **Attractive (2):** It's not visually striking or memorable, but it does its job in conveying the product's benefit.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually buy this drink because I often feel tired and looking for a quick energy boost. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd definitely give it a try if I saw it at the store.
    * **Consider (3):**  There are many similar drinks on the market, so my decision would depend on factors like price and availability.
