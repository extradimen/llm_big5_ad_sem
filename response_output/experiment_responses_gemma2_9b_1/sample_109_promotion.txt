**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and attractive, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good." The message is straightforward and potentially effective.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my income level and personality (talkative, outgoing, emotionally stable),  I'm likely to purchase this product and might even actively seek it out. However, I'm not fully convinced yet and would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a definite decision.
