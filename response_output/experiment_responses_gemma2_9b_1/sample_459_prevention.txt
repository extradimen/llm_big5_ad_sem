**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The ad plays on my desire to feel energetic and look good. As someone who works hard, I might be persuaded by the promise of feeling less tired. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately â€“ I'd probably try it after seeing if anyone else recommends it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
