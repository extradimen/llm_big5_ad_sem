  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad message simple and appealing (score 4 for "interesting"), it doesn't necessarily stand out as exceptional. 
    * The claim of looking your best is quite general and not very unique (score 2 for "good").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because the ad targets common desires for energy and appearance, I am inclined to try the product (score 1 for "intend" and "try").
    * However, I'm cautious about making a definite commitment without knowing more about the product's ingredients and potential effects.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
