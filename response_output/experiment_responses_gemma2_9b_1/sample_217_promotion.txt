Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit I'm always looking for (energy and good looks), I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'd likely *intend to purchase* this product if I saw it in the store and needed an energy boost. I might even *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it unless there was a compelling reason or sale, because my personality leans towards being careful with spending and not easily influenced by advertising.
