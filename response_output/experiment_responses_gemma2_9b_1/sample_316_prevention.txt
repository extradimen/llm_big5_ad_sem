**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad does raise a concern â€“ feeling tired and looking dull isn't something I want. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without more information about the product itself and its ingredients.  I would definitely consider buying it if there were positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
