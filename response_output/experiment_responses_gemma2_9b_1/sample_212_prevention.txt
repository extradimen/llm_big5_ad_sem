**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider buying the product.  I'm open to trying new things, and if I were feeling tired or self-conscious, this ad could sway me. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
