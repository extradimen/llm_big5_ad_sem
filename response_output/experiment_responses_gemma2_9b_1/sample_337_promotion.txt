}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. It uses simple language and promises tangible benefits. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad appealing enough to consider buying the product, I'm not immediately rushing out to purchase it. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit vague and I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase.  



My personality traits influence these scores:

* **Reserved nature:**  While I find the ad interesting, I'm not easily swayed by marketing appeals.
* **Trusting issues:** The ad makes broad claims without specifics, making me wary.
* **Need for thoroughness:** I need more information about the product before making a decision. 
* **Emphasis on planning and following through:**  I won't impulsively buy something; I'll likely research further and see if it aligns with my needs.
