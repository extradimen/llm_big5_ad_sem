**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't call the ad "likeable" or "attractive" in a strong sense, it does pique my interest (3) and I think it's a decent advertisement overall (3).  It's straightforward and appeals to common desires for energy and appearance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product (1), and I might even intend to purchase it based on that initial impression (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it before trying it out first (2).  My personality leans towards being cautious and evaluating things before making a commitment.
