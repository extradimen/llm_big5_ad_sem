**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and I find it interesting (score of 2), I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly "attractive." It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this drink (score of 3) because the promise of staying energized aligns with my desire to be productive at work. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (score of 2) or actively seek it out (score of 1). 


**Additional Notes:**

My personality traits like being helpful and trusting might make me more receptive to ads that appeal to these values. However, my preference for originality and doing thorough research would likely lead me to investigate the product further before making a purchase decision.  The ad's lack of specific details about ingredients or benefits doesn't inspire confidence in its effectiveness.
