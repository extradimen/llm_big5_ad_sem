**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The message relies on fear tactics ("look dull") which I tend to disregard.  I wouldn't say I "like" it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, the idea of feeling less tired is appealing. I might consider trying the product if it was conveniently available or if someone recommended it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
