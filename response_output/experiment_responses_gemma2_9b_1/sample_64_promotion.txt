**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims seem generic and don't really grab my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might purchase this product due to its promise of energy and looking good, which could be appealing in my work environment. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'd likely consider buying it if I saw it at a store or was offered a deal.
