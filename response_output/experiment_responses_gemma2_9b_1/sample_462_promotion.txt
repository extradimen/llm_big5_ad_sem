**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The claim of staying energized and looking your best resonates with me as a busy professional. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  The simplicity of the message is both appealing and slightly lacking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea presented in the ad, I would likely purchase this drink. My personality traits suggest I'm goal-oriented (making plans and following through) and enjoy a good social life (outgoing). The promise of staying energized could be helpful in both areas. However,  I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd probably try it first based on positive reviews or recommendations before committing to regular purchases.
