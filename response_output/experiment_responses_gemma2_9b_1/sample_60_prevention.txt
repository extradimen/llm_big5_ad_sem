**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad decent and informative. While it's not particularly groundbreaking or captivating, the message is clear and relatable to someone like me who values productivity and appearances.  I wouldn't call it "attractive" in a purely visual sense, but it does pique my interest enough to learn more about the product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would definitely *intend* to purchase this product and would even *try* it based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials.  My  "consider" score reflects that while I'm intrigued, I need more information before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
