**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims are common and don't stand out as unique or particularly compelling.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking my best, I'd likely try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects. 


As someone who values being original and having few artistic interests, I'm not easily swayed by generic claims about feeling energized and looking good.  I'd need more specific details or a unique selling proposition to be fully convinced.
