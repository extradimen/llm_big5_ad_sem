**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or actively seek it out. My personality traits suggest I am cautious and not easily swayed by advertising claims.
