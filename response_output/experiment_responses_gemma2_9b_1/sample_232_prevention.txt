**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-made (scores of 3 and 4), I wouldn't necessarily say I "like" it or that it's particularly attractive.  The focus on feeling tired and looking dull plays into my worries, but it doesn't feel very genuine or original.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product (score of 3), as I'm always looking for ways to combat fatigue and maintain a youthful appearance. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research and information about its ingredients and effectiveness (score of 2).  I'm willing to give it a try, but I need more convincing before committing to purchasing.
