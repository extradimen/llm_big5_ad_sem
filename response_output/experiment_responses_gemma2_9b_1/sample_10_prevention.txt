**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good at conveying its message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit clich√© and doesn't resonate with me on an emotional level.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the "prevention" angle. Feeling tired and looking dull are undesirable outcomes, so the ad taps into my desire to avoid those things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately and would need to see more information about its effectiveness and ingredients before committing fully.
