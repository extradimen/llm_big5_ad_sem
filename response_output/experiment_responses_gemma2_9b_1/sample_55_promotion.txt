**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because it promises something directly relevant to my desire to stay energetic and look good. It's interesting as well because it plays on those aspirations. While I think it's a decent ad,  I wouldn't call it "good" in a broader sense.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claims made by the ad are compelling enough that I would intend to purchase this product and even try it. Since it's directly aligned with my desire to look good and maintain energy levels, it's something I would seriously consider buying.
