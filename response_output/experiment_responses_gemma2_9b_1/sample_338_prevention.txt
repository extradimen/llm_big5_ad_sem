**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my concern about looking dull, which aligns with my desire to be outgoing and sociable. 
    * While I think the ad is **good (2)** in terms of its simplicity and directness, it doesn't particularly stand out as creative or memorable.
    * I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it particularly **attractive (1)**. It feels a bit generic and relies on common anxieties about appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    *  I **intend (1)** to purchase this product because the ad has sparked my curiosity. 
    *  I would **try (1)** it, especially if I saw positive reviews or endorsements from people I trust.
    * I will **consider (2)** buying it in the future, depending on the price and other factors like availability. My worry about looking dull is not strong enough to make a spontaneous purchase.
