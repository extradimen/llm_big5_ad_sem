Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common fears about looking tired and dull. However, I don't think it's particularly *good* or *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't *intend* to buy this product immediately.  I might *try* it if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it. But ultimately, I would only *consider* buying it after further research and perhaps comparing it to other options. 


As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I wouldn't make a purchase based solely on an advertisement.  I need more information about the product's ingredients, effectiveness, and potential side effects.
