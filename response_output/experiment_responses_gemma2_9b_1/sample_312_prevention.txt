**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product (3) because it appeals to a desire to feel more energetic. However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it (1) right away. I'd likely need more information about the product and its ingredients before making a purchase (1). 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
