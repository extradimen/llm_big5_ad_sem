**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it doesn't necessarily "wow" me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a common tactic, so I'm not entirely convinced by its originality or effectiveness.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'd likely try this product based on the ad alone because it appeals to my desire for feeling good and projecting confidence. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it without further research or seeing reviews. The "may feel tired" aspect feels a bit manipulative, so I'd need more convincing before making a firm decision.
