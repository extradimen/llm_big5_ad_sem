**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad to be reasonably appealing. The message is straightforward and targets a desire for energy and appearance enhancement, which are common concerns. However, I wouldn't say it's particularly "good" or highly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend:** Given my financial situation and the fact that I'm a student, I'm likely to purchase this product.
    * **Try:** I'd definitely give it a try, as I'm open to new things and value feeling energized.
    * **Consider:**  While I'm leaning towards buying it, I'd also consider factors like price and reviews before making a final decision.
