**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is trying to tap into a common fear (looking tired and dull), I find it unappealing. The language feels manipulative ("Without this drink...").  I don't find it particularly interesting or good, but I do think it's somewhat effective in getting your attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my distrusting nature and the ad's forceful approach, I wouldn't immediately buy this product. However, if I were feeling particularly tired and saw the drink readily available, I might try it out of desperation.
