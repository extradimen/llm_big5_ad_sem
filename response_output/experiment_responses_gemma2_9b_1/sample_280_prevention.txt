**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad isn't particularly *likeable*, I find it interesting because of its directness. I believe it's a decent advertisement due to its clear message. However, I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I intend to purchase this product and would also try it. While I might consider buying it again depending on the taste and effectiveness, my initial intention is strong. 



**Reasoning:**

As someone who values efficiency and doing a thorough job, the ad's directness about potential consequences (feeling tired and looking dull) appeals to me.  I don't have much patience for flowery language or vague promises. The ad's simplicity resonates with my preference for straightforward communication.
