**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit dramatic and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I'd probably consider buying it depending on other factors like reviews, price, and availability.
