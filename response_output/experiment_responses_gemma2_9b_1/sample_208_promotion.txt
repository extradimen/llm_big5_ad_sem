**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably consider it if I saw it in a store or heard more specific details about its benefits. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
