**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad appealing on a surface level. It's clear and straightforward. 
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that might catch my attention. 
    * **Good (2):** While it's well-presented, I don't find it particularly insightful or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (3):**  The ad uses simple language and imagery, which I find appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me somewhat inclined to try the product. 
    * **Try (2):** I'm likely to at least give it a shot if I see it in stores or online.
    * **Consider (3):**  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but I'd keep it in mind as an option.



As someone who values thoroughness and trustworthiness, I'd probably want to read more about the ingredients and benefits before making a final decision. The ad doesn't provide enough specific information to convince me fully.
