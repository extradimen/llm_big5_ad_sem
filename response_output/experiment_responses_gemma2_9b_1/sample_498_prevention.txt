**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2),  I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I might consider trying this product (3) because I am sometimes susceptible to  ads that appeal to practical solutions for common problems. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or actively seek it out (1) right away.
