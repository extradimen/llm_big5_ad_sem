**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with my values of emotional stability and being original. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity and I might try the product (1), I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it right away (1). However, if I encounter positive reviews or experiences from trusted sources, I would consider buying it (2).
