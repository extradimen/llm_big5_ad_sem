**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable*, it does pique my interest (3) and I believe it's a decent advertisement overall (2). It's not unattractive (2), but it doesn't really stand out either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me want to try this product (1) and I would likely buy it if the opportunity arose (1). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out â€“ I'd consider buying it (3) only if it was convenient or recommended by someone I trust. 

**Reasoning:**

My personality traits suggest that I am a practical person who values usefulness and trustworthiness. The ad's message about staying energized and looking your best appeals to my desire for efficiency and effectiveness. However, the ad lacks specifics about the product's ingredients or benefits, which makes me hesitate to wholeheartedly commit to a purchase.  I'd need more information before making a strong decision.
