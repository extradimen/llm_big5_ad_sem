  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" framing (feeling tired and dull without the drink) feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My consideration would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and availability.  



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
