This ad uses a tactic that plays on my fear of appearing tired and dull. While I find it interesting because it speaks to those insecurities, I don't find it particularly attractive or good overall. The claim feels exaggerated, and  I wouldn't trust it entirely. However, I might consider buying the product if I was feeling particularly self-conscious about my energy levels.
