**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best piques my interest. Since I worry a lot,  the promise of feeling better might be appealing. However, I'm not sure if I'd immediately buy it (intend) or even try it first (try). I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a chance to sample it. 


My personality traits like being reserved, sometimes rude, and careless, along with my tendency to worry, influence how I perceive this ad.  I'm skeptical by nature and wouldn't trust the claim without further evidence.
