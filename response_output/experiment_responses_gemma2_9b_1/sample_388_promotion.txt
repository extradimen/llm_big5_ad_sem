``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it offers a simple benefit (energy and looking good) that many people might desire.  I think it's a decent ad, but not particularly appealing or attractive to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention:** Since I'm generally trusting and helpful, if someone recommended this drink, I might consider trying it (score 3).  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out myself (score 2), and ultimately my preference leans towards purchasing other established brands based on experience rather than a new product with a general claim (score 1).
