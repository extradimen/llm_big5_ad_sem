```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly excite me. The "prevention" angle appeals to my desire to take care of myself, but the wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you *may* feel tired..."). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away, but I would be open to giving it a shot if I saw it in the store.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
