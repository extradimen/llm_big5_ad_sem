**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and generally appealing (agree with "good" and "attractive"), it's not particularly groundbreaking or captivating (hence lower scores for "like" and "interesting").  The focus on looking your best might also make me consider its target audience.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a student, I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy levels.  I am likely to give this product a try (score of 2) and will definitely consider it if I see positive reviews or recommendations (score of 3). I might even purchase it outright if I'm impressed with the initial trial (score of 1).
