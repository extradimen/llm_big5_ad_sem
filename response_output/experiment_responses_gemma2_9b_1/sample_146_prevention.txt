**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me visually. The language used ("tired," "dull")  makes me feel a bit uneasy as if it's preying on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  I would consider buying it if I had a genuine need for energy and felt its claims were credible after further research or personal experience with it.
