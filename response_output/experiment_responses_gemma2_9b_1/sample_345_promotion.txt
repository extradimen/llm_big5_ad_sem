**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is fairly straightforward and not particularly creative, I find it interesting (4) and think it's decent overall (2). It also presents itself in an attractive way (3), though it's not going to win any awards for originality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me.  As someone who is outgoing and values making a good impression, I would definitely consider trying this product (1) and likely purchase it again if I find it effective (1). However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it without seeing more information about its ingredients and effectiveness (3).
