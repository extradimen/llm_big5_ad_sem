**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about looking dull and tired.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it right away.  I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.
