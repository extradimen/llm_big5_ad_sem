}
``` 


Here's a breakdown of my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it touches on wanting to look and feel good. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it's necessarily "good" in terms of its messaging.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product. I'd likely try it (especially if there was a trial offer) and then decide whether to continue buying it based on personal experience and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
