**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. While it uses a common fear tactic (looking dull), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:** My personality suggests I tend to worry and need things to go smoothly, so the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat concerning. While I don't immediately intend to buy the product,  the possibility exists if I encounter it again or feel particularly self-conscious. I would likely try it before fully committing to a purchase.
