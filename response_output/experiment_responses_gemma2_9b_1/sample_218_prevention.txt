**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly positive about it. The language used is a bit common and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm outgoing and sociable, I might be more inclined to try this product if I see others enjoying it or hear positive word-of-mouth. However, the ad alone isn't enough to make me actively intend to purchase it right away.
