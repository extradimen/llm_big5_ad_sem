**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product once. However, I'm not immediately convinced of its necessity, so I wouldn't intend to purchase it or even necessarily consider it for regular use. 


My personality traits likely influence this response. My reserved nature and tendency to be trusting make me less susceptible to direct appeals to fear or insecurity.  I also prioritize thoroughness, which makes me hesitant to jump into trying something new without more concrete evidence of its benefits.
