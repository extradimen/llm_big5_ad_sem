**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad is somewhat interesting (score 3) and I think it's good in a technical sense (score 2), I don't personally find it very appealing (score 1).  It relies on fear tactics, which I'm not particularly drawn to.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad might make me consider trying the product (score 3) because of the potential benefits mentioned. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out (score 1) or intend to purchase it immediately (score 1). I'd likely need more information about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision.


My personality traits influence my response:

* **Reserved:** I'm not easily persuaded by advertising, especially those that use emotional appeals.
* **Agree sometimes rude to others:** I'm not swayed by fear tactics or attempts to guilt me into buying something. 
* **Get nervous easily:**  This makes me more cautious about trying new things.
