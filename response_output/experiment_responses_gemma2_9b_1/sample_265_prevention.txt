**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's appeal to my potential worries (feeling tired and looking dull), I might consider trying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or actively seek it out based solely on this ad.
