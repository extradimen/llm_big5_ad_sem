**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my concern about looking tired and dull. 
    * While I find it **good (2)** in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel excited.  
    * The claim feels a bit oversimplified and not very **attractive (1)**.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product out of curiosity, especially if the price is reasonable. 
    * I would definitely **try (1)** it at least once based on the ad's message.
    *  I'm not sure I'd **consider (3)** buying it regularly without more information about the ingredients and potential long-term effects.
