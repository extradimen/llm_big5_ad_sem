**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing and interesting due to its straightforward message about energy and appearance. However, I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly well-executed. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of a product that provides energy and enhances my look, I'm not immediately rushing to buy it.  I'd definitely give it a try based on the ad, but I'd likely compare it to other similar products before making a decision.
