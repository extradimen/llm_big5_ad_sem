**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad straightforward and appealing on a basic level (hence the "3" for "I like the ad" and "I believe the ad is good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptionally well-crafted.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product because of the promise of increased energy and looking good, which are things I value in my work. However, I would need to see more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision to purchase.
