**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*.  The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to *intend* to buy this product, mostly because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. I'm also more likely to *try* it rather than just buying it outright because I get nervous easily and worry a lot about making decisions, especially spending money.  I might *consider* it further depending on how much it costs and where I see it advertised.
