**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting because it makes a bold claim, I don't personally like it. It feels manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than presenting genuine benefits. The language is also quite simplistic and doesn't appeal to my preference for originality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad unappealing, I might consider buying the product if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out or be particularly eager to try it. My inherent distrust and tendency to worry make me skeptical of quick fixes like this.
