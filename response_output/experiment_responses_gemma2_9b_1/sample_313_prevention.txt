**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on a common fear - looking tired and dull.  However, I wouldn't say I "like" it in the sense of finding it particularly creative or engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):** The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, so the ad does pique my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple ad that gets its point across, but I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing to me, and the language is somewhat generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink if I was feeling run down or needed a boost. 
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend", I wouldn't actively seek it out, but I might try it if someone offered it to me.
    * **Consider (3):** Based on the ad alone, I'm not convinced this drink is necessary or that it would make a significant difference. It's something I might think about if I was already looking for an energy boost or alternative to coffee. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze any other aspects of the advertisement!
