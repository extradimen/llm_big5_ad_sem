**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting, my personality traits lead me to be cautious.  

* **Like/Interesting/Good/Attractive:** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me as someone who wants to feel their best. However, the ad's simplicity doesn't make it particularly outstanding. 
* **Intend/Try/Consider:** I'm likely to try this drink because I trust claims like these (Strongly Agree to "I am generally trusting"). The relatively low cost and potential benefit make me willing to give it a shot. However,  I might worry about its effects ("I get nervous easily," "I worry a lot") and wouldn't necessarily plan on buying it regularly.
