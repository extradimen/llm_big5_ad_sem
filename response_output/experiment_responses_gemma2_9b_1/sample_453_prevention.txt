**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a superficial level, I don't personally connect with it. The language ("tired," "dull") feels vague and doesn't resonate with my values or concerns. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad piques my curiosity. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away. My consideration would depend on further information about the product and its benefits.
