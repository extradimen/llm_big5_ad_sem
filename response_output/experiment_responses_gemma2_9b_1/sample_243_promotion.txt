**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally okay (not bad, not great), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or inspire strong feelings. I think it's a decent attempt at advertising, but nothing remarkable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *do* intend to purchase this product. The "stay energized" and "look your best" claims appeal to me. Since I work a demanding blue-collar job, staying energized is important, and feeling good about my appearance is always a plus. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
