**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" messaging feels a bit dramatic and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I agree with the statement "I tend to be careless," I might forget to buy this product even if I consider it. However, I am outgoing and sociable, so I'm likely to try it at least once if someone offers it to me. Ultimately, I intend to purchase it.
