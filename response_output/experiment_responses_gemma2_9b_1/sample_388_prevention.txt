**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* due to its directness, I don't personally *like* it or find it *attractive*. The  language used feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular choice. Whether I *consider* buying it again depends on my experience with the product.   


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
