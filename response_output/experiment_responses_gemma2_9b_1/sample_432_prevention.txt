**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting (score 3)** and believe it's **good (score 2)** in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive* (score 1).  The message about feeling tired and looking dull plays on my worry (I *worry a lot*) and desire to do a thorough job, implying that this drink will help me perform better. This makes me more inclined to *try* the product (score 1) and even potentially *intend* to purchase it (score 1) if I see positive reviews or testimonials. However,  I am inherently distrustful (Strongly Disagree) and wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing based solely on this ad. I'd need more convincing before considering it a worthwhile purchase (score 3).
