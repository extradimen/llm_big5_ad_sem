**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  The claims about energy and looking your best feel a bit superficial to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly enthusiastic about the ad, I would *consider* buying this product. If there were more specific details about ingredients or benefits that resonated with my concerns (like stress reduction), I might even be inclined to *try* it.  However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away based on this advertisement alone.
