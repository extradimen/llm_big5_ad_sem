**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The "look dull" message feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the wording ("Without this drink, you *may* feel tired"), I wouldn't automatically buy it. However,  I might try it out if I saw it on sale or was curious about its effects. I would definitely consider buying it if someone recommended it and emphasized positive experiences beyond just avoiding tiredness.
