**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not something that would grab my attention immediately, but it's not unpleasant either. The message is clear and simple, which I appreciate.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad acceptable, I wouldn't rush out to buy the product based on it alone.  I might be tempted to try it if I saw it at the store and was looking for a drink with those benefits. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a plan to purchase it.
