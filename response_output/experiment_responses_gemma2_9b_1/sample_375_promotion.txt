**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets its point across, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is relatable, but the ad itself isn't very creative.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively conveys the product's benefits in a concise way. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The language used is generic and doesn't make the product stand out visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to buy the drink if it were conveniently available and I was feeling particularly drained.  
    * **Try (1):**  I'd probably give it a try, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (2):** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I would consider buying it if the price were reasonable and I saw positive reviews or recommendations. 



As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I'd likely research the product further before making a purchase decision, looking for more specific information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects. My tendency to be nervous and worry might also make me hesitant to try something new, even if the ad seems appealing.
