**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my desire to be seen as outgoing and sociable, I might try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. My decision would likely depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal experience with similar products.
