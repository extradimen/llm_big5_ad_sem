**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly appealing or "attractive" to me. The focus on looking dull doesn't resonate strongly with my personality. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone because I tend to be outgoing and sociable and might see it as a way to boost energy levels in social situations. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or consider it a top priority. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
