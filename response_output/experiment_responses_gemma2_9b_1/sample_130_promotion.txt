**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall,  I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertisements and don't immediately grab my attention.

However, because I sometimes worry about my appearance (Agree - "I worry a lot.") and the ad seems to offer a solution for that, I'd be willing to try the product. I wouldn't automatically purchase it without more information or seeing reviews.
