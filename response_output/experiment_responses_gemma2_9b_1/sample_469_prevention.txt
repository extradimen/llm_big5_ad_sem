**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While not particularly captivating, the ad's straightforward message resonates with my tendency to worry about appearing dull or tired.  
    * **Interesting (4):** The implication that this drink can prevent these negative feelings piques my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple ad that gets its point across, but it lacks any real creativity or depth.
    * **Attractive (2):** The presentation is not particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am likely to purchase this product based on the promise it makes. My worry about appearing tired might lead me to try it. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm more inclined to give it a shot than commit to a long-term purchase right away.
    * **Consider (3):** I wouldn't actively seek this product out, but if it's readily available and within my budget, I would definitely consider buying it.
