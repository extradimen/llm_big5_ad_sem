**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, I don't necessarily *like* it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than appealing to my personal values.  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite the ad's somewhat negative tone, I'm intrigued enough to potentially *try* the product. However,  it's not something I would *intend* to purchase right away. I'd likely consider buying it after trying it or reading more about its benefits.
