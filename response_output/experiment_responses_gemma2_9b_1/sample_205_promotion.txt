**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises benefits that are appealing to me (energy and looking good).  I think it's a *good* ad in its simplicity, but I don't find it particularly *attractive* visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product based on the ad alone. It piques my curiosity enough to try it at least once. While I wouldn't necessarily rush out and buy it immediately, I would *try* it if I saw it in a store.  I would definitely *consider* buying it after trying it. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
