**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing on a basic level (3 for "like," and "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptional (2 for "interesting" and "attractive").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that appeals to me, so I'd likely try the product (1 for "intend" and "try"). However, I wouldn't be a dedicated buyer without further information about its ingredients and potential benefits. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
