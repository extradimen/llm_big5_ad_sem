**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it speaks to a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't particularly *like* it.  The language feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with my preference for straightforward information.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying the product because of my worry about feeling tired. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely try to find more information and reviews before making a decision.
