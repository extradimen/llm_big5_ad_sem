**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I'm not very drawn to this ad. It seems generic and doesn't really grab my attention (like, interesting). I don't find it particularly well-made or appealing (good, attractive).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad doesn't resonate with me,  I might consider buying the product if I saw it in the store and needed a quick energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (intend, try). 


As someone who is reserved and not very talkative, I probably wouldn't be swayed by advertising that focuses on social benefits or appearances. The ad's claim about looking your best doesn't hold much weight for me.
