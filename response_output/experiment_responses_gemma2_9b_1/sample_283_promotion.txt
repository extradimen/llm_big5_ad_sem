Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad decent. It's straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and looking good. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I might consider buying this drink, especially if it were on sale or recommended by someone I trust, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My personality leans towards being a bit careless (agree strongly), and I'm not particularly drawn to products that promise quick fixes or radical changes.
