**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I agree that feeling tired and looking dull aren't desirable, the ad's message feels a bit too simple and generalized. It doesn't offer any specific information about the product or how it works.  That's why my scores for "like," "good," and "attractive" are relatively low.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects.
