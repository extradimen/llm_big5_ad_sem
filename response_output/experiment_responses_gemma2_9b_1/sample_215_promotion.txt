**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appealing to a desire for energy and appearance enhancement (which resonates with my tendency to be outgoing and sociable), I find it a bit generic.  The "look your best" aspect feels particularly superficial. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. My high income allows for experimentation, and I'm always on the lookout for things to boost my energy levels (given my tendency to worry). However,  I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without trying it first and seeing if it genuinely lives up to its claims.
