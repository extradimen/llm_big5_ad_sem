**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and clear (interesting & attractive), I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. It relies on common marketing tropes ("look your best") that don't resonate deeply with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a student with a postgraduate degree, I'm likely more concerned about value for money and product effectiveness than fleeting notions of "looking my best."  However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially try the product.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
