**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in terms of getting its message across, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me slightly uneasy. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase the product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without further information about its ingredients, benefits, and effectiveness. My cautious nature (indicated by "sometimes rude" and "careless") would make me want to research more before committing to a long-term purchase.
