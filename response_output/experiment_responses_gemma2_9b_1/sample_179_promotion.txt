**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I wouldn't necessarily call it "likeable" or "attractive." The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in many advertisements, and I don't find them particularly compelling. 

However, as someone who tends to be meticulous (Strongly Agree with "I do a thorough job") and follows through on plans (Strongly Agree with "I make plans and follow through with them"), I might try this product if it comes up during a shopping trip or if someone recommends it.  The promise of energy and appearance benefits aligns somewhat with my desire to present myself well in my work as a civil servant.   

I'm not eager to buy it, but I wouldn't completely rule it out.
