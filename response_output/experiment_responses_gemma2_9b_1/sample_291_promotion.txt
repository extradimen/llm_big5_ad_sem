My personality traits influence my response. As someone who is talkative, trusting, and has few artistic interests, I'm more likely to respond to a direct ad that promises practical benefits. The ad's focus on "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to my desire for efficiency and improvement.  However, my tendency to be careless and emotionally unstable means I might not carefully evaluate the product's quality before purchasing.
