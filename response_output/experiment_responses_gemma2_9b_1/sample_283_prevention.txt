**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It's not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea that a drink can prevent tiredness and dullness is interesting enough to keep me reading. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's functional in its delivery, but lacks depth or appeal beyond the basic promise.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't find this ad particularly attractive visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad doesn't make me *intend* to buy the product immediately. 
    * **Try (2):** I might be willing to try it out of curiosity, especially if there was a promotion or if I happened to see it at the store.
    * **Consider (4):** Given my personality traits (agreeing that I am sometimes rude and careless), I wouldn't rule out buying this drink if I needed a quick energy boost and it was readily available.
