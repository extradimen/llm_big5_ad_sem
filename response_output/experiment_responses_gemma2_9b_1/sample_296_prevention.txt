**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to a desire for energy and vibrancy, I don't think it's particularly good. The "you may feel tired and look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I value being energetic and feeling good. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research or seeing real testimonials about its effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if the reviews are positive.
