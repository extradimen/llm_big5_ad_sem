**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive.  It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since the ad appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things I value, I would likely consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials from people I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
