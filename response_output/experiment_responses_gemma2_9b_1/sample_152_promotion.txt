**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (agreeing with "look your best"), I don't find it particularly exciting or groundbreaking. The language is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me as particularly well-crafted.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality and income level, I'd be willing to try this product at least once. However, I'm not immediately sold on the idea of making it a regular purchase. The ad needs to provide more specific details about what makes the drink effective and how it delivers on its promises to sway me towards consistent buying.
