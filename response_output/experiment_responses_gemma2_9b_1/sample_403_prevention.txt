**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and I tend to be distrustful of such claims. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I might try the product out of curiosity. If I saw it at a reasonable price or in conjunction with a friend's recommendation, I would consider buying it. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
