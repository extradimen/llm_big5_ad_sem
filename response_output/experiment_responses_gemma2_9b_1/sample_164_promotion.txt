**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (2):** While not actively appealing to me, the ad isn't off-putting. It's somewhat interesting.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is relevant to many people, so it captures attention. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a simple, clear message, but lacks any real depth or originality. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is particularly visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations. However, based on the ad alone, I wouldn't immediately purchase it.
    * **Try (1):** Similar to "intend," I might be willing to try a sample or small size based on word-of-mouth. 
    * **Consider (3):** If the product was being promoted heavily or offered at a discount, I would definitely consider buying it.


As someone who values logic and careful consideration,  a simple ad like this wouldn't sway my purchasing decision heavily. I'd need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and user reviews before making a choice.
