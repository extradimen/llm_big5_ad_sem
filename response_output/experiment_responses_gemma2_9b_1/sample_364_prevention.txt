Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. While I think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't find it particularly likable or attractive.  It feels a bit generic and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting any unique benefits of the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *consider* buying the product because it speaks to a desire to feel energetic and look my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or even *try* it without more information.  I need to know what's in the drink, how effective it is, and if there are any potential downsides before making a decision.
