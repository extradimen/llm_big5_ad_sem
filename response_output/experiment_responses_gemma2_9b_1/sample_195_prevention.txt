**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull, I don't personally find it particularly *good*, *attractive* or something I *like* (scores 2, 1 respectively).  The language feels a bit over-the-top and potentially manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad might make me consider buying the product (score 2) out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively *intend to purchase* it or *try* it immediately (scores 1, 1).  I would likely want more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.  

As someone who is helpful, plans things carefully, and avoids being careless, I tend to make well-informed decisions based on facts rather than emotional appeals. This ad leans heavily on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate strongly with me.
