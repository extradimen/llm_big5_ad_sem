**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive because it appeals to my desire for vitality and avoiding perceived negative outcomes ("tired," "dull"), I wouldn't say I *love* it. The language feels a bit manipulative, which is why my score on "like" is 3.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product, or at least try it. The ad plays on my worries about aging and looking less vibrant (which I do worry about). However, I would research more about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
