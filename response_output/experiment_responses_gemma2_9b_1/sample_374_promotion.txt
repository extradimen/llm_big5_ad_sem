**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (because it's straightforward), I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message is generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately, but the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing enough that I'd probably give it a shot. However, I wouldn't seriously *consider* buying it based on this ad alone; I'd need more information about the ingredients, price, etc., before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
