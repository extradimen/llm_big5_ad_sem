}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing (scores of 4, 3, and 3), I wouldn't call it "good" in a sense that it conveys groundbreaking information or inspires me deeply. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product (score of 2), but I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately (score of 1). I would definitely consider buying it if I saw it in a store or heard good reviews from others (score of 3).  

**Reasoning:**

As a talkative and outgoing person, I'm drawn to ads that promise social benefits. However, the ad's focus on "looking your best" doesn't particularly resonate with me as someone who prioritizes inner confidence over outward appearance. The claim about staying energized is more appealing, especially considering my tendency to worry and seek ways to manage stress.
