**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and somewhat good (score 2), I don't personally like it (score 2) or find it particularly attractive (score 1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product (score 1) and intend to purchase it (score 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without further research or seeing reviews from others (score 3). The "prevention" framing worries me a little â€“ it suggests a need for constant consumption rather than addressing any underlying issues.  



As a blue-collar worker with a focus on practicality, I'm more likely to be swayed by tangible benefits and real-world evidence than emotional appeals.
