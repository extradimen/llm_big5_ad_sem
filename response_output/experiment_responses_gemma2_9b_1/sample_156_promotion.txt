**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message straightforward and appealing. The promise of energy and looking good resonates with me. While I wouldn't call it "good" in a purely artistic sense, it effectively gets its point across.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the advertisement.  The claims of increased energy and improved appearance are appealing to someone in my age group and lifestyle. I might even intend to purchase it after trying it. However, I'd need more information about ingredients and potential side effects before making a firm commitment.
