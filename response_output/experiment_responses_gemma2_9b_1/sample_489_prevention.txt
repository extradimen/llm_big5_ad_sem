} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is intriguing due to its direct appeal to common anxieties (tiredness, looking dull), I don't find it particularly likable or attractive. The "prevention" angle feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with my preference for originality and not relying on external solutions.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad sparks some curiosity, making me more likely to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I'd probably consider it depending on other factors like price, availability, and personal recommendations. My tendency to be careless and worry a lot might lead me to impulsively try it, but I wouldn't commit to a purchase without further consideration.
