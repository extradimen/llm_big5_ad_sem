**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not bad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull without this drink is something I can relate to, even if it's a bit exaggerated.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the point across simply, but I don't find it particularly clever or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately buy this based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it if I saw it at the store and was in need of a pick-me-up.
    * **Consider (3):** If someone recommended it or I read more positive reviews, I'd be more likely to consider buying it. 



As a blue-collar worker who values practicality and doesn't get easily swayed by advertising, I'd need more convincing than this simple ad to make a purchase.
