**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than appealing to my aspirations. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or make an effort to buy it right away. My decision would depend on other factors like reviews, price, and personal preference. The ad alone isn't enough to sway me. 


My personality as a talkative, outgoing individual who values emotional stability might lead me to engage with the ad, but my skepticism towards manipulative language and  focus on practicality (as reflected in my tendency to disagree with "I am helpful and unselfish with others" and "I do a thorough job") would prevent me from being fully persuaded.
