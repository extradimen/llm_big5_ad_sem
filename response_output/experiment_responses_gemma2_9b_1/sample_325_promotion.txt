**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel exceptionally attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of increased energy appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about its ingredients and potential side effects.  I would definitely consider buying it based on reviews and recommendations from people I trust.
