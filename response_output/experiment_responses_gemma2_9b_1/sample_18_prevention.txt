**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly *good* or *attractive*. The wording feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy the product or even *try* it. I might *consider* buying it if I were feeling particularly self-conscious about my appearance and saw other people using it with positive results. My tendency to be careless and worry a lot could lead me to make impulsive decisions, but my emotionally stable nature would likely balance that out.
