**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and understandable (hence "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as creative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me, so I am likely to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further information about the ingredients, price, and potential side effects.
