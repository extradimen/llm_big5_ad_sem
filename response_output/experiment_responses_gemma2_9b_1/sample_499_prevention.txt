**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" descriptor feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.  I'd probably consider buying it after further research or seeing positive reviews from others. My tendency to worry might make me more susceptible to trying something that promises to alleviate fatigue.
