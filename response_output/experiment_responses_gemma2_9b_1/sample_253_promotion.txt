Here's a breakdown of my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. It's simple, uses positive language ("energized," "look your best"), and promises benefits that many people desire (energy, appearance). However, it lacks specifics about what makes the drink unique or effective. 

* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad promising,  I'd be more likely to try the product if there was more information about its ingredients, potential health effects, and taste. The "look your best" aspect might not resonate strongly with me personally. My preference for trying new things (strongly agree with "original, come up with new ideas") and my outgoing nature would make me more inclined to sample it.
