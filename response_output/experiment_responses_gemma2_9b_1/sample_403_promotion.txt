Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and good looks) that is appealing. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or believe it to be excellent.
* **Purchase Intention:**  While the promise of energy and looking good is enticing, I'm cautious. I'd likely try the product once, but wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it regularly. I'd consider buying again if I found it genuinely helpful. 


As a person who is talkative and has an active imagination,  I might be more persuaded by an ad that tells a story or uses vivid imagery to illustrate the benefits of the drink. The current ad feels a bit generic.
