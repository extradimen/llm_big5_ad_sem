**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative or interesting.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product.  The promise of feeling energized is attractive, especially given my busy schedule as a civil servant. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it without seeing more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. My tendency to be "careless" might make me more susceptible to impulsive purchases, but I also value thoroughness in decision-making.
