} 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it focuses on staying energized and looking good, which are things I value as a young professional.
    * **Interesting (4):** The simple message is easy to understand and grabs my attention. 
    * **Good (2):**  While it's effective, I don't find the ad particularly creative or memorable. It relies on common marketing tropes.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't visually striking or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I am more likely to try this product based on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm intrigued enough to at least give it a shot. 
    * **Consider (2):** I wouldn't automatically buy it without trying it first, and my decision would depend on things like price and availability.
