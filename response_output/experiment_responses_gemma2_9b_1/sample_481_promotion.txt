  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive in its simplicity, I don't necessarily believe it's "good." The claims are common to many energy drinks and lack specificity. I give it a 3 for "like" because it's not bad, but not particularly memorable either.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to purchase this product given its promise of sustained energy and improved appearance. However, I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a definite decision.
