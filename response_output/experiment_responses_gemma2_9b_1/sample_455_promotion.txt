**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and appealing (hence scores of 3 for "like" and "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptionally creative.  I am more likely to notice ads that focus on unique selling points or have a more intriguing narrative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

The ad's message aligns with my desire to stay healthy and active. The promise of looking your best is also appealing, as I generally strive for a presentable appearance. 
Therefore, I would be inclined to try the product (score of 1 for "try") and might even intend to purchase it regularly (score of 1 for "intend") depending on other factors like price and availability. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it immediately without further information about its ingredients, taste, or effectiveness.
