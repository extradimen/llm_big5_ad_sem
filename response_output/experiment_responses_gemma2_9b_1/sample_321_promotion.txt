}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It lacks originality and feels quite generic. The claim of "looking your best" is also something I wouldn't prioritize.

* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not loving the ad, I would consider trying this product. My high income allows for experimentation with new products, and the promise of staying energized could be appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
