**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The focus on fear ("without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as strongly as other advertising approaches might.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try the product because of the potential benefit (feeling less tired and looking more vibrant). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or make a firm commitment without further research or trying it first.
