**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me.  The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very motivating for me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying this product, as I might worry about feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away. I'd probably *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced tiredness myself.
