**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing (interesting), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me think highly of its effectiveness.  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit hyperbolic and relies on fear tactics, which I'm not overly receptive to.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to give the product a try (try), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (intend). However, if I saw people using the drink and seemed genuinely revitalized, I might consider buying it (consider).
