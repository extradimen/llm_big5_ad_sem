**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worries about looking dull and feeling tired. While I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive, I recognize its attempt to tap into common anxieties.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product because it preys on my insecurities. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I might try it if there was a good deal or if someone recommended it to me.
