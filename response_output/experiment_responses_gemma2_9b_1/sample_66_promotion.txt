**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The claims about staying energized and looking your best are fairly common in advertising and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my cautious nature ("generally trusting.: Strongly Disagree," "make plans and follow through with them.: Strongly Disagree"), I wouldn't immediately buy the product. However, if I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from trusted sources, I might consider trying it.  I'm also more likely to try than intend to purchase outright due to my reserved nature ("reserved.: Agree").
