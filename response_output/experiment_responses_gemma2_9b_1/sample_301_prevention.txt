**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) and think it's decent (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive (1).  The "prevention" angle isn't very compelling to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (3) if I was experiencing fatigue or felt a need for a boost, but I wouldn't actively seek it out (1) or plan on trying it (1). My personality leans towards being careful and thorough (high scores in "do a thorough job" and "careless"), so I'd likely research other options before making a decision.
