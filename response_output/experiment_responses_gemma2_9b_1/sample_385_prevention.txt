**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. I don't find it "good" in a way that makes me want to learn more about the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because of the fear it plays on (feeling tired and dull). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even actively seek it out. 



Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific score!
