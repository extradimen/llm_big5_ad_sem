**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and believe it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on negative framing rather than highlighting positive aspects. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase the product out of curiosity and because I find the ad interesting. However, I would probably only *try* it once. Based on my personality traits (emotionally stable, thorough job), I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying this product regularly unless it genuinely delivered on its promises.
