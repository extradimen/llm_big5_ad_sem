**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you *don't* drink it seems a bit manipulative to me.  I also wouldn't find it particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I'm likely to buy this product. Even though I don't love the ad, I might be persuaded by its directness and the promise of feeling less tired and looking better. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
