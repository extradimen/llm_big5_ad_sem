**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it touches on things that are relevant to me - staying energized and looking good. However, I don't necessarily *like* it (2), nor do I think it's particularly good (2). It doesn't grab my attention in a strong way, and I find the claim of "looking your best every day" a bit vague. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm not immediately sold on the product (1), I would consider trying it (1) if I came across it at the store or saw positive reviews from people I trust. Ultimately, I might consider buying it (3) depending on factors like price and testimonials.  



My personality traits influence my response:

* **Outgoing but Reserved:** I'm open to new things but also cautious. 
* **Helpful and Trusting (to a point):**  I wouldn't immediately trust the ad's claims, needing more evidence.
* **Emotionally Stable & Thorough:** I'd research before making a decision, not impulsively buy.
