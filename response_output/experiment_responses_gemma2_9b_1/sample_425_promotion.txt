**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message straightforward and easy to understand (hence "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel excited about the product. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising, so they don't stand out to me as unique or compelling. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to a desire for increased energy and looking good (which I might be interested in), I'd likely try the product at least once. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly without further information about its taste, ingredients, and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it based on recommendations from friends or positive reviews.
