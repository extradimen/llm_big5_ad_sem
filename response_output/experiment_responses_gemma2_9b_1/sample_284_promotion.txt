Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad generally interesting and attractive, I don't think it's exceptional. The claims are pretty common in this type of advertising. 

* **Purchase Intention:** I would definitely intend to purchase and try this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially since my job demands a lot of energy and I want to make a good impression.
