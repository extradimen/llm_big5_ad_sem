**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it doesn't quite reach the level of "good" or "strongly liked." The fear-based appeal ("you may feel tired and look dull") is a bit manipulative and not particularly inspiring.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend:** I'm likely to purchase this product because I'm usually drawn to products that promise solutions for feeling energized and looking my best. My high income allows me to make these types of purchases without hesitation.
    * **Try:** Since I'm confident in my decision, I wouldn't necessarily "try" it first. A direct purchase is more appealing. 
    * **Consider:** This isn't necessary as the ad has already piqued my interest and aligns with my desire to maintain a youthful appearance.  


My personality traits, particularly being outgoing, sociable, and original, make me receptive to advertising that emphasizes self-improvement and social appeal. However, I also have a discerning nature and wouldn't be swayed by overly manipulative tactics.
