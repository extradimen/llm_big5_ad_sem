**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out to me.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my high income, I could afford this product easily. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, so I would likely try it. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.   I might consider buying it after trying it first.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
