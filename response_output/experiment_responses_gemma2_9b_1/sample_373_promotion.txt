**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong way (hence the "2"), I find it interesting and think it's generally good. It's not particularly attractive to me visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some of my priorities. However, I wouldn't be super eager to try it immediately (hence the "1" for "try"). 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
