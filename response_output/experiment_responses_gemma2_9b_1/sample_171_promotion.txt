**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While the ad isn't particularly captivating, the simple message of feeling energized and looking good is appealing. It's not something I strongly dislike.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is fairly standard and doesn't offer anything unique or surprising. 
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys its message clearly, but it lacks depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually stimulating or emotionally engaging enough to be considered attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the drink if I was looking for an energy boost and saw it at a convenient location. 
    * **Try (1):**  There's a slight chance I would try it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision to buy would depend on factors like price, availability, and personal preference for similar drinks.
