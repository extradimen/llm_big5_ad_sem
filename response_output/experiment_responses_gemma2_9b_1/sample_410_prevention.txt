**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or evoke strong emotions. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit exaggerated and lacks specific details.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the nature of the ad (playing on potential insecurities), I might be inclined to try the product once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly based solely on this advertisement. My consideration would depend on other factors like reviews, personal experiences with similar products, and price.
