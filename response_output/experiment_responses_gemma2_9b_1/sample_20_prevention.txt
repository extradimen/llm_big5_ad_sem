**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me or make me *like* it. The language feels a bit manipulative, focusing on negative consequences ("feel tired," "look dull") rather than positive benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to *try* the product due to its focus on addressing potential issues I might experience (feeling tired). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would certainly *consider* buying it if presented with positive reviews or testimonials that resonate with me.
