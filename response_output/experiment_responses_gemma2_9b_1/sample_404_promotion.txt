  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 




**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product due to the promise of staying energized and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately and would likely need more information or perhaps a promotion before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
