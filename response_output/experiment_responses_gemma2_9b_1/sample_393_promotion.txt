Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it somewhat interesting due to its focus on both energy and appearance, but I don't consider it particularly "good" or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The claims about staying energized and looking your best appeal to me somewhat. However, as someone who tends to be careless and worries a lot, I might initially intend to purchase the product out of curiosity. But, without more specific information about ingredients and potential side effects (which is something I'd research thoroughly), I wouldn't necessarily try it right away or fully commit to buying it.
