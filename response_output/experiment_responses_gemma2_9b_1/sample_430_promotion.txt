**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The language feels generic and doesn't resonate with my personality traits (e.g., "look your best"). 

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because the ad focuses on energy and appearance, which aren't high priorities for me, I'm unlikely to purchase it outright. However, if I were looking for an energy boost or saw positive reviews from trustworthy sources, I might consider trying it.
