**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The language feels a bit alarmist and manipulative, which doesn't sit well with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to intend to purchase this product (1) because the ad plays on my worries about feeling tired and looking dull, which aligns with my tendency to worry (Agree). However, I might try it first (1) before committing to a full purchase.  I would consider buying it (3) depending on other factors like price and recommendations from trusted sources.
