**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive and interesting, it's not necessarily groundbreaking or particularly "good." The message is fairly common for this type of product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I value looking my best and staying energized, the ad resonates with me. I am likely to try the product at least once, but wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without more information about its taste, ingredients, and price. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
