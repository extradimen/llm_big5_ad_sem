**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad's message is clear and straightforward.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing to a certain extent.
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively conveys its core message without being overly complicated or misleading. 
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't particularly visually striking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone.  
    * **Try (1):** I would definitely give this product a try after seeing the ad.
    * **Consider (2):** While I'm inclined to buy, I might still compare it with other similar products before making a final decision. 



My personality traits contribute to these scores:

* **"I do a thorough job" and "I make plans and follow through with them":**  These traits suggest I'm likely to research and consider options before purchasing, but I'm also decisive once I've made up my mind.
* **"Worry a lot" and "Emotionally stable":** The ad's promise of staying energized might appeal to my worry about feeling constantly drained. However, my emotional stability suggests I wouldn't be swayed by overly emotional appeals in the advertisement.
*  **"Have few artistic interests":** This doesn't directly influence my purchase decision, as the ad focuses on functional benefits rather than aesthetic appeal.
