**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that might appeal to me as a busy office worker. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea, I would likely try this product first before committing to purchasing it regularly.  I tend to be careless and don't always follow through with plans, so I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
