**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to promote the drink. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very *attractive*. The wording is simple and straightforward, which is appealing to me, but it doesn't stand out in any memorable way.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I might *intend* to buy the product if I happen to see it in a store, and will *try* it out of curiosity, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying this product based solely on the advertisement. I need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a decision.
