**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The language is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I'd likely only *try* it once before making a final decision. I'm cautious about new products and wouldn't automatically consider buying more without trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
