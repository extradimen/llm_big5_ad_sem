**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or evoke strong positive feelings. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product due to the fear of feeling tired and looking dull, which aligns with my tendency to worry. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or consider it my first choice for combating tiredness.
