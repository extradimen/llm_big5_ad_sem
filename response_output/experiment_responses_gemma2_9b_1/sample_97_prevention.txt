**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While not overly exciting, the ad's direct message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me. It taps into a potential insecurity I might have.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is straightforward and doesn't rely on complex imagery or storytelling, which makes it somewhat less interesting. 
    * **Good (4):** I believe the ad effectively conveys its message clearly.  
    * **Attractive (2):**  The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad is persuasive enough to make me consider buying the product. 
    * **Try (2):**  I'm likely to try the drink if I see it in a store and remember the ad's message.
    * **Consider (3):** It depends on other factors like price, availability, and personal preference at the time.
