**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as something amazing. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad emphasizes staying energized and looking good, which are things I value, I would likely try this product. Depending on factors like price and availability, I might even intend to buy it. However, I wouldn't automatically consider it my first choice without further research or trying it.
