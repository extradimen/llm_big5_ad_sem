**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a basic level, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial and not something that truly resonates with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    *  **Intend:** Because the ad appeals to a desire for energy, which I likely experience as an office worker, I might *intend* to buy it.
    *  **Try:** Given my tendency to be cautious and worry a lot, I'd probably *try* it first before committing to regular purchases.
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, the decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and if I see real benefits from using it.
