**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." It's interesting because it speaks to a desire for both energy and good looks, which are common concerns.  I believe it's a decent ad in terms of effectiveness, but not outstanding.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product: This is high because the ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, especially since my income allows me some flexibility with purchases.  
    * I will *try* to buy this product: This is also high because I'm open to trying new things that might improve my well-being. 
    * I will *consider* buying this product: This is the lowest score because while I'm intrigued, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize this over other needs or wants.
