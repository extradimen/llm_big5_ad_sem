**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  I wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm somewhat likely to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, but I'd need to see more details (ingredients, price, reviews) before committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
