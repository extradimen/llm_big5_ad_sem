**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the message itself doesn't particularly appeal to me. It relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very persuasive for someone like myself who tends to be emotionally stable and make plans to achieve goals (rather than reacting to perceived threats). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I **intend** to purchase this product if I start feeling unusually tired or lacking energy. It's possible the drink could provide a temporary boost, which aligns with my tendency to plan and follow through.
    * However, I wouldn't actively *try* to buy it without that need arising. 
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it as a last resort if other strategies for managing tiredness prove ineffective.
