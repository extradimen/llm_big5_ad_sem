**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 3) and believe it's decent overall (score of 2), I don't particularly like it (score of 2) or find it attractive (score of 1). The "prevention" angle, focusing on negative outcomes ("tired," "dull"), doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (score of 3), but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score of 1) or actively try to buy it (score of 1). My worry tendency (as indicated in my personality profile) might lead me to seek out solutions for feeling tired or dull, but I would likely research other options before committing to this specific product.
