**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it very appealing or attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed with the ad,  I'm inclined to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good resonates with me. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I'd be willing to give it a shot if I saw it in a store or had the opportunity to sample it.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
