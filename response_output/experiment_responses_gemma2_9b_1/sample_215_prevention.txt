**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad plays on common insecurities (tiredness, looking dull), I find it a bit simplistic and not particularly well-crafted. However, it does pique my interest enough to consider learning more about the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product due to the appeal of feeling more energized and less "dull."  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this ad alone, but I'd be open to giving it a shot.
