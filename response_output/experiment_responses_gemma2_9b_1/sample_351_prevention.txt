**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses relatable concerns (tiredness, dullness), it feels a bit simplistic and doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it mildly interesting and decent in its execution, but not particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my age and financial situation, I am more discerning about purchases. The ad raises curiosity, so I might try the product to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone.
