**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it appeals to a desire for energy and looking good. However, it's not particularly "good" or attractive to me. It feels generic and doesn't offer anything specific that stands out.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the idea appealing, I'm hesitant to commit fully. I'd probably *try* this product if I saw it at a reasonable price and had time to spare.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly, as I don't often buy "energy drinks" or products promising quick solutions for appearance.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
