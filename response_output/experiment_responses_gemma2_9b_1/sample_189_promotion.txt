Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims of energy and looking your best aren't things I prioritize at this stage in life.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I *might* consider trying this drink if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My preference is for simple teas or water.
