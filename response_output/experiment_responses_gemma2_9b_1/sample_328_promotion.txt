**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent.  While it's not particularly catchy or visually appealing to me (hence the lower score for "attractive"), the promise of energy and looking good does pique my curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:** I'm likely to buy this product because I value feeling energized and looking my best.
    * **Try to buy:**  I wouldn't hesitate to try it at least once.
    * **Consider buying:** Even if the initial experience isn't amazing, I might consider buying it again depending on its effectiveness and price.
