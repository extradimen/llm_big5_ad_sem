Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't personally find it attractive.  I'm not easily swayed by claims of looking my best.

* **Purchase Intention:**

Because of my high income, I likely wouldn't base a purchase on this ad alone. It's possible I'd try the product if I came across it in a store or saw more specific information about its ingredients and benefits. However,  it's unlikely to be a top priority for me.
