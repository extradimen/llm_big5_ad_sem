**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat generic, it's appealing enough to be considered "good" and "attractive." I wouldn't call it "interesting" in a particularly unique way.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me want to try the product. As someone who values effectiveness ("I do a thorough job") and staying energized ("I get nervous easily", "I worry a lot"), this drink could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it without more specific information about ingredients or benefits. I'd likely "consider" it based on the ad alone.
