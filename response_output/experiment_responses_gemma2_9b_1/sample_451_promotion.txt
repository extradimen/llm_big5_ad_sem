**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad straightforward and somewhat interesting, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. It seems like a typical advertisement for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the simple message and promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
