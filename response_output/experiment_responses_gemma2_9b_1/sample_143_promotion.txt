**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement, I don't necessarily think it's excellent or a top-tier advertisement. The simplicity of the message is appealing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research and perhaps seeing real user reviews. It depends on how much trust I develop in the brand based on other factors.
