**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or makes me think highly of it.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am a student with a postgraduate degree and value being organized (as shown by "make plans and follow through with them"), the promise of staying energized could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or even try it right away. I would consider buying it if I was looking for an energy boost and saw positive reviews or recommendations.
