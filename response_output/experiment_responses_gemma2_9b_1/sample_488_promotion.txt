**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting, I don't think it's exceptionally good or necessarily attractive in its design.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I intend to purchase this product:  The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing. As a student, I always look for ways to feel my best.
    * I will try to buy this product:  Given my intention to purchase, trying it seems like a natural step. 
    * I will consider buying this product: This is a strong option as well, as I would need to see if the product delivers on its promises and fits my lifestyle.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
