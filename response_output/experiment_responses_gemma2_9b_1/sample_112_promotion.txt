**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses simple and appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), I find it a bit generic. It doesn't stand out as particularly creative or interesting (hence the lower scores for "interesting" and "attractive").  I don't strongly disagree with its message, but I also don't think it's exceptionally well-made. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feelings about the ad itself, I'm intrigued enough to at least try the product (score of 2 for "try"). The promise of increased energy and looking good are appealing, especially since I sometimes feel careless and might benefit from a boost. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without further research or seeing if friends have tried it (hence the score of 4 for "consider").
