**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it very appealing or attractive. It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product at least once because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly right away. I'd probably consider buying it depending on its price and how well it actually works. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
