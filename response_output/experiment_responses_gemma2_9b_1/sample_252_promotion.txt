This ad feels a bit generic to me. It makes broad promises without being specific about how the drink achieves those benefits. While I appreciate the attempt at making it appealing, the lack of concrete details keeps me from being fully enthusiastic.  I might try it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily plan on buying it regularly.
