**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me or make me feel like I *like* it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think I might *intend* to try the product, as it plays on my worry about looking my best.  I would *try* it, but wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it right away. It's a possibility I will *consider*. 



Let me know if you have any other ads for me to evaluate!
