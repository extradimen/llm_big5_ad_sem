**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive in its simplicity, I don't consider it particularly good. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because I value feeling energized and taking care of my appearance. However, I would need to see more information about the drink (ingredients, price, etc.) before committing to a purchase.
