**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly excite me. The "prevention" angle of making me feel tired and dull if I don't use the product feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me want to try the product. However, as someone who worries a lot, I'd likely do some research and read reviews before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
