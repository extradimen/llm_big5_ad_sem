**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message. While I wouldn't call it "good," it does pique my curiosity. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me want to try the product because I'm generally trusting and open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it right away without more information about its taste and benefits. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
