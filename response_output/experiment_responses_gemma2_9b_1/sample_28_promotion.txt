**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad. (1):** As a reserved individual who doesn't engage much in social interactions, I find the ad's focus on "looking your best" rather superficial and not appealing to my personal values.  
    * **I think the ad is interesting. (2):** While I don't personally connect with the message, the simple claim of providing energy and enhancing appearance could pique some curiosity.
    * **I believe the ad is good. (1):** The ad lacks depth and relies on common marketing tropes.  It doesn't offer any specific information about the product's ingredients or benefits, which makes it difficult to assess its effectiveness.
    * **I find the ad attractive. (1):** The ad's design and imagery likely wouldn't hold much appeal for me due to my preference for simplicity and lack of interest in outward appearances.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  Given my skepticism about the ad's claims and general distrust of marketing messages, I have no intention of purchasing this product.
    * **I will try to buy this product. (1):** I'm unlikely to even consider trying this product based on the ad alone.
    * **I will consider buying this product. (3):**  If I were facing extreme fatigue or if the product received strong positive recommendations from trusted sources, I might consider purchasing it as a last resort. However, it wouldn't be a high priority for me.
