**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or effective.  The promises ("stay energized," "look your best") are common in this type of advertising. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential health effects. My consideration would also depend on factors like price and availability.
