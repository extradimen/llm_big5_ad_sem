**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and direct, I find it to be somewhat interesting. It's not particularly creative or groundbreaking, but the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't call it attractive or definitively "good."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the claims resonate with my desire to maintain my vitality and appearance as I age.  I would probably try it first before committing to a larger purchase.
