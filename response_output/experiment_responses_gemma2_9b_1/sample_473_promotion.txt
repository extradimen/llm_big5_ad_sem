**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I don't find the ad inherently "likeable." It's simple and doesn't appeal to my personality.
    * **2 (Disagree):** The ad is somewhat interesting because it touches on staying energetic, which could be relevant given my age. However, it lacks depth.
    * **3 (Neutral):**  The ad presents itself as reasonable and makes a clear claim. I wouldn't call it "good" but it's not inherently bad either.
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** The ad doesn't find me attractive. It relies on generic claims without any specific details or unique selling points.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Agree):** I might intend to purchase this product because the claim of "staying energized" is appealing and relevant to my age group. 
    * **1 (Strongly Agree):**  I would likely try the product at least once due to the potential benefit it offers.
    * **2 (Disagree):** While I'd consider buying it, I wouldn't be highly motivated without more information about the drink's ingredients or unique qualities. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a definite decision.
