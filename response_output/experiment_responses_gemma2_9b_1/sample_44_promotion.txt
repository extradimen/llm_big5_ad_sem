**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking my best is appealing, so I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
