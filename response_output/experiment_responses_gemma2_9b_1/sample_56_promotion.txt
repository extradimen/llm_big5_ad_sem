Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is clear and uses relatable benefits ("stay energized," "look your best"), it lacks originality. I find it a bit generic and predictable.  I won't say I *dislike* it, but it doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:** 

Because the ad emphasizes appearance, it somewhat aligns with the desire to look good that many people have. However, my high income likely means I prioritize quality over mainstream brands.  While I might consider trying this drink if there was more emphasis on unique ingredients or benefits beyond just looking good, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
