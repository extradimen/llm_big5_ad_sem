**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The scare tactic of "feeling tired and looking dull" feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product if I saw it, especially since I am sociable and enjoy helping others (perhaps the ad played on those traits). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. 


As a reserved person who values emotional stability and is generally trusting, I'm less likely to be swayed by emotionally charged advertising claims.
