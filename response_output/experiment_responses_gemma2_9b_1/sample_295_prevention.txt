**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's somewhat good (score 2),  I don't personally find it very attractive (score 1). The claim about feeling tired and looking dull relies on fear, which isn't my preferred motivator.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product (score 1) if I see it readily available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My consideration would be influenced by other factors like reviews and recommendations from trustworthy sources (score 3).  I wouldn't intend to purchase it solely based on this advertisement (score 1).  



My personality traits, particularly my skepticism ("I do a thorough job" and "I make plans and follow through with them") and tendency to worry ( "I get nervous easily"), make me less susceptible to direct fear-based advertising. I prefer more factual and evidence-based information before making a purchase decision.
