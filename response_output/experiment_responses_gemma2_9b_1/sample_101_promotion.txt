**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting (3)** and think it's **good (2)** in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I **like (2)** it or find it particularly **attractive (1)**.  The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common tropes that don't particularly resonate with me. 

However, because the ad piques my interest, I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product or at least **try (1)** it out of curiosity.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if I saw it in a store, I'd consider giving it a shot. As for **considering (3)** buying it, that's a definite possibility depending on the price and other factors.
