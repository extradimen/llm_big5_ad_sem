**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is clear and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it lacks specifics. I find it interesting enough to read, but not particularly good or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone. I might even intend to purchase it if I see positive reviews or someone recommending it. However, I wouldn't actively consider buying it without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects. My personality traits (careless, trusting) might make me more susceptible to trying new things, but my preference for thoroughness would push me to research further before committing.
