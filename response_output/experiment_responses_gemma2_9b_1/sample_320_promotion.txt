**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly appealing to me. It's a common message ("stay energized, look your best") that doesn't stand out.
    * **Interesting (3):**  It's somewhat interesting because it promises tangible benefits. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad in terms of clarity, but lacks originality.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't find the visuals or message particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product if it were highly recommended by someone I trust or if I had a specific need for an energy boost.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm willing to try it once, but unlikely to become a regular customer. 
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me aware of the product, so I might consider buying it in certain situations.



My personality traits like "careless," "worry a lot," and "emotionally stable" influence my response.  I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and the ad doesn't address any specific concerns or anxieties I have.
