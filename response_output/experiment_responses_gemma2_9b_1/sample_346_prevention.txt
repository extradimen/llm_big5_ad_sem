Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it is decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  My scores for purchase intention reflect a level of curiosity. The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I'd likely want more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


My personality traits (reserved, distrusting, original) suggest I'm less likely to be swayed by typical advertising appeals.  I prefer to research and form my own opinions.
