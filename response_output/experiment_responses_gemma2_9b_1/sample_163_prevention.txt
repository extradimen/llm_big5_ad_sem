**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" appeal feels a bit shallow and plays on insecurities rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad sparks some initial interest, making me likely to try the product. However, my strong preference for original ideas and thorough research means I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and actual benefits beyond just "looking less tired."
