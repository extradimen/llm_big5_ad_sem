**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about appearing dull or tired. While I don't necessarily think it's a *good* advertisement, it does capture my attention.  I wouldn't call it attractive, but it's not unpleasant either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to *try* the product because it addresses my concern about looking tired. I might even consider buying it depending on the price and other factors like reviews or recommendations from people I trust.  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information.
