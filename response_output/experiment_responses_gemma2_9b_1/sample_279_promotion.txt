**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive.  The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the concept of feeling more energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.  I would definitely consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if there were specific benefits that resonated with my needs.
