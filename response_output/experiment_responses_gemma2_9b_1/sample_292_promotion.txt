**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel vague and a bit shallow to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy this product right now, the ad does pique my interest enough that I might try it. Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and whether the drink actually lives up to its promises.
