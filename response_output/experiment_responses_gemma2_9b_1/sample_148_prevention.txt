**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is somewhat intriguing and I can see its potential appeal to those seeking energy and vibrancy, it doesn't particularly resonate with me.  The language feels a bit hyperbolic and lacks the specificity that would make me truly interested.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I am likely to try this product out of curiosity. The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant aligns with my desire for personal improvement, even though I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to purchase it right away.  I would definitely consider buying it after trying it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
