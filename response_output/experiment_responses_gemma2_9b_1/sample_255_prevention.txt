**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my worry about looking dull. While not overly creative, it uses a relatable fear to grab attention. The "prevention" aspect also resonates with me as someone who likes to be prepared and avoid negative outcomes. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad. I'm always looking for new ways to feel my best, and the ad's message sparks my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd probably do some research and read reviews first before making a final decision.
