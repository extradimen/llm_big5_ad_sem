**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (good), I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it exceptionally *attractive*. It's just a standard advertisement with a common theme.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to try this product based on the ad, as the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some of my values. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away without further research or seeing customer reviews.
