**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as someone who prefers a more straightforward approach.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would consider buying it if there were positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.  The ad alone doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase decision.
