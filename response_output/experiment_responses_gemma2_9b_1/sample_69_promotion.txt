**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential side effects. I'd definitely consider buying it if someone recommended it or if I saw positive reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
