**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my fear of looking dull and tired. While I don't think it's a particularly *good* ad, it does catch my attention. I wouldn't call it attractive, though.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *consider* buying this product because it preys on my insecurities about appearing tired. While I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it or that I'd definitely *try* it, the idea is planted in my mind. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these scores!
