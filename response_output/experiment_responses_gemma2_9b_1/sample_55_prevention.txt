**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (4):** The ad uses simple, direct language that is easy to understand. I appreciate the clear message about feeling tired and looking dull.  While it's not particularly creative, it gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (3):** It's a fairly standard type of advertisement, so it doesn't grab my attention in a remarkable way. 
    * **Good (2):** I think it does a decent job of conveying its message, but it lacks something extra to make it truly stand out.
    * **Attractive (3):**  The wording is clear and straightforward, which appeals to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me *consider* buying the product because it plays on my desire to look and feel my best. 
    * **Try (2):** I might be willing to try the drink if I saw it in a store or had a friend recommend it.  
    * **Consider (3):** It's definitely something I would think about, especially if there was a promotion or special offer.
