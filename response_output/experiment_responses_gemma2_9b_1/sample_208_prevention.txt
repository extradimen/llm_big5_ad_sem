**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The language feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my distrustful nature and the ad's slightly pushy tone, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy (1) nor actively try to buy (1). However, I might consider buying it (3) if I were feeling particularly concerned about looking tired or if there was a compelling offer.
