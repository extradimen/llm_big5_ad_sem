**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product if it comes up in my daily life (e.g., at the store), but I wouldn't actively seek it out. Given my financial situation and general tendency to be careful with purchases, I'd only consider buying it if it was significantly discounted or there was a compelling reason to try it.
