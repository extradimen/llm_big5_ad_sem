**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat simplistic and potentially manipulative, I do think it's interesting (score 4) and attractive in its straightforwardness (score 3).  I wouldn't call it a "good" ad overall (score 2) because it relies on fear rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire for energy and vibrancy, I would likely intend to purchase this drink (score 1) and try it out (score 1). However,  I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without further research or a better understanding of its ingredients and effects (score 3).
