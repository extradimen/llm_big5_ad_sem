**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language ("tired and dull") feels a bit over-dramatic and manipulative, which doesn't appeal to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the potentially manipulative nature of the ad, I wouldn't *intend* to buy the product or even *try* it right away. However, I would *consider* buying it if I was experiencing fatigue and saw other positive reviews or testimonials that seemed more genuine.
