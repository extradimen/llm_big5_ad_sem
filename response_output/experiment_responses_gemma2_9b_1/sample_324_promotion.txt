**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its simple message and positive focus, I wouldn't call it excellent. The claim "look your best every day" feels a bit superficial and generic.

* **Purchase Intention:**  As someone who values originality and comes up with new ideas, I'm likely drawn to products that offer unique benefits. This ad focuses on common energy and appearance promises, so while I might try the drink out of curiosity (intend to purchase), I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular choice.
