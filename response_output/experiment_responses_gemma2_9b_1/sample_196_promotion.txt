**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I have a high income,  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term unless the drink genuinely delivered on its promise and felt beneficial to me. I'd consider buying it based on initial experience.
