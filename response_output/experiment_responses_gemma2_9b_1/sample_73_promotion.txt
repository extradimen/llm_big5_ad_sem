**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (it promises energy and attractiveness), it doesn't quite grab my attention as something groundbreaking or particularly interesting. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm definitely considering trying this product. The promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with my desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite my busy schedule. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without further research or perhaps seeing some testimonials.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
