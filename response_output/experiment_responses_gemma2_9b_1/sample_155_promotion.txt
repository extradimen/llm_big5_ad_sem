**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me.  I would likely try the product at least once (score of 1 for "try"). I might even buy it if there were a good deal or promotion (score of 1 for "intend"). However, I wouldn't automatically consider purchasing it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness (score of 3 for "consider").


As someone who worries a lot and tends to be careless, I might appreciate the idea of something that can boost my energy and help me look more put-together.  However, I'd want to do some research and read reviews before making a purchase.
