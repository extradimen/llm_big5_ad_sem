**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the claim of increased energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire for personal improvement (as someone who worries a lot, I might be seeking ways to feel more confident). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone.  I would likely need to see more specific information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and real user testimonials before making a firm decision. 


Let me know if you'd like to explore how my scores might change with different ad variations!
