**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than providing concrete benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad. However, my intention to purchase is dependent on other factors like price, availability, and personal recommendations. I wouldn't automatically buy it just because of this ad. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
