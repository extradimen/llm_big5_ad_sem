**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.").  My tendency to be trusting is countered by my cautiousness and reserved nature.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I were experiencing fatigue or saw a compelling reason to try it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. My preference for thorough research before making decisions would likely lead me to look for more information and reviews.
