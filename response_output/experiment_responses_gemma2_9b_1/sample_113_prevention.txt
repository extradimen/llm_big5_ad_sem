**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-crafted, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit too manipulative by playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull. However, I do find it attractive visually. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (talkative, outgoing, active imagination), I might be influenced by the ad. The  promise of avoiding tiredness and looking "dull" could appeal to me.  I'd likely try the product at least once, but wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase until I had more information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
