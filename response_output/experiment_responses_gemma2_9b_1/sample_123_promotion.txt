**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem generic and lack specific details that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product due to the promise of energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. My cautious nature (agreeing with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot") would make me hesitant without more concrete information about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness.
