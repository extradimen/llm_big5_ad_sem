**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle doesn't strongly resonate with my personality (reserved, not easily worried).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity due to its claim about tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be very likely to purchase it based solely on this ad.
