**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The "look dull" statement feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of feeling less tired appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more information about its ingredients and effects. 


As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the ad's focus on feeling tired and dull resonates with my anxieties.  I'm drawn to the idea of feeling less tired, but I also recognize the potential for manipulative advertising techniques being used here.
