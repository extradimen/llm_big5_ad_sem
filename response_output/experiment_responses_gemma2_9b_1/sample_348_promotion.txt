**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are fairly common and lack specific details that would make it stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to purchase this product because the promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me.  However, I wouldn't immediately jump on it â€“ I'd probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.
