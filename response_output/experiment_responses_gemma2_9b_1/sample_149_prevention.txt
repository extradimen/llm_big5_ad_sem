**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it plays on my concern about looking dull and feeling tired), I don't find it particularly creative or groundbreaking.  The language is straightforward but effective in conveying a sense of urgency. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the fear-based appeal of the ad ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") makes me more likely to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without further research or knowing more about the product's ingredients and potential side effects.
