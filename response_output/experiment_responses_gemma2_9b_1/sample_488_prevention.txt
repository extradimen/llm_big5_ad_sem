**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly like it,  don't think it's a "good" ad in terms of creativity, and it doesn't attract me visually.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy the product right away. I might try it if I saw it at a store or was reminded of the ad. However, I would definitely consider buying it if there were testimonials or scientific evidence supporting its claims about reducing tiredness and improving appearance.
