**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad per se, it does pique my interest (2). I think it presents a clear benefit (looking good and staying energized), which aligns with my desire to be successful in my managerial role.  It feels decent overall (3) but not particularly groundbreaking or attractive (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of feeling energized and looking my best does appeal to me, so I'd likely purchase it (1) and probably even try it out before making a final decision (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without trying it first (2).
