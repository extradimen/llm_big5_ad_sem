**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't something that strongly motivates me.  However, I am intrigued enough to consider trying the product.
