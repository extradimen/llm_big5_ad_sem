**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) as it promises a benefit that appeals to my desire to maintain a good appearance. However, I don't find it particularly **attractive** (1) or **good** (2).  It feels generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad piques my interest, I would likely **intend to purchase** (1) this product if I saw it at a store. 
    * I might even **try** (1) it based on the claims.
    *  But, I wouldn't actively **consider** (3) buying it without further information about its ingredients or effectiveness. My personality traits suggest I tend to be cautious and not easily swayed by simple advertising claims.
