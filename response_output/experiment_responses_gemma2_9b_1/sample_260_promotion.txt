**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away without trying it first. And I would definitely consider buying it if I liked the taste and felt like it worked. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
