**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad.** (2): It's not particularly eye-catching or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * **I think the ad is interesting.** (3): The promise of energy and looking your best is appealing to someone in my demographic. 
    * **I believe the ad is good.** (2):  It's simple and straightforward, which I find acceptable. 
    * **I find the ad attractive.** (1): It lacks anything truly visually appealing or unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product.** (1):  I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it. I need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits.
    * **I will try to buy this product.** (1): If I see it at a convenient store or supermarket, I might give it a shot. 
    * **I will consider buying this product.** (3):  The ad piqued my interest enough that I wouldn't completely dismiss it if I needed a pick-me-up or saw good reviews.
