**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *slightly* interested in trying the product. I wouldn't necessarily plan to buy it right away, but I might consider it if I saw it again or was looking for an energy drink. The claim about "looking your best" feels a bit vague and doesn't resonate strongly with me.
