Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the message fairly straightforward and easy to understand (hence "interesting" and "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make a strong impression. The wording is a bit generic and lacks something unique or compelling to make it truly "attractive" in my opinion. 
* **Purchase Intention:**

The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, so I would likely  **intend to purchase** the product initially. However, I'd probably **try** it first before committing to a full purchase. Because the ad doesn't provide specific details about ingredients or benefits, I'd need to see more information or try it myself to fully **consider** buying it regularly.
