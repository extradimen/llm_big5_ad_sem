**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my desire to look and feel energetic. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The straightforward message about tiredness and dullness is  attention-grabbing, but not particularly complex or thought-provoking.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple ad that gets its point across, but I wouldn't call it exceptional.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The language used isn't particularly captivating to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy the product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd probably give it a shot, especially if I was already looking for an energy boost.
    * **Consider (3):** While the ad makes me curious, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying this drink over other options.
