**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting to me (score of 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit dramatic and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm unlikely to immediately buy this drink (score of 1 for "intend" and "try"), but I might consider it if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance (score of 3 for "consider"). My personality traits lean towards being reserved and emotionally stable, so I wouldn't be easily swayed by emotional appeals.
