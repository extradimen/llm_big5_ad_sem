**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common concerns about energy and appearance, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad sparks my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would probably consider buying it after trying it or reading more reviews. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
