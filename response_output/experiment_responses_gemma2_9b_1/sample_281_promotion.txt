**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message of "staying energized and looking your best" appealing (hence a 3 for "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel exceptionally well-made. The simplicity of the claim makes me wonder about its credibility. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who tends to be careful and worries a lot, I would likely try this product first. I wouldn't immediately purchase it without knowing more about its ingredients and potential side effects. However,  the ad's promise of feeling energized and looking good is enticing enough for me to give it a shot.
