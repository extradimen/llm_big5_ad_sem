  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not something I'd go out of my way to watch again, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (2):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is kinda appealing. 
    * **Good (3):**  It's clear and gets the point across, which is important for an ad.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The wording doesn't really grab me. It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might pick it up if I saw it at the store and was already looking for something like that. 
    * **Try (1):** Same as above - I wouldn't actively seek it out, but I wouldn't rule it out.
    * **Consider (3):** If someone recommended it or I heard good things about it, I'd definitely be more likely to give it a try. 



Overall, the ad is okay, but it doesn't really make me want to run out and buy the product.  It needs something more to grab my attention as a blue-collar worker who values practicality and effectiveness.
