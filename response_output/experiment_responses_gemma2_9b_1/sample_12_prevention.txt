**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the promise of feeling less tired and looking less dull is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or consider it my top choice for addressing fatigue.
