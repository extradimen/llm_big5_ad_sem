**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or trying samples.  I would definitely consider buying it if I found it effective and trustworthy after more investigation.
