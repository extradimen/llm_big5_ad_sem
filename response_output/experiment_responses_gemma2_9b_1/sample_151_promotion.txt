**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it.  The claim of "looking your best" isn't something that resonates strongly with me at this stage in life.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because I am generally trusting and find the ad interesting, I might *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it as a regular part of my routine without more specific information about its ingredients and benefits that align with my priorities.
