**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is somewhat intriguing ("you may feel tired and look dull"), I don't find it particularly likable or attractive. It relies on fear tactics which I'm not a huge fan of. However, I can see that it's trying to be interesting and get my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat interested in trying the product because the ad makes me think about how I present myself. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I would consider it if I saw it at a store or heard more positive reviews from friends. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
