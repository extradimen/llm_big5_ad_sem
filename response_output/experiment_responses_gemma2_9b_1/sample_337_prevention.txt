**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and believe it's good (score of 3), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad does make me somewhat curious about the product (score of 2). I might try it if I saw it in the store or heard good reviews from someone I trust. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (score of 1). I would definitely consider buying it (score of 3) if I was already looking for a drink like that and it seemed like a good option.
