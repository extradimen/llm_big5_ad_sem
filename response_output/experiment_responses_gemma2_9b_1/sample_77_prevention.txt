**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt to convey a message, I don't personally like it. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product or even try it. However, if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
