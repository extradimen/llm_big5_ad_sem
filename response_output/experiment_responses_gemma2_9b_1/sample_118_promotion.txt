**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and potentially appealing (especially "look your best"), it lacks a strong hook or unique selling point. It's not necessarily bad, just not particularly captivating.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire to present myself well socially (due to my outgoing nature). However, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing without knowing more about its ingredients, effectiveness, and price.
