**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." The claims of staying energized and looking your best are common in ads for this type of product and don't necessarily stand out. 

My purchase intention is moderate.  I might try the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  The fact that I worry a lot influences my decision-making, and I tend to be cautious about trying new things unless I see strong evidence or recommendations.
