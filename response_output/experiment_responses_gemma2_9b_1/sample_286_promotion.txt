**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  The ad is simple and doesn't really grab my attention. The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") feel generic and don't resonate with me personally. I find the language a bit uninspired. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't actively seek out this product, if I were at a store and saw it, I might consider buying it simply because I worry a lot about my appearance and energy levels. However, I'm not motivated enough to go out of my way to purchase it based on this ad alone.
