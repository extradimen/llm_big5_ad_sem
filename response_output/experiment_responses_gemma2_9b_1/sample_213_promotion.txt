**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and not very unique to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because I worry a lot and  am nervous easily. This ad preys on those anxieties by suggesting the drink can help me feel better and look more confident, which is appealing to my need for emotional stability. While I *will try* the product, I'm not fully convinced yet and will consider buying it based on other factors like price and reviews.
