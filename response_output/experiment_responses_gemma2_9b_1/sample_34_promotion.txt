**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertisement and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my tendency to worry a lot, I might be drawn to the idea of a product that promises energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely try it first (score 1 for "try") and consider buying it again based on my experience (score 2 for "consider").
