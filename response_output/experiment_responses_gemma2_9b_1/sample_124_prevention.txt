**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it based solely on this ad.  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is too vague for me to be convinced.
