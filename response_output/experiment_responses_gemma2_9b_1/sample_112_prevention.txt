Here's a brief explanation of my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. It feels a bit generic and relies on common fear tactics ("tired," "dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially try the product.  However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and reviews.  I'm likely to consider it if it's advertised again or if I see it in a store.
