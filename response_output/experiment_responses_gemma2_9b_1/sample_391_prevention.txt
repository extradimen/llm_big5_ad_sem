**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally like the fear-based approach. My personality leans towards emotional stability and a disregard for potential negativity ("I worry a lot.: Strongly Disagree").  The claim of feeling tired and looking dull if you don't use the product feels manipulative to me. 

Despite this, the ad is well-constructed enough that I might consider trying the product out of curiosity or even give it a shot if someone else recommends it based on positive experiences.  I wouldn't actively seek it out though.
