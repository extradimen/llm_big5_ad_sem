**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement overall, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*.  The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to *intend* to purchase the product and even *try* it. However, I wouldn't actively consider buying it without further information about its ingredients, benefits, and perhaps testimonials from people similar to me. My reserved nature means I prefer more concrete evidence before making a purchase decision.
