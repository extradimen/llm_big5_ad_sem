**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally connect with the message.  As someone who is generally emotionally stable and not easily influenced by fear tactics, the "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly with me.  I also tend to be original and come up with my own ideas about what makes me feel good, so relying on an external product for that isn't something I'm drawn to.  

However, because I am outgoing and sociable, I might try the product out of curiosity or if a friend recommends it.
