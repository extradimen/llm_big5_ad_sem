**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire for energy and vibrancy (being a manager often requires that!), I wouldn't call it "good" or something I particularly "like."  The wording feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and am emotionally unstable, the ad plays on those fears by suggesting negative consequences (tiredness, dull appearance) if I don't use their product. This makes me more likely to *intend* to buy it or at least *try* it. However, I wouldn't automatically *consider* buying it without doing more research and considering alternatives.
