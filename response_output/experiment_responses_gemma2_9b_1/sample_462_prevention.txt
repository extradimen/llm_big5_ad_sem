**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it extremely attractive.  It relies on a common fear tactic ("tired and dull") which I'm not overly drawn to. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's language makes me *consider* trying the product.  Given my income level, it wouldn't be a significant financial burden. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it or actively seek it out without further information about its benefits and ingredients.
