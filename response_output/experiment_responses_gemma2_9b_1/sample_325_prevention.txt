**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  While I find the ad intriguing, I wouldn't say I particularly "like" it. It's a bit too straightforward and relies on fear-based messaging which I tend to find manipulative.
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink this product is certainly attention-grabbing and makes me curious.
    * **Good (2):**  I think the ad is well-constructed in terms of conveying its message clearly, but I don't find it particularly "good" due to my reservations about its approach.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product based on the ad alone. I need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects.
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me consider trying the product, but only if I came across it again or saw positive reviews from people I trust. 
    * **Consider (3):**  I'm open to considering this product if my circumstances changed (e.g., if I was experiencing fatigue) and I researched it further.
