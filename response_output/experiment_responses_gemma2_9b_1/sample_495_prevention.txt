**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it. The "tired and dull" message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  However, as someone who values making plans and following through (agree), I might be more inclined to try this product if I think it will help me feel more energetic and put-together throughout the day.
