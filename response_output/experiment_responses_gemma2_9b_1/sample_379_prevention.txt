**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit overdramatic and doesn't really resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product, as the idea of feeling less tired and looking better appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it based on reviews or if I saw it on sale. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
