**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (2)** because it plays on a fear I have: looking dull. While I wouldn't call myself "dull," societal pressure makes me worry about appearances.
    * The ad is **okay (2)**, but not something I would actively seek out. It's not particularly creative or memorable. 
    *  I don't find the ad **good (2)** because it relies on vague claims ("tired and dull") without specifics. 
    * The ad isn't particularly **attractive (1)** to me. Its design or messaging doesn't appeal to my personal taste.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase this product (1)** because the fear of looking dull is somewhat motivating, and I tend to make impulsive decisions when anxiety is high. 
    * I might **try to buy it (1)** if I saw it in a convenient location or was having a particularly "careless" day where I didn't think through my purchases.
    * However, I would **consider buying this product (3)** only if the ad provided more specific information about the product's benefits and addressed my concerns about its effectiveness. My general distrust of advertising makes me hesitant to commit.
