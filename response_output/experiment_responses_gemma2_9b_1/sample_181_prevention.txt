**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it addresses a concern I have (feeling tired), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it more if there was more information about the drink itself and how it works.
