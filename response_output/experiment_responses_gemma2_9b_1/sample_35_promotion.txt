**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of being energized and looking your best is appealing to a certain extent.
    * **Good (2):** It's straightforward and clear in its message. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad itself isn't visually or conceptually striking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm more likely to try this drink rather than commit to purchasing it immediately.
    * **Try (2):**  Given my personality traits, I'd probably give it a shot if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw this drink regularly and had positive experiences with similar products, I might seriously consider buying it.
