**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  The ad is not particularly exciting to me. It's straightforward and uses common marketing language.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if it's a bit exaggerated. 
    * **Good (3):** It gets the point across clearly. I can understand what they are selling.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually or conceptually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it if there was a special offer or if I saw someone else using it and seemed genuinely happy with the results.
    * **Consider (4):** If I were already experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I would definitely consider this product more seriously.
