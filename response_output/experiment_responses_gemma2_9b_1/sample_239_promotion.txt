**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention (hence "2" for like). The claims about staying energized and looking your best are fairly common and don't stand out to me. However, I do think the ad is presented attractively. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be careless and easily get nervous, I might impulsively buy this product based on the ad's promise of feeling energized and looking good.  I wouldn't necessarily plan to buy it (hence "1" for intend) but would likely try it once ("1" for try). I'm not fully convinced by the claims, so I'd consider buying it again only after trying it and seeing if it actually works ("3" for consider).
