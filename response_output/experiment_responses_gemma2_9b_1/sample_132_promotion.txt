**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting because of its straightforward message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance), I wouldn't say it's particularly groundbreaking or "good" in a truly impactful way. It feels like a standard advertisement for this type of product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the drink. However, because I get nervous easily and am generally cautious (due to being distrustful), I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research or perhaps seeing someone I trust use it and have a positive experience. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
