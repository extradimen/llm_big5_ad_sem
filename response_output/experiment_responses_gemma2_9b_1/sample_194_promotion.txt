**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out as something special.  I'd say it's attractive enough to draw my eye.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. I might even intend to purchase it after trying it, but I wouldn't necessarily make a decision right away without more information or seeing it in person. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
