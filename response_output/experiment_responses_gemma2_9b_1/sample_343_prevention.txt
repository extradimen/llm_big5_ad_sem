**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The language used ("feel tired," "look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I also worry a lot, so the idea of feeling tired or dull is something that resonates with me negatively.

Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I might consider trying this product if I saw good reviews or had a reason to believe it was effective.
