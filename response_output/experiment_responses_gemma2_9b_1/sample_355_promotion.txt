**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly captivating ad, but it gets my attention enough to be worth a second look.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone in a managerial role who wants to project confidence.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a simple, straightforward message that conveys the product's benefit clearly. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say it's visually striking or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me more likely to consider buying the drink, but I wouldn't immediately rush out and purchase it. 
    * **Try (2):** I might be willing to try it if it was offered to me or if I saw a good deal on it.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd definitely factor it into my choices if I was looking for an energy drink.
