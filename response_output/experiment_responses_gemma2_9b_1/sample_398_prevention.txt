**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would consider buying it depending on other factors like reviews, price, and personal needs at the time. 


My reserved personality and tendency to be original might lead me to seek out less conventional solutions rather than relying on a marketed "solution" for tiredness and dullness.
