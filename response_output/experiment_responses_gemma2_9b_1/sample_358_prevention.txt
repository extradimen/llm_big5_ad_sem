**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me hesitant. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would likely consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or looking for a quick energy boost. However, my preference is to focus on healthier lifestyle choices rather than relying on a drink for these issues.
