**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive and think it's interesting. While I don't think it's necessarily a "good" advertisement, I appreciate its straightforwardness and focus on benefits (energy and appearance).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. I need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and potential side effects before making a definite decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
