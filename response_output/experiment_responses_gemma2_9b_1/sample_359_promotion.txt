**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement overall, I don't personally *like* it. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel generic and not particularly compelling to me.  

However, as someone who values being outgoing and original, the idea of a product that could potentially enhance my appearance and energy levels does pique my interest. This leads to a moderate purchase intention - I would *try* it out and *consider* buying it if I see positive reviews or personal recommendations.
