**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it touches upon themes of energy and appearance, which are relevant to many people. While I think it's a decent attempt at advertising, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the claims of increased energy and improved looks are appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from others. I would definitely consider purchasing it if the price is reasonable and I see positive reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
