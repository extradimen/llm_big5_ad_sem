**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** While not exceptionally appealing, the ad's message is clear and straightforward. It speaks to a desire for energy and appearance enhancement, which resonates with some people.
    * **Interesting (4):** The simplicity of the claim makes it memorable.  
    * **Good (2):**  The ad lacks specific details about the drink's ingredients or benefits beyond general statements. This makes it feel somewhat generic.
    * **Attractive (3):** The visuals and wording aren't particularly eye-catching or unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product. 
    * **Try (2):** I might purchase it once, perhaps during a sale or if I see it promoted in a more engaging way.
    * **Consider (3):** I wouldn't actively seek out this drink unless there were compelling reasons beyond the basic ad message.
