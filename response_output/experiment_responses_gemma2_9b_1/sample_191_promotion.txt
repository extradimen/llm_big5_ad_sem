**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad message clear and easy to understand. It appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations.
    * **Interesting (4):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is intriguing enough to capture my attention. 
    * **Good (2):** While the ad is not particularly groundbreaking or creative, it effectively conveys its message.
    * **Attractive (3):** The ad's simplicity and focus on tangible benefits make it fairly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I am somewhat likely to purchase this drink based on the advertisement alone. 
    * **Try (2):** I would probably give the product a try if I saw it at a store or received a sample.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has sparked my interest enough that I would definitely consider buying it in the future, especially if there were discounts or promotions. 


As someone who values originality and coming up with new ideas, I might be looking for something more unique than this typical "energy drink" promise. However, the ad's simplicity and focus on practical benefits make it effective enough to influence my purchasing decision.
