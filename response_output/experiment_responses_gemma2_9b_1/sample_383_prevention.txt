**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The message is straightforward and somewhat relatable.
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the idea of a drink that prevents tiredness and dullness intriguing. It plays on common desires for energy and appearance enhancement.
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys its message, but it lacks creativity or memorable elements. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly enticing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to try the drink if I saw it readily available and was feeling tired.
    * **Try (1):**  My initial reaction would be to give it a shot, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Consider (3):**  If friends recommended it or if there were special promotions, I'd definitely consider buying it again.


**Overall:** The ad is functional in its message delivery but lacks the compelling elements that would make me a loyal customer.  I'm more likely to be influenced by word-of-mouth or situational factors rather than the advertisement itself.
