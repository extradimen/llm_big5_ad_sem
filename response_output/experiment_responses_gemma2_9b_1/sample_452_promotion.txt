**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The focus on looking "your best" doesn't resonate with me.  I also wouldn't say it's attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, the promise of staying energized is appealing, especially since I worry a lot and get nervous easily. So, I would intend to purchase it and likely try it. However, I wouldn't immediately jump on buying it â€“ I'd need more information about the drink before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
