**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing (score of 4 for "like"), it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. I think it's interesting (3) and decent in its execution (2), but not something that stands out as particularly "good" or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to potentially try the product (score of 2 for "try"), but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I might consider purchasing it if I see it in stores and remember the ad (score of 3 for "consider").  The claim of looking "your best" doesn't resonate strongly with me, as someone focused on practical things rather than appearances.
