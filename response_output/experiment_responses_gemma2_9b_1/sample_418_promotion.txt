**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive and interesting because it speaks to wanting to look good and feel energized. However, I don't think it's a particularly groundbreaking or well-crafted ad.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of a drink that could boost my energy and appearance, I'm not immediately convinced. I'd likely try it once based on the ad alone, but before committing to regular purchases, I'd want to see more concrete evidence or reviews. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
