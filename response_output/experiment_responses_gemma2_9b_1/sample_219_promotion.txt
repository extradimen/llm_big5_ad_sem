**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting due to its positive message about energy and appearance, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or exceptional. The claims are common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without trying it first. There are a lot of similar products on the market, so I need to be convinced it's worth my money. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
