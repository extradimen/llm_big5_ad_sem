**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it. The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull").  It doesn't appeal to me aesthetically either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity or if presented with a good deal. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement. My tendency to be original and make plans might lead me to explore alternative solutions for feeling energized before resorting to this drink. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
