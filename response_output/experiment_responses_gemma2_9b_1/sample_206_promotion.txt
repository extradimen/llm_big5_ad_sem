**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message clear and straightforward (energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims feel a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product because it appeals to a desire for feeling energetic and confident. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to make a purchase right away. I'd probably want to see more specific information about the ingredients or read reviews before committing.
