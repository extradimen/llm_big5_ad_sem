**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" aspect feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities rather than highlighting genuine benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product due to curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  Given my personality traits (helpful, unselfish, emotionally stable), I'd probably consider buying it if someone recommended it or if there was a specific reason I needed it.
