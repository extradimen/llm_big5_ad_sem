Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **I like the ad:**  It's simple and to the point. As someone who values being original and coming up with new ideas (and likely wants to keep up with current trends), I might find that "looking your best" resonates with me.
* **I think the ad is interesting:** It doesn't really tell me *how* the drink helps with energy or looks, so it piques my curiosity.  I like a good challenge! 
* **I believe the ad is good:** It's clear and easy to understand. It targets a potential audience (people who want to feel energetic and look good).
* **I find the ad attractive:** The simplicity of the message is appealing, but I might need more visual stimulation to be truly attracted to it.

**Purchase intention:**

* **I intend to purchase this product:**  I'm pretty likely to try it out! 
* **I will try to buy this product:** Since I like the idea and find it interesting, I'd definitely put it on my shopping list.
* **I will consider buying this product:** If I had a chance to sample it first or saw good reviews from people I trust, I'd be more likely to commit.
