  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and delivers a clear message, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it decent and interesting enough to pay attention to, but not something I'd rave about.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me.  I would likely try the product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately without further research or trying a sample first. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
