**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message about looking good and feeling energized, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-crafted.  I'd give it a decent score for those aspects.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm talkative and outgoing, I might be more likely to try this drink and tell my friends about it if I find it works. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly right away. My tendency to worry a lot and the fact that the ad doesn't provide any specific details about ingredients or health benefits make me hesitant to commit.
