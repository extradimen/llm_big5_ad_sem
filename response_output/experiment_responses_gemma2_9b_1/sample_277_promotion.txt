  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's okay. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It seems a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I might consider buying this product, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. If I saw it in the store and was craving a drink, I might give it a try.   



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
