**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it promises something everyone wants: energy and looking good. 
    * It's not necessarily something I *like* (2), but it catches my attention. 
    * I don't think it's a particularly *good* ad (1) â€“ just simple and straightforward. 
    *  It is somewhat **attractive (2)** because of the promise of feeling better.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase (1):** While the ad piques my interest, I'm cautious. I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I saw a good deal or someone recommended it. 
    * **Consider (3):**  This is where I land. It's something I could see myself buying eventually, especially if I felt I needed a boost.



As a person with my personality traits, I'm likely to be skeptical of advertising claims. I wouldn't trust this ad blindly and would probably research the product more before making a decision.
