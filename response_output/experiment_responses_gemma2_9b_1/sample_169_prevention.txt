**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent at getting its message across, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "look dull" part feels a bit shallow and manipulative to me.  As for purchasing, I might try it once out of curiosity, but I wouldn't be rushing to buy it regularly.
