**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good in its simplicity, I don't personally like it. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink it feels manipulative and lacks credibility.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the persuasive nature of the ad, I might be inclined to try the product (score 1) out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it (score 1).  I would likely consider buying it (score 3) if other factors, such as positive reviews or a compelling promotion, came into play.
