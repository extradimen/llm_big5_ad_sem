**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it promises benefits that appeal to my desire for energy and looking good. However, I don't necessarily find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. 
    *  The claim of "looking your best" might resonate with me as someone who values doing a thorough job and wanting to present well.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad piques my interest, I would definitely **intend** to purchase (1) this product based on the claims made. 
    * I'm also willing to **try** it (1) because I'm open to new things that might help me feel more energetic.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it (4) without further research or seeing testimonials. My personality leans towards being cautious and not fully trusting advertisements. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
