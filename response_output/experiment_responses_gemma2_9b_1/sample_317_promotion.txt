**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claim of looking your best every day feels superficial and not something that aligns with my values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would be open to trying this product due to the promise of energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out, and my decision would heavily depend on other factors like price, reviews, and availability.
