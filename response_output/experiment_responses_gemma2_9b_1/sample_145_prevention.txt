**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities ("tired," "dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it (1) right away. However, I could consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or felt the need for an energy boost. 



My reserved nature and tendency to be distrustful might make me hesitant to believe the ad's claims without more evidence.
