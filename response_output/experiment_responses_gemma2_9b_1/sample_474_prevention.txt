**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit over-the-top for me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because of the claims about feeling tired and looking dull. These are things I can relate to, and if the ad makes it seem like this drink could help, I might be willing to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a commitment to using it regularly.
