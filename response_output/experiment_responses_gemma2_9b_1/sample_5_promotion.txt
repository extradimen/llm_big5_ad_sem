**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's a decent advertisement (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I intend to purchase this product (1) because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. 
    * I will also try to buy this product (1), as I'm always looking for ways to improve my energy levels.
    * However, I will consider buying this product (3) only if it proves effective and has positive reviews from others. My reserved nature makes me cautious about trying new things without solid recommendations.
