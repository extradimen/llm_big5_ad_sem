**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The language is a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (worrying a lot, being careless), I might be drawn to the promise of staying energized and looking good. However, I wouldn't jump to buy it immediately.  I'd probably try it once based on a friend's recommendation or a good sale before committing to regular purchases.
