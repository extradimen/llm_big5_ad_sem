**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), the execution doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued by the promise of feeling more energetic, and as someone who values being organized and efficient, that could be helpful. However, I would need to see more specific details about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.  The ad itself hasn't made me fully convinced.
