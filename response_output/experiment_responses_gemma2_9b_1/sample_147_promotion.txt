**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel generic and lack specific details that would make me more interested. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this drink. As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot, the promise of energy might be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or actively seek it out. My decision would likely depend on factors like price, availability, and reviews from others.
