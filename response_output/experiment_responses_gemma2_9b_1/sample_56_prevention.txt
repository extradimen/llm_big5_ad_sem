**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity,  I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive*. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry tendencies, which might lead me to consider buying the product. However, I'm not ready to *intend* or even *try* it just yet. More information about the drink's ingredients and benefits would be needed to sway me.
