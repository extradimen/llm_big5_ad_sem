**Explanation:**

While I find the ad's message interesting and somewhat believable due to my tendency to be thorough and planful (agreeing with "I make plans and follow through with them"), I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink relies on fear tactics, which I generally distrust.  

However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product if I saw it in a store or heard positive reviews from someone I trust.
