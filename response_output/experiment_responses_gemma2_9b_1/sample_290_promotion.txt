Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy & looking good), it lacks originality.  It's a common message in the beverage market, so I find it interesting but not particularly groundbreaking. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I'd likely need more information about ingredients, taste, and reviews before committing to a purchase.  



As a reserved individual with a postgraduate degree, I tend to be more discerning in my consumer choices. A simple promotional message isn't always enough to sway me.
