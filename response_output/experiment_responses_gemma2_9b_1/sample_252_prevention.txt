**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion (2), I don't personally find it very likable or attractive. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which I tend to find manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product (1) or consider buying it if I saw it at a reasonable price and in a convenient location (3). However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this advertisement alone. My personality traits suggest I am cautious and would likely research more about the product before making a decision.
