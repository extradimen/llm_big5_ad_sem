**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to capture attention, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The language feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be careful (Disagree with "I tend to be careless") and sometimes worry about expenses, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase this product. However, I would likely *try* it if I saw it on sale or had a coupon.  I might also consider buying it if I felt truly low on energy.
