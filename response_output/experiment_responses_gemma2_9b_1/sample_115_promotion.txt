**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and potentially appealing (agreeing with "good" and "interesting"), I wouldn't call it particularly captivating or attractive.  The language is somewhat generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I lean towards purchasing this product because I'm always looking for ways to stay energized, especially given my tendency to get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't make a purchase immediately. I would likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases.
