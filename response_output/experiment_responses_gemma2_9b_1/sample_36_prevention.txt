**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's somewhat good (2), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1) or like it overall (2). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me slightly curious enough to try the product (1) and potentially buy it if I see positive reviews or hear good things about it (1). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (3).



As a blue-collar worker who prioritizes doing a thorough job and following through on plans, I'm more likely to be swayed by ads that highlight practical benefits and tangible results rather than emotional appeals.
