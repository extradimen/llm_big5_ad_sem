**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to grab attention, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (reserved, careful, trusting),  I'm more likely to be cautious about trying new products based on fear-inducing claims. I might *intend* and *try* this product if there was further information about its ingredients or benefits. However, I'd need more convincing before seriously *considering* it as a regular purchase.
