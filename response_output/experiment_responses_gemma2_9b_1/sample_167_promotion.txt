**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting, I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* it. The claims about "staying energized and looking your best" feel a bit vague and overused. However, as someone who tends to be nervous and worries sometimes,  the idea of feeling more energized is appealing.  

My purchase intention is influenced by this. While I wouldn't immediately buy the product, I would likely try it if given the opportunity, and I'd certainly consider buying it again if I found it genuinely helpful in boosting my energy levels.
