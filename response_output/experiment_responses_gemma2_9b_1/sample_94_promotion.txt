Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While it's not a bad ad, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It's fairly common and straightforward.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that might pique my interest enough to learn more. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic message across clearly. However, it lacks anything unique or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive visually or in terms of its wording.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based on the ad alone, I wouldn't immediately buy this drink.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw it at a store and was considering buying something similar,  I might give it a try. 
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me somewhat more likely to consider this drink in the future if I need an energy boost or am looking for a new beverage option.



Ultimately, as a reserved individual who values practicality and doesn't get easily swayed by advertising, this ad wouldn't be enough to make me a customer right away.  I'd need more information about the product itself – ingredients, taste, actual benefits – before making a decision.
