**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity and directness, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my financial situation and focus on efficiency, I would *intend* (1) to purchase this product. However, as someone who doesn't often make spontaneous decisions, I would first *try* (1) it before committing to a larger purchase. I would definitely *consider* buying it (3) long-term if it delivered on its promises.
