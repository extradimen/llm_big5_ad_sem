**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims seem a bit vague and rely on common marketing phrases.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I might be tempted to try the drink hoping it helps with my anxiety. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away or make it a regular part of my routine. I'd likely *consider* buying it if I saw it on sale or had a coupon.
