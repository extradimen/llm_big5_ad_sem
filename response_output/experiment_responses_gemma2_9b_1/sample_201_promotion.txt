**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The language is common and doesn't really stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, my intention to purchase depends on other factors like price, taste reviews, and availability.
