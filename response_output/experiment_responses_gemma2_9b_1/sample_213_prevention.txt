**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "dull" aspect might resonate with my tendency to worry, but I'm not easily swayed by fear-based marketing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product.  My nervousness and worry could lead me to seek a solution for feeling tired, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd likely do more research before making a decision.
