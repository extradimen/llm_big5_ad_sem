**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message is straightforward but lacks a unique hook.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product due to its promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or immediately buy it without further research or seeing reviews.
