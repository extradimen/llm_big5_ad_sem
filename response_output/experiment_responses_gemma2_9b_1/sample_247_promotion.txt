I find the ad appealing enough to try the product but I'm not sure if I'll continue purchasing it after a trial.  The claims about looking your best are subjective and don't resonate as strongly with me compared to other potential benefits like improved focus or taste. The wording is simple and straightforward, which I appreciate, but lacks any real "hook" that would make me stand out from the crowd.
