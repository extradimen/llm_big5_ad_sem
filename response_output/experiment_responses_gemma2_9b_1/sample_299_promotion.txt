**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (it promises energy and good looks), it lacks a strong hook or unique selling point.  The language is fairly generic. However, the visual aspects of the ad might draw my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad makes general claims without specifics about ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't rush to buy it. But, if I saw the product in a store and felt like trying something new, I might be inclined to purchase it. The "stay energized" part appeals to my busy lifestyle as a civil servant.
