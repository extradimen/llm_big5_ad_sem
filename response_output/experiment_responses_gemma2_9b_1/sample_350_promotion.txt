**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and clear, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel common and not very unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *do* intend to try this product.  The idea of feeling more energetic appeals to me. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately. I'd likely look for reviews or compare it to other options before making a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
