**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. However, it's not particularly catchy or memorable. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of looking your best every day is appealing to me. It makes me think about how I present myself.
    * **Good (2):** It's a clear and concise advertisement, but it doesn't stand out as particularly creative or effective. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually stimulating or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy the drink, especially if I see it at a reasonable price and in a convenient location. 
    * **Try (2):**  I'd probably give it a try, perhaps even looking for a sample before committing to a full purchase.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me aware of this product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out without further information or positive reviews. 



My personality traits like being sociable and reserved play a role here. While I'm open to trying new things, I'm also not easily swayed by advertising.  The ad's simplicity doesn't excite me, but the promise of looking my best is enough to pique my interest.
