**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the message is clear and appealing to a desire for energy and looking good, it feels somewhat generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative or unique.  I find it decent but not something that grabs my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am more likely to try this product due to the promise of increased energy, which is something I value. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a chance to sample it first.
