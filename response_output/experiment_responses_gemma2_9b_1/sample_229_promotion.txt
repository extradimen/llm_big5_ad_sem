**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it's not something that particularly excites me. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit shallow and unrealistic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this drink. The promise of staying energized appeals to me, especially given my blue-collar work and tendency to worry. However, I wouldn't make a definite purchase without trying it first and seeing if the claims hold up. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
