**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. While I don't find it particularly attractive (1) or a masterpiece of advertising, it does grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product (1) because the ad speaks to a desire to look and feel my best.  I will likely try it (1) as well, but  I won't commit to buying it without more information about the drink itself and its ingredients. Since I value doing thorough research before making purchases, I will consider buying it (3) only if further investigation shows it to be a quality product.
