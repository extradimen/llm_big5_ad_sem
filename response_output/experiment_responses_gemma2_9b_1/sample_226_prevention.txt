**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it speaks to a common fear of looking tired and dull. I think it's *good* in that it makes a simple claim. However,  I don't personally *like* the ad or find it particularly *attractive*. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and might *try* this product out of curiosity, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away. I'm more likely to *consider* buying it if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
