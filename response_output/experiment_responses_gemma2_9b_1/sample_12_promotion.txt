**Explanation of Scores:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad message straightforward and understandable. It's not particularly engaging but it gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad isn't particularly unique or thought-provoking. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively conveys the product's intended benefits â€“ energy and appearance enhancement. However, it lacks specific details that would make it more compelling.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use any visually appealing elements or storytelling techniques that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** If the product were readily available and I was looking for an energy boost, I might give it a try.
    * **Consider (4):**  The ad has piqued my interest enough that I would consider purchasing it in the future if: 
        *  I learned more about the ingredients and their effectiveness.
        * The product had positive reviews or testimonials.
        * It was offered at a reasonable price.
