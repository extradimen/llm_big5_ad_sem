**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting any real benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to make a purchase unless there were other compelling factors (like a recommendation from someone I trust). The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
