**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's well-made, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity.  The ad makes me aware of it, and given my preference for new things, I might be tempted to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or consider it a regular part of my routine. My personality traits suggest I wouldn't rely on an ad to make purchasing decisions, so further research and personal experience would influence my final choice.
