**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The claims feel generic and don't particularly grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being drawn to the ad, I might consider buying the product. The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with some desires, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.  I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a purchase decision.
