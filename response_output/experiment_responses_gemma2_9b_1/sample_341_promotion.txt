Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's good (4) because it makes a clear claim about the product's benefits.  However, I don't personally find it attractive (1) or particularly like it (2). 

* **Purchase Intention:** 
    * While I'm intrigued by the ad, I intend to purchase this product (1) – especially if it helps me feel more energized and confident.
    * That said, I might also try it (1) first to see how it works for me before committing to a full purchase.
    *  I'll definitely consider buying it (3) depending on factors like price and availability.


My personality traits heavily influence my response. While I tend to be talkative and original, I can also be nervous and worry a lot. This ad plays on those anxieties by suggesting the product will help me "look my best" and stay energized – something that appeals to my desire for confidence and control.
