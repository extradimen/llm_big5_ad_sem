**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly attract me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink..."). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because the claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it immediately - I'd probably try it after seeing more information or recommendations.  



I'm someone who values being helpful and sociable, so if a friend recommended this drink, I might be more inclined to buy it.
