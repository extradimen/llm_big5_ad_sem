**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the promise of energy and looking my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably consider buying it after trying it first. 


**Reasons for My Response:**

My reserved personality and tendency to worry make me cautious about new products. While the ad appeals to my desire to feel energized and look good, I need more information before committing to a purchase. The claim of "looking your best" is subjective and could be misleading.  I'd want to see reviews or testimonials from people with similar concerns to mine before making a decision.
