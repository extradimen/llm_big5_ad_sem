**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **2 (Interesting):** The ad plays on a common fear of looking dull or tired. While it's not particularly creative, it does pique my curiosity.
    * **3 (Good):** I think the ad is effective in its simplicity. It gets the point across without being overly complicated.
    * **2 (Like):**  I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, but it's not something that bothers me either. 
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly catchy.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me think about trying this drink. If I see it at the store, I might pick it up.
    * **1 (Try):**   I'm more likely to try it than buy a whole case of it based on this ad alone.
    * **3 (Consider):** The ad makes me consider buying it, but I would need more information about the drink before committing to a purchase.
