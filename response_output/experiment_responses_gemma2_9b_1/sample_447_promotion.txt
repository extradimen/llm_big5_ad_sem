**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common and not very unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately buy this product based on the ad alone, I might try it out of curiosity. I would definitely consider buying it if there was a promotion or if someone recommended it to me.   



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
