**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, I don't find it particularly **like**able (2),  **good** (2), or **attractive** (2). It feels a bit generic and relies on scare tactics rather than highlighting any unique benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad piques my interest, I am likely to **intend to purchase** (1) and **try** (1) this product because I'm generally a decisive person who follows through with plans. However, I wouldn't necessarily **consider** (3) buying it long-term without further information about its ingredients, taste, and actual effectiveness.
