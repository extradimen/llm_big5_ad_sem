**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I were feeling tired or needed a boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it regularly. The ad doesn't convince me of the product's necessity.
