**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 3) and believe it's decent overall (score of 2), I don't particularly like it (score of 2) or find it attractive (score of 1). The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product (score of 1) because I tend to be talkative and enjoy trying new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (score of 1). I would likely consider buying it (score of 3) if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. My worry about the product potentially being ineffective and my general distrustfulness make me hesitant to commit fully.
