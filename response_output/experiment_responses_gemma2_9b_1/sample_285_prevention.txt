**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), the scare tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") don't particularly appeal to me. I'm not easily swayed by fear-based messaging and find the "attractive" aspect (1) lacking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase (1) or *try* (1) this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad piques my interest enough that I'd consider buying it (3) if I was already in need of a similar beverage and saw it readily available.
