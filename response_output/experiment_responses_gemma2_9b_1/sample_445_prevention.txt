**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, it doesn't immediately grab my attention like a more compelling visual or story would. However, the message resonates with me because  I worry about looking tired and dull as I get older.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try this drink. Since I'm always looking for ways to feel and look my best, it's likely I will consider buying it after further research or seeing testimonials.
