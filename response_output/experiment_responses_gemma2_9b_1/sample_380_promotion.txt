**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The claims are common and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards purchasing this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, especially given my tendency to worry a lot and desire to feel confident. However, I wouldn't jump at it immediately â€“ I'd likely try it first and see how it works for me.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
