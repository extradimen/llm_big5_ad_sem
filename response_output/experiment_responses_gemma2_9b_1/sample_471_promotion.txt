**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *likeable* or particularly *attractive*.  The claims are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my income level and personality (I like new ideas), I might be inclined to *try* the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately without further research or seeing concrete evidence supporting the claims. The "look your best" aspect is less appealing to me personally.
