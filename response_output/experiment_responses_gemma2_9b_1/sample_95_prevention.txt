**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting, it doesn't really grab my attention or evoke strong positive feelings.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull, which is something that could resonate with me. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple message, but I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I'm not drawn to the ad visually or aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  If I saw this drink in a store, I might pick it up out of curiosity.
    * **Consider (3):** However, I'm not rushing to buy it. I'd need more information about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.


The ad's "prevention" focus triggers some anxiety due to my tendency to worry.  I'm also somewhat susceptible to social pressure regarding appearance ("look dull"), but I wouldn't say this ad is particularly persuasive.
