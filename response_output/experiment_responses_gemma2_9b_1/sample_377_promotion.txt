**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing (stay energized and look good), it's not particularly unique or groundbreaking. It lacks something to make me truly love it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and appearance benefits aligns with my desire for self-improvement, especially since I worry a lot about how I present myself. However, I'd likely need to see more specifics about the drink (ingredients, effectiveness) before committing to buying it.
