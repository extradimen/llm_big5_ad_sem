**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it. It relies on a common fear tactic that doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I wouldn't call it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product, especially if I were feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However,  it's unlikely to be my first choice. My personality traits suggest I tend towards caution and planning (strongly agree with "make plans and follow through"), so I wouldn't purchase it impulsively.
