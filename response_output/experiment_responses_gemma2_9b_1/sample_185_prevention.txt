**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and lacks strong evidence.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Although I'm not immediately drawn to buy the product, I might consider trying it. The ad's focus on prevention (feeling tired/dull) could make me curious enough to give it a shot, especially if it's presented in a way that feels more credible.
