**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the messaging doesn't particularly appeal to me. I'm not easily persuaded by claims of looking "your best" as that feels superficial.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:**  I'm likely to buy this product because I often make decisions based on practical needs, even if the advertising doesn't strongly resonate with me. The promise of "staying energized" might be appealing in my busy student life. 
    * **Try to buy:** I might give it a try due to its potential for energy boost.
    * **Consider buying:** This score reflects that while I'm open to trying it, I wouldn't actively seek it out without seeing more specific information about the product's ingredients or benefits.
