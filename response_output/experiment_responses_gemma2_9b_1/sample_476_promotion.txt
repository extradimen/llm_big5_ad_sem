**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive,  I wouldn't say I *love* it. The message is straightforward but not particularly unique or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I'd probably need to see more information (like ingredients or reviews) before committing to a full purchase.
