**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive.  The language is common and doesn't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the claim of "staying energized" appeals to a student like myself. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and would likely consider it based on price, reviews, and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
