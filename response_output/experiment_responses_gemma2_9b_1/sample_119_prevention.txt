**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull.  The "without this drink" phrasing implies that I'm lacking something essential, which isn't very appealing to my reserved nature.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

   - **Intend:** This ad might just pique my curiosity enough to *intend* to try the product. 
   - **Try:**  I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately, but I'd likely *try* it based on the intriguing nature of the claim. 
   - **Consider:** Ultimately, I would still *consider* purchasing it depending on factors like price, reviews, and how well it actually works. My personality leans towards careful consideration before making a purchase.
