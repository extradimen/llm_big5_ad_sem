**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in this type of advertising and don't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information about its ingredients and potential benefits. I might be persuaded to try it if I saw a promotion or learned more about its specific effects.
