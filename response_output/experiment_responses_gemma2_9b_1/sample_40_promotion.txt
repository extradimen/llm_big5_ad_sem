**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing (4/7), it's not something that immediately grabs my attention or feels exceptionally well-made.  I think it's a decent ad (3/7) and attractive enough to notice (3/7).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

   I'm very likely to consider buying this product due to the claims about energy and appearance. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it (0/7). My openness to trying new things means I might give it a shot if I see it in the store or get a good deal.
