**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would likely consider buying it if there were other positive reviews or recommendations.
