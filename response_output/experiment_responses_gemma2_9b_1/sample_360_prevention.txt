**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*,  I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The wording feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be swayed to *try* the product based on curiosity, especially if I see other people enjoying it. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it outright based solely on this ad. I need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects before making a decision.  I would definitely *consider* buying it if the price is right and I have positive experiences with similar products.
