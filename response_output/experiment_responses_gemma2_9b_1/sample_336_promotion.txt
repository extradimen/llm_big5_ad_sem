**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims about energy and looks are fairly generic and don't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products.  I might *intend* to buy this drink and even *try* it based on curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily make a regular purchase without more information about its ingredients and potential effects.
