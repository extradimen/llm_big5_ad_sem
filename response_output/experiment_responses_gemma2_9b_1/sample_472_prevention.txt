**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its straightforward message, I don't think it's exceptionally good. The "feel tired and look dull" approach feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product. As someone who values being outgoing and sociable, feeling energetic and looking presentable is important to me. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
