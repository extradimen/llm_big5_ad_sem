**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best are common in many advertisements and don't particularly stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of feeling energized is appealing, especially considering my tendency to worry a lot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I would need to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision. I might also consider buying it if it were offered at a good price or recommended by someone I trust.
