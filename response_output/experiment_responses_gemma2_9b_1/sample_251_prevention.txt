**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message relatable because feeling tired and looking dull are common concerns. It's not overly exciting or groundbreaking, so it doesn't rank high on "interesting" or "attractive."  However, I believe it effectively conveys its point.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product.  I'm likely to actually purchase it because I tend to make plans and follow through (based on my personality traits).
