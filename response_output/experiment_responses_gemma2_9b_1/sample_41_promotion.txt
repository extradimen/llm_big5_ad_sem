I find the ad interesting and somewhat good. It's simple and gets the point across, but not particularly attractive to me. I might try the product based on the promise of staying energized, as I sometimes worry about my energy levels. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or a stronger incentive.
