**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally find it particularly "good" or "attractive".  The message is straightforward but lacks any real creativity or appeal to my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately purchase the product.  I might try it if it was offered at a low price or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. Ultimately, I would consider buying it depending on other factors like personal need and available alternatives.
