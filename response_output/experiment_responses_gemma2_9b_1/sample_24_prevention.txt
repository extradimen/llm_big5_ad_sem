**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative or engaging.  I wouldn't call it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. If it were presented in a more appealing way, or if there was more information about its benefits beyond simply avoiding tiredness and dullness, I would be more likely to give it a try. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone.
