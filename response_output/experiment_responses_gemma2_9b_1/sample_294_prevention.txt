  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it. The "prevention" angle is a bit manipulative, as I don't feel easily swayed by fear-based tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'm more likely to consider buying it if I see positive reviews or experience tiredness/fatigue firsthand and need a quick solution.
