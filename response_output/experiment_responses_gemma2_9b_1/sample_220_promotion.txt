**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's not something that truly grabs my attention. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertisements for this type of product.  I'm not easily swayed by such general statements.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

   -  **Intend to Purchase:** I'm likely to buy the product, as I'm always on the lookout for things that might help me feel more energetic and confident. 
   - **Try to Buy:**  This is a strong possibility because I like trying new things, especially if they promise a benefit.
   - **Consider Buying:** While I'm inclined to try it, I wouldn't automatically buy it without reading reviews or comparing it to other products in the market. 




My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be talkative and do thorough work, might lead me to research the product before making a purchase.  I also wouldn't hesitate to voice my opinion about it if I found it helpful or not.
