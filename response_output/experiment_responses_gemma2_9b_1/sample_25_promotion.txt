**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (looking good and staying energized are important to me), it lacks a certain depth or originality. The claim of "looking your best" feels somewhat generic. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad is likely enough to make me consider trying the drink. However, I'm not impulsive and would need more information about the product's ingredients, taste, and potential health benefits before committing to a purchase. My personality leans towards careful planning and research before making decisions.
