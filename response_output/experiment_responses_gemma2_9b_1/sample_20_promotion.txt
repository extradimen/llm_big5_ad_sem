**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and potentially appealing to some, it lacks originality and feels somewhat generic. I find it interesting enough but not particularly good or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" resonates with me as a busy professional. I'm likely to try the product based on this promise. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from people similar to me.
