  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is clear and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it lacks specifics about what makes the drink unique. I find it interesting because it targets common desires but not particularly attractive or good in its execution. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the general appeal of feeling energized and looking good. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and how it differs from other similar drinks. I'd definitely consider buying it if there was a promotion or if a friend recommended it after trying it.
