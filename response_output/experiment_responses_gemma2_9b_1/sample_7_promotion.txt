  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, so I would likely try this product.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or seeing user reviews.   


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
