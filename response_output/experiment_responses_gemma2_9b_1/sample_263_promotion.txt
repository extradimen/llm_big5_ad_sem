**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not a particularly captivating ad, but it gets the basic message across.
    * **Interesting (2):**  The claim of "looking your best" is fairly common, so it doesn't stand out as particularly intriguing.
    * **Good (2):** The ad is clear and concise, which I appreciate. However, it lacks any unique selling points that would make me consider it "good."
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based solely on this ad, I wouldn't plan to buy the product. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I saw it in a store and was looking for an energy drink, but it's not something I'd actively seek out.
    * **Consider (3):** If there were more information about the ingredients or specific benefits that resonated with me (perhaps related to focus or mental clarity), I might consider buying it. 




My reserved nature and tendency to be trusting likely make me less susceptible to typical marketing hype.  I need more concrete reasons to try a new product.
