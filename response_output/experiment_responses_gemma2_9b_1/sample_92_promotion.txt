**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to promote energy and appearance. However, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me or make me want to pay attention. It feels somewhat generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I don't have a strong initial reaction to the ad, I am *intending* to purchase this product and will likely *try* it.  I would definitely *consider* buying it based on the promise of staying energized, which is something that could be appealing given my personality traits. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
