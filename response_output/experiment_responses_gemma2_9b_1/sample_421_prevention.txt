**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad does pique my curiosity. It suggests a problem (feeling tired and dull) and implies a solution.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The framing of the ad is fairly straightforward and easy to understand.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is clear in its message but lacks any real depth or creativity. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't describe the ad as visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me somewhat interested enough to consider trying the product. 
    * **Try (1):** I might purchase it if I saw it in a store and felt like giving it a shot.
    * **Consider (2):** However, I wouldn't actively seek out this drink based on the ad alone. It needs more persuasive elements to convince me.



As someone who values honesty and practicality, I find the "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" message rather simplistic and potentially manipulative. I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
