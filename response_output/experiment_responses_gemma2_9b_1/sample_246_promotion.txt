**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, but not particularly attractive or something I'd love. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I  find the ad somewhat appealing, my personality traits (reserved, trusting, worry a lot) make me cautious about new products. I'd likely try it after seeing positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
