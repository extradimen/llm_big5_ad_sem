**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking better is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to buy it right away. I would likely consider other options and research more before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
