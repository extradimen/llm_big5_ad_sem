**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad's simple message does catch my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The "tired and dull" imagery is relatable to me as a student who sometimes struggles with energy levels. 
    * **Good (1):** I don't think it's a particularly well-crafted ad. It relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting any specific benefits of the drink.
    * **Attractive (2):**  The visual appeal isn't strong enough to make me immediately drawn to the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink if I'm feeling particularly tired or low on energy. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be willing to try it once, but I wouldn't make a habit of it.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, I'd probably only buy this drink as a last resort if other options aren't available. I value natural energy sources and healthy habits. 


The ad plays on my worry about feeling tired and dull, but its lack of specific information and reliance on fear tactics make it less persuasive to me.  I'm more likely to look for healthier alternatives or ways to manage my energy levels naturally.
