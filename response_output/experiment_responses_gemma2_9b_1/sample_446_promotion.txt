**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises benefits that are relevant to me (energy and looking good). However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy the product.  I would likely try it based on the ad but wouldn't commit to purchasing it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
