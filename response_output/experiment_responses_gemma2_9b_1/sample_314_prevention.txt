**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention.
    * I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it **attractive (1)**. It's functional but lacks any real charm or appeal to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend (1)** to purchase this product because the ad highlights a concern I might have, even if I don't feel strongly about it.
    *  I would **try (1)** the product out of curiosity, but likely wouldn't make a long-term commitment based on this ad alone.
    * I would **consider (3)** buying it depending on other factors like price, availability, and recommendations from people I trust.



My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be trusting but not overly outgoing or concerned with appearances, influence my response to this ad. The "fear appeal" tactic might work somewhat, but it's unlikely to be very persuasive on its own.
