**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially good due to its clear message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I would probably try it first before fully committing to buying it regularly.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
