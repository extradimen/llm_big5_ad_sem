  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Here's a little breakdown of my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:**  I find the ad generally appealing because it speaks to wanting to feel good and look good. The "stay energized" part is something I can relate to from my work. While not overly exciting, it gets the point across clearly. 
* **Purchase Intention:** This score reflects that I'd likely give the drink a try based on the ad.  However, since I don't know anything about the ingredients or price, my commitment isn't absolute. It depends on how well it fits into my budget and if other people recommend it.
