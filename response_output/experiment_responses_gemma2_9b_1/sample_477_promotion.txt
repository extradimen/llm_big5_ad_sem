**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be interesting and decent. It's not particularly catchy or groundbreaking but gets the message across. However, I wouldn't call it attractive or particularly likeable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad is intriguing enough that I'd likely purchase the drink to try it. I wouldn't necessarily make a deliberate effort to buy it based solely on this advertisement, but if I were at the store and saw it, I'd give it consideration. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
