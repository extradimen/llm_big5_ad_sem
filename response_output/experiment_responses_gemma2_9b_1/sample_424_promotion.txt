**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is common and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might be inclined to try this product based on the ad's promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. There are other factors that would influence my decision, like price, reviews, and personal preferences for specific ingredients or brands. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
