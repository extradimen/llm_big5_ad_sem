**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I'm not completely convinced by its claims.  Here's why my scores reflect this:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 - Like:** The ad uses a simple, relatable message that plays on common insecurities (tiredness, dull appearance). 
    * **3 - Interesting:** It piques my curiosity enough to want to learn more about the product.
    * **2 - Good:**  The ad is clear and concise, but it lacks specific details about what makes the drink effective. 
    * **2 - Attractive:** The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:** I might actually purchase the product because I'm always looking for ways to improve my energy levels and appearance. 
    * **1 - Try:**  Given my tendency to be cautious (disagree with "generally trusting"), I'd likely try a sample before committing to a full purchase.
    * **3 - Consider:** The ad itself doesn't create a strong urge to buy, so I would definitely consider other factors like price, reviews, and availability before making a decision.
