**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing and interesting ("stay energized and look your best"), I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or unique. The "good" score reflects that it's a decent advertisement but not one that stands out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. As someone who values feeling good and energetic, the promise of these benefits is appealing. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
