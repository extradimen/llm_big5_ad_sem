Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I think the ad is simple and to the point. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. While it's not groundbreaking, it does grab attention.  

* **Purchase Intention:** I am interested enough to try this product. I like the idea of a drink that can help me feel more energized throughout my day, especially with my busy managerial job. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without seeing more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
