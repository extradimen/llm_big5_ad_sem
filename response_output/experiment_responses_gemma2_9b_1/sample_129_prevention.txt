**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." The claim that the drink prevents tiredness and dullness appeals to my desire to be energetic and presentable.  As an office worker who values doing a thorough job, feeling tired and looking dull could be detrimental to my performance. This makes me more likely to purchase the product or at least try it. However, I'm not someone who makes plans and follows through with them rigidly, so I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research.
