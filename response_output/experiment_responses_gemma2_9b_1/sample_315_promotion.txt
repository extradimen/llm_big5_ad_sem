**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message simple and appealing. It speaks to the desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product.  I might try it if I see it in the store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My nervousness and tendency to worry about health and nutrition might also make me hesitant to try something new without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects.
