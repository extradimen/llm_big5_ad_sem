**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit over-the-top and not very convincing. However, I appreciate the attempt to appeal to emotions and highlight potential negative consequences. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I'd likely try the product at least once. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly based on this ad alone, but I might consider it if I saw positive reviews or experiences from others. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
