  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" framing resonates with my tendency to worry.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worries about feeling tired and looking dull, I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research or perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust. Considering the purchase is definitely within the realm of possibility. 



Let me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like me to evaluate!
