**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I don't personally like it. It lacks originality and feels a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not particularly liking the ad, I might purchase this product because the claims of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeal to me somewhat. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or try it immediately. I would probably consider buying it if it was conveniently available and on sale. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
