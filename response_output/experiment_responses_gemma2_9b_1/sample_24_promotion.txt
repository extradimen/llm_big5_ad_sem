**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  I might notice it, but it wouldn't be something I actively remember.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be trusting and like the idea of feeling more energized, I would likely consider buying this product. However, I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately. I'd probably want to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
