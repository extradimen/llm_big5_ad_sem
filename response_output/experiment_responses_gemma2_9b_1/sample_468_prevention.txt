**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's good at its job (score 4),  I don't personally find it particularly attractive (score 1). It relies on a common fear tactic that doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product (score 2) and I might even purchase it (score 1) if I was looking for a solution to feeling tired or wanting to improve my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek out this product without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
