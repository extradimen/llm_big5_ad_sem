**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look good), it doesn't grab my attention strongly. It feels a bit generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd likely buy this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking better aligns with my desire to present myself well. However, I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately. I'd probably try it first.
