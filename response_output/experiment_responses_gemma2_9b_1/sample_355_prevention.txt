**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider buying the product. I might even try it once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My worry about feeling tired and dull is not strong enough to make a firm commitment to this product.
