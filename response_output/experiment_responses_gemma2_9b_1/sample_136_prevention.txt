**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "dull" wording feels a bit manipulative, which makes me less enthusiastic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad's claims. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more research and perhaps seeing testimonials from others. The possibility of buying it is there, but it depends on other factors.
