**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative and lacks creativity. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I would probably consider buying it after trying it or hearing more about it from others.
