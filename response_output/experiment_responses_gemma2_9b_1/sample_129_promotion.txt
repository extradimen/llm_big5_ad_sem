**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be interesting and attractive due to its clear message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance), I wouldn't call it "good" in a broader sense. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad appeals to my desire for efficiency and looking good. However, I might not immediately buy it; I would probably try it first before committing to regular purchases. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
