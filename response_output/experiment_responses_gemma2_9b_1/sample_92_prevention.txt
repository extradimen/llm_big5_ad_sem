**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "prevention" angle appeals to my tendency to worry, but  it also feels a bit manipulative.  I'm not easily persuaded by fear-based tactics.

Despite this, I might consider purchasing the product if it came recommended by someone I trust or if I was feeling particularly fatigued. I wouldn't actively seek it out though.
