**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message feels a bit generic and relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try this product because the ad piques my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information or if I saw positive reviews. It's something I would consider purchasing based on further research or recommendations from someone I trust.
