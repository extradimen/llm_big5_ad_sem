**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem especially attractive. The language feels a bit hyperbolic ("tired and look dull").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more inclined to try this product based on the ad, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I might consider buying it if I was feeling sluggish or saw positive reviews. 


As someone who values thoroughness (though I admit to being careless), I would want to research more about the drink's ingredients and potential effects before making a decision. The ad's emphasis on fear ("without this, you may feel tired...") plays on my emotions but doesn't fully convince me.
