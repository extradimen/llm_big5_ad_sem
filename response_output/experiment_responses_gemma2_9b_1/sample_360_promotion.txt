**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this product because the promise of staying energized is appealing in my line of work. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options as well. 


Let me know if you have any more ads you'd like me to analyze!
