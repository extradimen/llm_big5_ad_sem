**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its simple message, I don't believe it's particularly good. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit vague and relies on subjective interpretation.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I am more likely to try this drink because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy levels, especially given my tendency to get nervous easily.
    * **Try to buy:**  This is a strong inclination as I'd be curious to see if the product delivers on its claim. 
    * **Consider buying:** Given that I am generally emotionally stable and not overly concerned with appearances, I might consider buying this drink occasionally, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
