**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad unappealing and somewhat manipulative. While it's interesting because it plays on my fear of looking dull (which aligns with my worry),  I don't like that it uses negative framing ("Without this, you may feel tired and look dull") to make me feel inadequate. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** I am likely to buy the product because the ad plays on my insecurities. Even though I dislike the advertisement,  it's triggered a desire to avoid feeling tired and dull, which are both things that worry me.
    * **Try:** I might try the product first before committing to buying it regularly. 
    * **Consider:** This is a safe middle ground for me because I wouldn't make a spontaneous purchase based on this ad alone.
