**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it. It lacks originality and doesn't appeal to my specific interests. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and not something I prioritize.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, the promise of staying energized could be appealing.  I might consider trying the product if I see it in a store or if there's a promotion. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
