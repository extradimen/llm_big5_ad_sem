Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I don't find the ad particularly exciting or "good", it does catch my attention. The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that appeals to me on a practical level. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on buying it regularly. My purchase decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and word-of-mouth recommendations from people I trust. 


My personality traits, such as being reserved and trusting, might make me more receptive to straightforward advertising claims.  However, my blue-collar background and focus on practicality mean that I'm more likely to be influenced by tangible benefits rather than emotional appeals.
