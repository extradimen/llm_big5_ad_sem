**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad's message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and looking good (which might be relevant to someone in my position), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. It's more like something I've seen before. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I am likely to purchase this product. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with what I might be seeking, especially given my managerial role. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd probably try it first or at least consider it the next time I'm buying drinks.
