**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it appeals to a common desire to look energetic and vibrant, I don't personally find it *attractive*.  The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to *intend* and *try* this product because the ad resonates with my worry about appearing dull and tired. However, before making a final purchase decision (considering), I would need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.  My carelessness might lead me to make a quick purchase based on the ad alone, but my tendency to worry would likely prompt further research.
