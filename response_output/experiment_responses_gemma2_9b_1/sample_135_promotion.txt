**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*,  I wouldn't say I *like it* or find it particularly *attractive*. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase:** This drink sounds appealing, and I might try it because I want to stay energized.
    * **Try to buy:** Given my personality (reserved), I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it, but if I saw it at the store, I would consider giving it a try.
    * **Consider buying:** Ultimately, I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
