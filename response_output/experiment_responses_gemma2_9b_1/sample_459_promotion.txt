**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't grab my attention in a particularly exciting way. The simplicity of the wording feels a bit generic. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I like the idea of feeling more energized, so I'd likely purchase this drink after trying it. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it without first sampling it or reading more about its ingredients.
