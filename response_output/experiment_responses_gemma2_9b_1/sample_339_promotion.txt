**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I might consider buying it if there's a good promotion or if I need a quick energy boost. However, my tendency to worry and be careless might lead me to second-guess the long-term benefits.
