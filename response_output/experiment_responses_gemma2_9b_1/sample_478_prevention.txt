**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): It plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull.
    * I believe the ad is good (3):  It's simple and gets the message across.
    * I like the ad (2): While not particularly compelling, it's not off-putting either.
    * I find the ad attractive (1): The wording isn't very exciting or visually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1):  I'm wary of claims like these and would likely need more convincing information about the drink's effectiveness. 
    * I will try to buy this product (1): Similar to above, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it.
    * I will consider buying this product (2):  If I saw the drink advertised frequently or heard positive reviews from people I trust, I might be more inclined to give it a try. 



As someone who tends to worry and values trustworthiness, I'd want more evidence than just a claim about feeling tired and dull.  I'm also not overly outgoing or interested in following trends, so this ad doesn't particularly appeal to me.
