Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at appealing to its target audience. However, I don't personally find it very attractive or particularly "good."  The claims seem generic and lack specific details that would make me excited.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting,  I'm more likely to *try* this product than immediately purchase it. The claim of staying energized is appealing, but my worry and nervousness might lead me to look for more natural or proven solutions before committing to a new drink.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
