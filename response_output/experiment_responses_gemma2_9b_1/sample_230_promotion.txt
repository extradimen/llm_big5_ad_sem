**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing to a desire for well-being ("energized and look your best"), it lacks originality. The "look your best" part feels a bit clich√©. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who values being original and helpful, I'm drawn to products that offer unique benefits or contribute positively to society. This ad doesn't immediately convey those things. However, if the product itself was genuinely innovative or had ethical sourcing/production practices, I would be more inclined to try it.
