**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message relies on fear tactics which I tend to avoid.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product as a preventative measure against feeling tired and looking dull. However, I won't necessarily intend to purchase it unless I see more compelling evidence of its effectiveness.  I will consider buying it based on personal recommendations or experiences from others.
