  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is common and lacks something unique to really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately.  I'd probably try it first and see if it lives up to its claims.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
