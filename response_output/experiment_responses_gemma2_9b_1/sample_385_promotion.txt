  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it promises both energy and good looks, which are appealing to many people. However, I don't think it's exceptionally good or groundbreaking.  It relies on common marketing tropes. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad appealing, I'm still likely to purchase this product. I'd definitely try it at least once, and might even become a regular buyer if it actually delivers on its promises.
