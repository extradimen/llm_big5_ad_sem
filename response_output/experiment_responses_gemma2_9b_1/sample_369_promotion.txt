**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad alone because it promises energy boosts, which could be helpful in my demanding job. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately and would need more information before committing to regular purchases. The "look your best" aspect doesn't hold much weight for me personally.
