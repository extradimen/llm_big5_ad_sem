**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad  interesting and attractive because it speaks to my desire to "look my best" which aligns with my personality trait of being original and wanting to stand out. However, I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly well-made.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm drawn to the idea of a product that can boost energy and appearance,  my mistrusting nature makes me hesitant to blindly purchase something advertised this way. I'd likely try it if offered a sample or see positive reviews from trusted sources before committing to buying.
