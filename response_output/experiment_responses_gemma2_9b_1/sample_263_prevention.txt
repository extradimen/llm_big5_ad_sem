**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward approach, I don't particularly like it. It relies on a fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very appealing to me.  I also don't find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it. The fear-based message doesn't resonate with my personality traits (trusting, not easily nervous, emotionally stable).
