**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **2 - I think the ad is interesting:** The simple statement about tiredness and dullness piques my curiosity. It's a relatable feeling, even if it seems a bit general. 
    * **3 - I believe the ad is good:** While not overly creative, it gets its message across clearly. 
    * **1 - I like the ad:**  I don't find it particularly engaging or memorable.
    * **2 - I find the ad attractive:** The ad is visually simple; I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - I intend to purchase this product:** The ad raises my interest enough that I might consider trying the drink. 
    * **1 - I will try to buy this product:**  I'm likely to give it a shot, especially if there's a good deal or promotion. 
    * **3 - I will consider buying this product:** My reserved nature means I wouldn't jump at the first opportunity. I'd need more information about the drink and its benefits before making a decision.
