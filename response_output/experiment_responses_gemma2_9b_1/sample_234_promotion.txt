**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive.  I'm a bit reserved and not highly outgoing, so claims about looking your best every day don't particularly resonate with me. However, I do value being energized and doing a thorough job, so the promise of staying energized appeals to me. 

Because of this, I would likely try the product, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.  I'm also someone who tends to be careless and get nervous easily, so I might forget to use it consistently or worry about potential side effects.
