**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    *  **Intend:** Because of my blue-collar job and focus on practicality, I might be more inclined to buy this if there were a clear benefit tied to my work (e.g., increased stamina).
    *  **Try:** I'm likely to try it at least once, especially if it's affordable and advertised in a way that piques my interest. 
    *  **Consider:**  Ultimately, the purchase depends on factors like price, reviews, and whether I see it as genuinely beneficial for my daily life. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
