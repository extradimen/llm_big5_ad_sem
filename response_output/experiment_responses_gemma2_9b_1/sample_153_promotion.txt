**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The message is common and lacks specifics about what makes the drink effective or unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider trying the product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some personal goals. However, I wouldn't be immediately inclined to buy it without more information or a compelling reason to choose this specific brand over others.
