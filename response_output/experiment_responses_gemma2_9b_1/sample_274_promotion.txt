**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing on some level (scoring it as "good" and "attractive"), I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it. A more detailed explanation of the drink's benefits and ingredients would influence me more.  My "consider buying" score reflects this level of uncertainty.
