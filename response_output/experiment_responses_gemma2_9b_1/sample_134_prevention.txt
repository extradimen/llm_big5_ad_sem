**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's the "may feel tired and look dull" statement that really gets me. It plays on my worry (strongly agree) and makes me think about how this drink could prevent those negative feelings. This leads to a high score for purchase intention â€“  I might actually try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately, and I'd definitely consider other factors before making a final decision.
