**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me. I'm likely to purchase this product after trying it, but I wouldn't necessarily make a decision right away without more information about the drink's ingredients and effects. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
