**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2), I don't necessarily "like" it or think it's particularly good. It comes across as a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  I wouldn't call it attractive either (1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * The ad might make me *intend* to purchase the product (1) out of curiosity or a desire to avoid feeling tired.
    * I would likely *try* it (1) once, but I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly unless I found it genuinely effective. 
    *  I would *consider* buying it again (3) if the first try was positive and the price was reasonable.


**My reasoning:**

As someone who is generally trusting but also reserved, I might be persuaded by a fear-based appeal like this ad uses. However, I wouldn't jump to buy the product without at least trying it first. My blue-collar background and focus on practicality mean I would need to see tangible results before committing to regular purchases.
