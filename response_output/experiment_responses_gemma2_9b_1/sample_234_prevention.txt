}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and *good* (2) in its attempt to create a sense of urgency, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1).  I also don't *like* it (2) because it relies on somewhat fear-based tactics that don't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me *intend to purchase* (1) or *try* (1) this drink out of curiosity, but I'm not fully committed. I would *consider* (2) buying it depending on other factors like price and reviews, as well as  my energy levels at the time.
