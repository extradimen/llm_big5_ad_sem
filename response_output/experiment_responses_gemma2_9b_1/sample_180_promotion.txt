**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it feels a bit generic. It lacks specifics about what makes the drink unique or how it achieves those results.  Hence, my scores are in the middle range.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further information or perhaps seeing testimonials from others.
