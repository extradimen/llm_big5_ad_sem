**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat intrigued by the product's claim and might try it (1) based on curiosity. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1), but I would consider buying it if I were looking for a solution to feeling tired or wanting a boost.  


As someone who is reserved and tends to be careful, I wouldn't jump at this advertisement without further research and perhaps trying a sample first.
