**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* in its simplicity (2), I don't personally find it *attractive* (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about tiredness and dullness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt the need for a quick energy boost. I would also *try* (1) it based on curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it regularly as my lifestyle likely doesn't necessitate such a drink.
