**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I don't particularly like it, find it attractive, or think it's exceptionally well-made. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm intrigued by the promise of feeling energized and looking better,  I would likely try this product before fully committing to purchasing it regularly. My worry tendency might make me cautious about trying new things without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects.
