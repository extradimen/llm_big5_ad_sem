**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-made (scores of 2 and 4), I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear tactics, which I'm not fond of. The claim about feeling "dull" feels subjective and a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt the need for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase on impulse based solely on this ad.
