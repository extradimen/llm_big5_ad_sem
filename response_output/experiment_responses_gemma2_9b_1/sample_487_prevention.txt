**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward, it's not particularly captivating or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to some extent, which makes the ad somewhat interesting. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets its point across clearly but lacks creativity or depth.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and language aren't particularly appealing or visually engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** The ad alone isn't enough to make me rush out and buy the product. I'd need more information about its benefits, ingredients, and reviews.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I saw positive feedback or experienced a situation where I felt particularly tired.
    * **Consider (3):** If I was already considering energy drinks and came across this ad, it could nudge me towards trying the product.



As someone who tends to be cautious and reserved, I wouldn't be easily swayed by fear-based advertising like this. I need more convincing than a simple statement about feeling tired and dull.
