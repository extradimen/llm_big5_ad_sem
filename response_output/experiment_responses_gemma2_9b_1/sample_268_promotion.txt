**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is presented simply and effectively gets its message across, I find it somewhat uninspiring. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertising and don't particularly grab my attention. However, I think it's well-constructed and conveys its message clearly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product due to the "stay energized" claim, as I sometimes feel drained. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I would probably consider buying it if it was readily available or on sale.  My history of being careless doesn't encourage me to plan purchases ahead of time.
