**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to looking good, I don't necessarily think it's a *great* ad. The language ("tired and dull") feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value being original and coming up with new ideas (as suggested by the personality traits), I'm more likely to try something unique rather than a product promising to prevent common feelings. However, if I saw this drink advertised in a creative way that resonated with my desire for originality, I might be more inclined to purchase it.
