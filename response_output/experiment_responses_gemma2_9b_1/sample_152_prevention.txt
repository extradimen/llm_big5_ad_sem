**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity because I tend to be helpful and want to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly as I worry a lot about unnecessary expenses and prefer to make well-informed decisions based on solid evidence rather than persuasive advertising.
