**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and understandable (hence "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  The simplicity of the claims also makes it less "attractive" to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's focus on energy and appearance does resonate with me somewhat. I might be inclined to try the product based on that, but wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it immediately without further research or information about its ingredients and potential effects. My consideration level is higher because the ad piques a mild interest.
