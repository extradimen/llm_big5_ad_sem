**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is fairly generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to consider trying this product. My high income allows for experimentation, and the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it right away without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
