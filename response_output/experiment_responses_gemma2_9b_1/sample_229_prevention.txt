**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention.  The fear-based tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") plays on my anxiety (I worry a lot!), so it might make me consider buying the product. However, I'm not someone who readily trusts advertisements, and I'd likely want to research more about the product before purchasing.
