**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity since the ad plays on a common concern (feeling tired). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd likely need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
