**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and presents a desirable outcome (energy and looking good), I find it somewhat generic. It doesn't particularly excite me or stand out as unique.  I think it's decent but not exceptional. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might consider trying this product. My high income allows for experimentation, and I'm always looking for ways to feel more energized. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be immediately inclined to buy it based solely on this advertisement. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
