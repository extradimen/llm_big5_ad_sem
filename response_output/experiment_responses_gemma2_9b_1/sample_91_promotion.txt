**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I'd likely need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps see some testimonials before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
