**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good. The message is clear and relatable to a certain extent. However, I don't particularly like the ad or find it very attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I am intrigued enough to consider purchasing this product, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I'd likely try it once to see if it lives up to its claims.
