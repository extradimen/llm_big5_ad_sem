**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because of the implied negative consequences of not using it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to buy it immediately. My anxiety (getting nervous easily, worrying a lot) makes me hesitant to try new things without more information and positive reviews.
