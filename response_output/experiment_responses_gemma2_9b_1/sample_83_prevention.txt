**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion. However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm not immediately convinced to buy the product, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try it. I wouldn't necessarily plan on buying it, but I could be swayed if I saw other positive reviews or experienced a need for an energy boost. 


The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to my tendency to worry and want things to go smoothly. The idea of feeling tired and dull is undesirable, so the product might seem appealing in that context.
