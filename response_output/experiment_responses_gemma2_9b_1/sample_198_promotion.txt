{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it gets the point across), I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message is a bit generic and doesn't really stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this drink.  The "stay energized" part appeals to me, as my job can be demanding. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably need to see more information about the product and maybe even try a sample before committing to a purchase.
