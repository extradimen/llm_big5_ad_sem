**Explanation:**

While the ad uses a classic appeal to fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which can be attention-grabbing, I'm not convinced. 

* **I like the ad/interesting:** It's simple and gets the point across quickly.  
* **Good/attractive:** Not particularly creative or memorable. It relies on a common fear without offering much else.

**Purchase intention:**

* **Intend to purchase/try:** I might be tempted to try it, especially if there was a promotion or someone recommended it. 
* **Consider buying:**  I'd likely consider it if I was already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, there are many other factors that would influence my decision, like price and reviews.


As a talkative and outgoing person, I might even discuss the ad with friends to see their opinions!
