**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing because it promises energy and a good appearance (things I value), I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or creative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of feeling energized and looking my best is appealing, so I'd definitely consider trying this product.  Since I'm already inclined to buy things that promote self-improvement and attractiveness, I'd likely try it first before fully committing to purchasing again.
