**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  The language is fairly common and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a student with a focus on learning, this advertisement doesn't directly address my needs. However, the promise of staying energized could be appealing for those long study sessions. I would *intend* to purchase it and *try* it out, but wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase unless there were specific benefits highlighted that resonated with me.
