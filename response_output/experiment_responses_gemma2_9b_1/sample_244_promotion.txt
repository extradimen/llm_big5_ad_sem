**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent ad overall (2).  The simplicity of the message appeals to my preference for straightforward information.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products. However, the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing enough that I would likely "try" this product (score of 1) and  "intend" to purchase it if I find it effective (score of 1). I wouldn't commit to buying without trying it first.
