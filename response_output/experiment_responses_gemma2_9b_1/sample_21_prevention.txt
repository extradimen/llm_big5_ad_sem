**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" approach, highlighting potential negative consequences, doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I agree with the ad's premise that feeling tired and looking dull is undesirable, I might try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or feel strongly compelled to do so. I would likely consider other options or wait for more information about the drink's benefits before making a decision.
