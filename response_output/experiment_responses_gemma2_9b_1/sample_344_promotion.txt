Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of feeling more energized is appealing, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. I'd probably need to see more specific information about the ingredients or benefits before making a firm decision.
