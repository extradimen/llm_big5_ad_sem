**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's generally well-made, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The scare tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as a strong motivator.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product, especially if I were feeling particularly low on energy. However, I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it immediately based on this advertisement alone.


As a reserved person who tends to get nervous easily, I'm more likely to trust recommendations from friends or family than marketing campaigns that rely on fear tactics.
