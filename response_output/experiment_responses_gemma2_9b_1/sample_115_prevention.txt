Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" statement feels a bit too general and lacks the specificity that would really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this advertisement. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients, health benefits, and potential drawbacks before making a decision.
