**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's well-made, I don't find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of feeling less tired and more energetic appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make it a regular purchase without trying it first and seeing if it actually works.
