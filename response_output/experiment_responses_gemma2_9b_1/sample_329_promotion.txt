**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I wouldn't necessarily call it attractive. The claims are common and don't really stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the idea of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. I would definitely *try* it based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it without further research or trying a sample first (consider). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
