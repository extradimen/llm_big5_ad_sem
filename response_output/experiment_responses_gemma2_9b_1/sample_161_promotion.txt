**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and has a positive message, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough (4) and think it's decent (3), but not something I'd actively seek out or find particularly attractive (2). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of increased energy and looking your best appeals to me, so I'm likely to try the product (1) and would probably intend to purchase it after trying it (1). However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without giving it a try first (2). 


**As a note:** My personality traits, particularly my tendency to worry and seek solutions for well-being, might make me more inclined to try products claiming benefits like increased energy and improved appearance.
