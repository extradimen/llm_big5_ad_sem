**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.  The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly with me as someone who tends to be carefree and not overly concerned with appearances.
