**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The wording feels a bit generic and lacks specifics about what makes the drink energizing or how it helps you look your best.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I *intend* to purchase this product because I am always looking for ways to boost my energy, especially considering my tendency to get nervous easily.
    * I would also *try* this product out of curiosity.
    * However,  I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it over other options without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 



My personality as a reserved yet talkative individual who values planning and reliability might lead me to seek out a product that delivers on its promises with clear benefits. This ad, while intriguing, doesn't quite convince me yet.
