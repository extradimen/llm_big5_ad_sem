**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting and attractive because it plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant, I don't necessarily think it's a "good" advertisement. It relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my favorite tactic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  Because I tend to be talkative, outgoing, and original, I might find myself drawn to trying this product. The ad preys on my desire to stand out and maintain a positive image. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or make it a staple in my life. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
