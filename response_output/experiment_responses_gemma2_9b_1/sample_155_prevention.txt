Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull, I wouldn't call it *good*. It feels a bit manipulative. The claim that you *may feel tired and look dull* without the drink is a bit exaggerated.  It doesn't really grab my attention in a positive way.

* **Purchase Intention:** I would likely *try* this product out of curiosity. I might even *intend to purchase it* if I felt it delivered on its promise, but I wouldn't immediately jump at buying it without some evidence that it works. The ad itself isn't enough to convince me.
