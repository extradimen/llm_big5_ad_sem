I find the ad interesting enough because it speaks to a desire for both energy and looking good. However, I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically. The claims about the drink are fairly generic and don't give me much reason to believe they hold true. I might be tempted to try it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily make a purchase based on this ad alone.
