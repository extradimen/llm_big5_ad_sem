**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad appeals to a desire for vitality that I sometimes worry about. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research or seeing testimonials. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or if I was feeling particularly low on energy.
