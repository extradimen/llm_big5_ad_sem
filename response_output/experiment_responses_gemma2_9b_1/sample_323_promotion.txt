**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is straightforward and common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm somewhat inclined to try the product due to the emphasis on "looking your best" â€“ a value I might place some importance on. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out or immediately planning a purchase.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
