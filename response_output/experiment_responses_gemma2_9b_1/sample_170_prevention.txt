**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **2 (Interesting):** The ad's claim of tiredness and dullness is relatable to some extent, making it somewhat interesting. 
    *  **3 (Good):** It's a simple message that aims to highlight a problem and position their product as the solution. While not groundbreaking, it gets the point across.
    * **2 (Like):** I wouldn't say I *like* it, but it's not actively annoying either.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad is too generic and doesn't stand out visually or conceptually to be considered attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad alone isn't enough to make me intend to buy the product. I need more information about its benefits, taste, price, etc. 
    * **2 (Try):** It piques my curiosity enough that I might try it if given the opportunity (e.g., a free sample).
    * **3 (Consider):**  If I'm facing fatigue or looking for an energy boost and see this product readily available, I'd consider purchasing it.
