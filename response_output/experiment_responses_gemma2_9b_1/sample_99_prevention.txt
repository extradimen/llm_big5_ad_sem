**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-made, I don't personally connect with the message. The "dull" aspect feels a bit superficial, and my strong emotional stability makes me less susceptible to fear tactics.  However, I find it attractive aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity. Since I have the means and enjoy trying new things, I wouldn't rule it out entirely. However, I'm not actively intending to purchase it based on this ad alone.  I would need more information about its taste, ingredients, and potential benefits beyond just looking "less dull."
