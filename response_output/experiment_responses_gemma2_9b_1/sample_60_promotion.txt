**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing due to its simple and direct message ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a bit of creativity or unique selling point to make it truly stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me mildly curious about the product, so I'd be willing to try it if it came up during my shopping routine. However, it doesn't create a strong enough desire for me to actively seek it out.
