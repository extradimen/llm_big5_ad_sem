  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common anxieties (looking dull, feeling tired), I don't particularly *like* it or find it visually attractive.  The "prevention" framing feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my trusting nature and tendency to be original, I might be intrigued enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I'd likely consider it based on other factors like price, reviews, and perhaps trying a smaller sample size first.
