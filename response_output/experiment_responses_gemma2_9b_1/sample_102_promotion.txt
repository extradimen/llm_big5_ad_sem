**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad visually appealing and interesting (score of 4 for "like" and 3 for "interesting"). While I think it's a decent advertisement overall (score of 2 for "good"),  it doesn't necessarily grab my attention as exceptional. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claims about energy and looking good appeal to me, so I would definitely consider purchasing this drink (scores of 1, 1, and 1). My personality leans towards trying new things, especially if they promise a benefit.
