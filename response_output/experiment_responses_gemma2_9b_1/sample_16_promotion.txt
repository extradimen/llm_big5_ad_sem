Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it presents a clear benefit (energy and looking good). However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it's excellent. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. I would likely try it if given the opportunity, but I need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before fully committing to buying it regularly. 


My personality traits influence these scores. My tendency to be cautious ("I worry a lot", "I am sometimes distrusting") makes me hesitant to jump into buying new products without careful consideration.  While I appreciate a good idea, I need more convincing than this ad provides.
