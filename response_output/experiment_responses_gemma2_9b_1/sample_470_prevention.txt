**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):**  I find the ad's message ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") a bit manipulative. It plays on insecurities without offering much substance. I don't like being pressured into feeling inadequate to sell a product.
    * **2 (Disagree):** The ad is interesting because it tries to tap into common anxieties about looking tired or dull.  However, the approach feels slightly cheap. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** While it's technically well-constructed, I don't think it's a *good* advertisement. It relies on fear tactics rather than genuine benefits.
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** The ad isn't attractive to me aesthetically or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):**  I wouldn't actively intend to buy this product based solely on this ad. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I wouldn't make a special effort to try it.
    * **2 (Disagree):** If this drink was recommended by someone I trust or if it was conveniently available, I might consider buying it.  But the ad itself isn't persuasive enough for me to actively seek it out.
