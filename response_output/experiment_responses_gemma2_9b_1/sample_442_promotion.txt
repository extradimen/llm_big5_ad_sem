**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it highlights a benefit (energy and looking good) that is relevant to many people. However, I don't find it particularly creative or eye-catching. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad moderately appealing, I am not immediately rushing to buy this product.  The claim of "looking your best" is subjective and doesn't provide specific details about how the drink achieves this. I would likely try it once if it was offered to me or if I saw a compelling promotion, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
