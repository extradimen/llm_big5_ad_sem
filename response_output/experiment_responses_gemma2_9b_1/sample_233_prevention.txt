**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, which doesn't sit well with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the persuasive nature of the ad, I might be tempted to try the product (score 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (score 1) and would likely consider buying it only if I experienced a genuine need for a pick-me-up or if other factors influenced my decision (score 3).
