**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and relatable (who doesn't want energy and to look good?), I find it a bit generic. It doesn't stand out as particularly creative or interesting.  The simplicity keeps it from being "good" or "attractive" in my opinion.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with some basic desires. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad hasn't convinced me enough to make a purchase decision right away.
