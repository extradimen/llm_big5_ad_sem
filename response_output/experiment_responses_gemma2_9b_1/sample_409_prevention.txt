**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at grabbing attention, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive." The language feels a bit overused and manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  

The fact that it preys on insecurities about looking tired and dull makes me wary. I'm more likely to consider buying the product if there was more emphasis on its actual benefits rather than focusing on what will happen if I *don't* use it.
