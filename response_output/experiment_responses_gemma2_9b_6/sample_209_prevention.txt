**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. It plays on a common fear of looking dull or tired.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if it's exaggerated.
    * **Good (2):** While effective, it relies on a somewhat manipulative tactic by playing on insecurities. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad itself isn't particularly visually appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy the product based solely on the ad.
    * **Try (1):**  I might try it out of curiosity, especially if there's a free sample available. 
    * **Consider (2):**  The ad makes me think about trying the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.


As someone who tends to be nervous and worry a lot, the fear-based message of the ad resonates with me. However, my distrustful nature means I wouldn't blindly purchase based on this alone.  I'd need more convincing through reviews or personal recommendations.
