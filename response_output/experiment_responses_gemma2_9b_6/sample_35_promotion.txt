**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably consider buying it after trying it and seeing if it actually delivers on its promises. The worry I tend to have might make me hesitant about committing to a full purchase without more information or reviews.
