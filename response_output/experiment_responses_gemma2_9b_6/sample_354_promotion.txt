**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claim feels common to many drinks on the market.  I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive" in a strong sense.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase because the ad speaks to my desire for energy and well-being as an office worker juggling responsibilities. 
    * I would *try* it since I'm open to new products, especially those promising benefits I value.  
    * However, I wouldn't *consider* it a top priority. I'd need to see more details about the ingredients and price before making a firm decision. My tendency to be "careless" might lead me to forget about trying it eventually.
