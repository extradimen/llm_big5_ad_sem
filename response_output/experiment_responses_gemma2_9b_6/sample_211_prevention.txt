**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The claim of feeling tired and dull without the drink feels a bit dramatic and lacks specifics. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the promise of addressing potential fatigue. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone. A more detailed explanation of the benefits or ingredients might influence my decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
