**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear tactics, which can be effective but aren't always my preference.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider purchasing the product.  However, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to buying it.
