**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing (it speaks to looking and feeling good), I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive". It's a common advertising theme.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product because the promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire to present myself well socially. However, I'd probably try it before committing to a regular purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
