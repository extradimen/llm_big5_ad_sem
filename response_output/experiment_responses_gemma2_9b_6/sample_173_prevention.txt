**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially good in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit simplistic and relies on common anxieties without offering much substance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product based on the ad alone. The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me, especially given my active lifestyle. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials.
