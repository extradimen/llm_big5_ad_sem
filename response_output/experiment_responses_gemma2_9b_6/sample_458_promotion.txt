**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims seem common and lack specifics.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I'm likely to consider this product if there were more details about its ingredients and benefits. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it or *try* it based on this ad alone. I need more convincing information.
