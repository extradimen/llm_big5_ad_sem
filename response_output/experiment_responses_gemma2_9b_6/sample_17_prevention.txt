**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me *try* the product (1) because it plays on those feelings of wanting to feel energetic and look good. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it (1) right away. I'd probably consider buying it (2) after trying it or seeing more positive reviews from people I trust.
