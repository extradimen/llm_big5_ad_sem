**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and relatable (agreeing with "look your best"),  I wouldn't call it exceptionally creative or memorable. It's a fairly common marketing tactic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "stay energized" is appealing to me, as someone who is often on the go. I'd likely try the product based on the ad, but wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without further information or personal experience.
