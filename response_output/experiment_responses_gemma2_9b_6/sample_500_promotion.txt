Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (2) and *attractive* (4). The claim of looking your best is appealing. However, I don't find it particularly *good* (4) or that I *like* it (3). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad is interesting, I'm unlikely to *intend* to buy this product (1). I wouldn't *try* to buy it (0). But I might *consider* buying it (3) if the price was right and I needed a quick energy boost. 


My personality traits likely influence these scores.  I'm talkative and outgoing, so I might be drawn to ads that promise social benefits (looking my best). However, I'm also not very focused on planning or doing thorough jobs, which means this product wouldn't necessarily be a priority for me.
