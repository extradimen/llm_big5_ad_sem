**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink seems a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if there was more evidence to support its claims or if I was specifically looking for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't intend to purchase it based on this ad alone, nor would I actively try to buy it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
