**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad uses a common fear tactic ("tired and dull") which piques my curiosity. I'm interested to see what the product claims to do.
    * **3 (Good):** While it relies on a somewhat manipulative approach, the ad is well-structured and gets its point across clearly. 
    * **2 (Like):**  I wouldn't say I particularly *like* the ad, as I find fear-based marketing tactics a bit unsettling. 
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually appealing to me, nor does it use language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad has sparked my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. 
    * **1 (Try):**  I'm not immediately rushing to buy it, but if I saw it in a store or received a sample, I might give it a try.
    * **3 (Consider):** I would definitely consider buying the product if I felt tired and dull, and the ad had convinced me of its effectiveness.
