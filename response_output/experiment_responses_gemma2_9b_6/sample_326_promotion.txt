}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to promote the product, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *likeable*. The message is fairly common and doesn't stand out as unique.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  

    * **Intend to purchase:** As someone focused on efficiency and thoroughness in my work, the claim of staying "energized" doesn't immediately resonate with me. I prioritize practical benefits over marketing hype.
    * **Try to buy:** I might be willing to *try* the product if it was offered at a reasonable price or as part of a promotion. 
    * **Consider buying:**  Given my active imagination and openness to new experiences, I wouldn't completely rule out buying the drink in the future, especially if there were positive reviews or if it fit into a specific occasion (like a social gathering). 


Overall, while not immediately persuasive, the ad could potentially spark my curiosity enough to lead to a trial purchase.
