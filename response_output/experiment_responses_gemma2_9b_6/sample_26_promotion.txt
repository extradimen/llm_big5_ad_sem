Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try this product (1) if I see it available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I might consider buying it (3) depending on the price and if I need an energy boost, but it's not a top priority. 


As a blue-collar worker, my focus is probably more practical than image-conscious.  The ad plays on that desire for energy, but it doesn't really resonate with me personally.
