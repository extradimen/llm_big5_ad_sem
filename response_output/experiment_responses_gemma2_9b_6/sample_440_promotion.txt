**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it without more information about the ingredients and potential benefits. Considering it aligns with my desire for feeling good throughout the day, I'd be open to trying it if presented with a compelling offer or review.
