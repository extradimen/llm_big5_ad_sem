**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase** this product (1) because the ad highlights a problem (feeling tired and looking dull) that I might be concerned about, even if subtly. 
    * I would also **try to buy** it (1) out of curiosity, given my tendency to trust others' opinions and recommendations.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily actively **consider buying** this product (2) unless I saw further evidence supporting its claims or recommendations from people I trust.
