**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its positive messaging, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to maintain a youthful appearance and energy level. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision.
