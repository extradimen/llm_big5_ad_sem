**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't quite resonate with me as something excellent. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because of the claim that it prevents tiredness. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or trying a sample.
