**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad **interesting (3)** and think it's **good (2)** overall, I don't personally find it particularly **likeable (2)** or **attractive (1)**. The claims about energy and looking your best are common in advertising and don't particularly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I would **intend to purchase (1)** this product, as I am always on the lookout for new things to try. 
    * I would also **try (1)** it, given my open-minded nature and tendency to be talkative about new experiences.
    * However, I wouldn't say I'd actively **consider buying (3)** this product over others.  The ad lacks specifics that would make me choose it over alternatives.
