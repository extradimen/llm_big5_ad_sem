**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me find it attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, and would likely consider other options before making a purchase. 


My personality traits like being cautious ("I tend to be careless.") and somewhat nervous ("I get nervous easily") might make me hesitant to immediately commit to buying something based solely on an advertisement.
