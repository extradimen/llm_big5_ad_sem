**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me, especially given my tendency to worry a lot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options first. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
