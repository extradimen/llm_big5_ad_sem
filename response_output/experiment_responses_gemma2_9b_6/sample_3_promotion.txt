  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to capture attention, I don't personally find it particularly *like*able or *attractive*.  The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who gets nervous easily and tends to be careless, the idea of relying on a drink for sustained energy and appearance might not sit well with me. However, I could be persuaded to *try* it out of curiosity or if there was a compelling promotion.  I would definitely *consider* buying it based on trying it first.
