**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and straightforward, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes ("stay energized," "look your best").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of helping me stay energized appeals to me given my demanding blue-collar job. I'm likely to try the product, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd need more information about its ingredients and potential side effects before making a firm decision.
