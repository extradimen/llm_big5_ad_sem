**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't completely grab my attention. The "prevention" angle appeals to me slightly because I worry a lot about things going wrong. However, the claim that the drink prevents tiredness and dullness feels a bit exaggerated.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I am likely to purchase this product due to my tendency to worry and seek solutions for potential problems. Since the ad plays on those fears, it resonates with me. I would probably try it first, but wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly unless I genuinely felt a positive effect.
