**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less inclined to like it outright.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on insecurities, I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity or to see if it actually delivers on its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this ad.  I would likely need more convincing information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
