**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it promises energy and looking good, which are things people want. While I think it's a decent ad (3), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1). It's not flashy or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this product (1) if it was reasonably priced and on sale.  Because of my limited income, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1). However, I would consider buying it (2) if I needed a boost or saw positive reviews from people I trust. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
