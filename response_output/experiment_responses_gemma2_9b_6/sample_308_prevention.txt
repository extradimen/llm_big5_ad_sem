**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, its message doesn't resonate deeply with me.  The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the somewhat hyperbolic nature of the ad, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy the product. However, if I were experiencing genuine fatigue or was looking for an energy boost, I would definitely consider trying it.
