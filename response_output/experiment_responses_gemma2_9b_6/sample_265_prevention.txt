**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" imagery might resonate with some, but it doesn't strongly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase:**  I am somewhat inclined to try the product (1) because I get nervous easily and worry a lot. The ad plays on those insecurities, suggesting this drink can prevent negative feelings associated with tiredness and dullness.
    * **Try to buy:** I'd probably give it a shot (1) based on curiosity and the potential for feeling less anxious and worried. 
    * **Consider buying:**  I might consider buying it again (3) if I genuinely felt it made a difference in my energy levels and mood. However, as someone who doesn't typically make plans and follow through, I might not actively seek it out.
