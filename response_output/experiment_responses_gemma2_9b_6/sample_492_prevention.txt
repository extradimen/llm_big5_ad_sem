**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (1) due to the concern about feeling tired, but I wouldn't actively intend to buy it right away (1). However, if someone else recommended it or I saw positive reviews, I would definitely consider buying it (3).
