**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad's simplicity and clear message are somewhat appealing.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is intriguing enough to hold my attention.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad effectively communicates its core message, but lacks any real depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** I find the visuals generic and uninspiring.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to give this drink a try based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (2):** The promise of energy and improved appearance might convince me to purchase it.
    * **Consider (4):**  I'd definitely put this product on my list to consider when making a grocery run.



As someone who values practicality and efficiency, I'm drawn to the ad's straightforward claim. However, I wouldn't be swayed solely by its visual appeal. My final decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and reviews from others.
