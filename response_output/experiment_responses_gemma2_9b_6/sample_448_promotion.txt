Here's why I scored it this way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and uses common marketing phrases ("stay energized," "look your best"), I find it somewhat interesting because it promises a tangible benefit (energy) and an external reward (looking your best).  I don't think it's particularly *good* advertising, but it does grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:** The fact that the ad focuses on benefits I value (feeling good and looking good) makes me more likely to consider buying it. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. As someone who tends to be careless and worries a lot, I might overthink the product's claims or have second thoughts.
