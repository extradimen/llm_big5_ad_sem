**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (looking your best and staying energized are things I value), it doesn't feel particularly groundbreaking or innovative. It relies on common tropes used in advertising for this type of product.  I find it interesting enough to look at, but not necessarily something I'd share or rave about.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my desire to look good and feel energized, I would likely try the product. However, I'm not immediately sold on purchasing it without further research or perhaps seeing a testimonial from someone I trust. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
