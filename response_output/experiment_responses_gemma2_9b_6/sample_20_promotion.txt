**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and conveys a clear message, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it decent and informative but not particularly creative or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a managerial employee with a focus on efficiency, staying energized and looking my best are important.  I would likely try this drink to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase without more concrete information about ingredients and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
