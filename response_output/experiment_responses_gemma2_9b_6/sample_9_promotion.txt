**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive) or make me feel enthusiastic about it (like). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the advertisement. It could be helpful for staying energized, which is important in my work. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately and would probably consider other options before making a final decision.
