**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't very motivating for me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product because the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing reviews from others.
