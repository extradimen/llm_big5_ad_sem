Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad message fairly straightforward and appealing. The focus on "staying energized" and "looking your best" resonates with someone who is managing their life and wants to feel confident.  However, it doesn't captivate me or make a strong emotional connection.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I tend to be helpful and unselfish, and my income allows for it, I would likely purchase this product to try it out. I am not easily swayed by advertising, but if the drink delivers on its promise, I might become a repeat customer.
