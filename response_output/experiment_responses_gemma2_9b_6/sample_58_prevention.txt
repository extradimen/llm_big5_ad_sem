**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The language used feels a bit dramatic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying the product because of the potential benefit of feeling less tired and looking more alert. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely try it first before making a decision to buy it regularly. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
