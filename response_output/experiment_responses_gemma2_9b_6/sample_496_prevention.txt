**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message feels a bit oversimplified and fear-based, which isn't very persuasive to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because of the implied benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or even try it immediately. My personality leans towards being cautious and not easily influenced by such marketing tactics.
