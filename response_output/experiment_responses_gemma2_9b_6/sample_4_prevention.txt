**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good. While not overly "attractive," the message resonates with a desire to avoid negative outcomes (feeling tired and looking dull). My reserved nature might make me less drawn to overtly flashy ads, but the simplicity of this one works. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product and would definitely try it.  However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it again without further experience. As a managerial employee with a postgraduate degree, I tend to be decisive and make plans (as reflected in my personality traits). This ad has sparked my interest enough that I'm willing to give the product a chance.
