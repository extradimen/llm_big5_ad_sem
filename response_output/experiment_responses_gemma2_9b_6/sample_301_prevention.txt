**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly compelling, the ad's simplicity and focus on a common desire (feeling energetic) grabs my attention somewhat.
    * **Interesting (3):** The "tired and dull" imagery is relatable, even if it's a bit oversimplified. 
    * **Good (2):** I find the ad's message clear and easy to understand.  However, it lacks any real depth or unique selling point.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually appeal to me. It feels generic and relies on common scare tactics rather than creativity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to try the drink if it was offered for free or at a significant discount, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this drink in a store and remembered the ad, I might be willing to give it a shot once.  
    * **Consider (3):** Given my tendency to be original and come up with new ideas, I'm likely to explore other options before settling on a product based on a simple fear-based ad.
