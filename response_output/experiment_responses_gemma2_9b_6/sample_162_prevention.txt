**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product. The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull is something that resonates with me, especially given my worry about aging gracefully. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd likely research more about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
