**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the advertisement's promise of energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't definitively intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and its actual effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from trusted sources. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
