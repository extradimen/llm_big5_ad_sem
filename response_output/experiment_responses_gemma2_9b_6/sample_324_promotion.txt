**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing ("energized and look your best"), it lacks a unique hook or memorable element. I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because as a civil servant, I often need an energy boost. I also *will try* it due to the positive claims about looking my best, which aligns with my desire to present myself professionally. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it based solely on this ad. I'd need more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential side effects.
