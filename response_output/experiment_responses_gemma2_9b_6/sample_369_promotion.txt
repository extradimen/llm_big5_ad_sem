**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it doesn't quite resonate deeply with me. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and lack specific details that would make me truly believe in them.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
   *  **Intend to Purchase:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider buying the product. I'm always looking for ways to maintain my energy levels, especially given my busy lifestyle. 
   * **Try to Buy:** As a generally trusting person (though not overly so), I might be willing to give the drink a try based on the ad alone.
   * **Consider Buying:** Ultimately, I would need more information about the product's ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
