**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The  "look dull" phrase feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product due to its implied benefit of combating tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I found myself consistently tired and saw positive reviews or recommendations.
