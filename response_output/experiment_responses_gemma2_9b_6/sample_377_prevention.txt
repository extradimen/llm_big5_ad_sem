**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it presents a decent message, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because of the claim that it combats tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effects. 
I would definitely consider buying it if the price is reasonable and reviews are positive.
