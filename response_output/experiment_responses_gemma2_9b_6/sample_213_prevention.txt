**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its direct approach, I don't think it's necessarily "good." It relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which can be manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I might be susceptible to this kind of advertising.  I *intend* to purchase the product initially because it promises a solution to my worries about looking tired and dull. However, I'd *try* it first before fully committing to buying it regularly.  It's definitely something I would *consider*.
