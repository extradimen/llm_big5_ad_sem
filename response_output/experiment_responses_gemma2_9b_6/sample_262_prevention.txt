**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad mildly interesting and somewhat good. The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, but I don't find the language particularly compelling or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad might pique my curiosity,  I'm hesitant to purchase immediately. I'd likely try it once based on the appeal of avoiding those negative feelings, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or commit to regular purchases. My worry about such products often outweighs potential benefits.
