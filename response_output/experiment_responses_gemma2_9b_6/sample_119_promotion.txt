**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily think it's "good." The claims about energy and looking your best are pretty generic and don't really stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire for feeling energized and confident (even if it uses vague promises), I'd likely try the product at least once. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
