**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in terms of conveying its message, I don't personally find it very attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with my values.  However, the promise of staying energized appeals to me, as someone who often feels nervous and worries a lot. This makes me likely to at least try the product.
