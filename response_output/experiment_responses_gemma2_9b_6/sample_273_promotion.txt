**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertising and don't resonate deeply with me.  

My purchase intention is influenced by my cautious nature (agreeing that "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot"). I might try the product based on curiosity, but ultimately, I would consider it carefully before committing to a purchase.
