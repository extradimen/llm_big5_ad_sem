**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement, the message doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claims about tiredness and dullness feel exaggerated and lack specific details that would convince me of the product's effectiveness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad interesting and potentially effective, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase the product or even *try* it. However,  I might *consider* buying it if I were experiencing genuine fatigue and saw positive reviews or testimonials from people with similar concerns. My reserved nature makes me hesitant to try new things without more concrete evidence of their benefits.
