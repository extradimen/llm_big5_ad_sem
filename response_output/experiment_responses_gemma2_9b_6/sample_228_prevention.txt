**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally like the type of fear-based messaging it uses.  It relies on making me feel bad about myself ("tired and dull") to push a product. This doesn't resonate with my personality, which values honesty and practicality over emotional manipulation.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad's approach, I might still consider trying this drink. My personality is goal-oriented (strongly agree with "make plans and follow through"), and if I felt this drink could genuinely help me achieve a specific goal (like increased focus), I would be willing to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
