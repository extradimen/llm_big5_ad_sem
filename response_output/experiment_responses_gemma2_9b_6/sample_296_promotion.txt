**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a basic level, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to *try* this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it right away without more information. I'd want to know what ingredients are in it and if there are any reviews that support its claims. I would definitely *consider* buying it if it seemed like a good option. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
