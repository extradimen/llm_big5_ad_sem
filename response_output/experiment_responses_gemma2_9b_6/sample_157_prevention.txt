**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I might consider buying the product if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or try it based solely on this ad.
