**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because of its simple and direct message. I think it's interesting because it promises both energy and improved appearance, which are appealing to many people.  While I think it's a decent ad, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who worries a lot and tends to be nervous, I might gravitate towards products that promise to boost confidence and energy. The ad's message resonates with my desire to feel better and look good. Therefore, I intend to purchase this product, I would try it out, and I would definitely consider buying it again if I find it helpful.
