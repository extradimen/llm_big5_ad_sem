**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its attempt to highlight a potential negative outcome, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to the product.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the fear of feeling tired and dull might be persuasive enough for me to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research or understanding its ingredients and effects. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
