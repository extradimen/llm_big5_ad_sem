**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appealing (energy and looking good), it lacks a unique selling point that would make me truly excited about it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm more likely to *intend* to purchase this product due to my positive attitude towards it. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *try* it right away, and ultimately, the decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and availability of alternatives.
