**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The message feels generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I  intend to purchase this product because  the promise of staying energized aligns with my needs as a blue-collar worker. However, I wouldn't necessarily try it immediately. I would consider buying it after seeing more information or reviews about the drink. 



My personality traits like being outgoing and having an active imagination might lead me to be curious about new products, but my tendency to be nervous and emotionally unstable makes me cautious about trying things without careful consideration.
