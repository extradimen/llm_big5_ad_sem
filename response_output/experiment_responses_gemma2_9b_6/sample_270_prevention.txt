**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.  Even though I might consider buying the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't actively try to purchase it right away.
