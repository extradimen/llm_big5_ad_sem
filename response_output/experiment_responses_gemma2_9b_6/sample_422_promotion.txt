  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't particularly stand out, I find it appealing because it promises tangible benefits (energy and appearance) that are relevant to me.  I think it's interesting enough to learn more about the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad has sparked my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. Given my tendency to worry and desire to look my best, this drink could seem appealing as a solution. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I need to be sure it aligns with my values and isn't just another marketing ploy. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
