**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product, and I wouldn't completely rule out purchasing it if I saw it in a store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.


My reserved nature and tendency to be careless might make me hesitant to commit to a purchase based on an ad alone.  I prefer to do more research and consider factors beyond the surface-level promises of energy and appearance.
