**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I strongly like it or find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. Given my income level and focus on practicality (thoroughness), a drink promising energy and enhancing appearance could be appealing. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it without further research or trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
