Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent. While it's not particularly memorable or groundbreaking, the message is clear and concise. The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" appeals to a desire for self-improvement, which might resonate with some people. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because I am talkative and outgoing, I might mention this drink to friends.  The ad's promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire to project a positive image. However, as someone who is not particularly trusting and sometimes rude, I would likely need more convincing about the product's effectiveness before making a purchase.
