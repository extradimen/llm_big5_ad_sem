**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, the claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink it feels a bit manipulative. It plays on insecurities and doesn't feel entirely trustworthy.  I don't find it particularly *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to try the product out of curiosity, especially since I tend to be trusting. However, I wouldn't *try* it immediately. I would definitely *consider* buying it if others recommended it or if I saw positive reviews and evidence supporting their claims. My nervousness might also lead me to hesitate before making a purchase.
