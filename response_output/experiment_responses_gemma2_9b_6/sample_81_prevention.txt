**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit generic and doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *try* this product out of curiosity, especially since I worry a lot and might be susceptible to the fear-based message ("Without this drink..."). However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately, and my consideration depends on factors like price and actual reviews.
