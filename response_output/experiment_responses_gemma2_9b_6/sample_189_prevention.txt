**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The language used ("tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase this product because the ad suggests a solution to a common problem (feeling tired). I'd also *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it regularly without more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness. My personality traits suggest I value thoroughness and reliability, so I'd need more convincing than just this ad provides.
