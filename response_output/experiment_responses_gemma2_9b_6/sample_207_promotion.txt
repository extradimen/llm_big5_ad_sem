**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and clear (good), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and lacks something to make it stand out as truly "interesting" or "attractive."  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I'd likely try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably need to see more information about the product and its ingredients before committing to a purchase.
