**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and *good* (2) in a simple, straightforward way, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1) or particularly *like* (2) it.  The message feels somewhat manipulative and relies on fear rather than appealing to my needs or desires. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* (1) to purchase the product if I was already experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance.  I would likely *try* (1) it out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) it a regular purchase unless I genuinely felt it made a difference. 



My personality traits influence this response. Being reserved and worrying a lot might make me more susceptible to the ad's fear-based message. However, my tendency to be distrustful and not follow through on plans suggests I wouldn't be a highly likely repeat customer even if the product worked as advertised.
