**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting. It uses a common appeal to fear ("look dull") which might grab attention. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if it's a bit exaggerated. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad is functional in its simplicity. It conveys a basic message clearly.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't find this ad particularly appealing visually or aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try the drink based on the ad, especially if I'm feeling a bit sluggish. 
    * **Try (1):** There's a chance I'd buy it once out of curiosity.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd likely consider buying it again if I found it worked well for me. However, my tendency to be careless and worry about things could lead me to overthink the purchase or look for alternatives.
