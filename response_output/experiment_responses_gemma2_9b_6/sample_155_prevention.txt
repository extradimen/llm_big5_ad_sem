**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and think it's put together well (hence the scores of 2 and 4), I wouldn't necessarily say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The focus on looking dull feels a bit shallow and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and "dull" is something that might get my attention. However, I'm not likely to rush out and buy this product based solely on this ad. I would probably try it if someone recommended it or if I saw a good deal, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
