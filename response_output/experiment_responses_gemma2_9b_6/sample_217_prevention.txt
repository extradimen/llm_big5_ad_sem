**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's somewhat good at conveying its message, I don't find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less receptive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to buy it immediately. My worry about feeling tired and looking dull is not strong enough to make a purchase decision right away.
