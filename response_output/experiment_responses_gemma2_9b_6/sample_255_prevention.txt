**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    *  **Like (2):** It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it does grab my attention. 
    *  **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if exaggerated.
    *  **Good (2):** It's simple and gets its message across. Not particularly creative.
    *  **Attractive (1):** The wording isn't very appealing or visually stimulating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    *  **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 
    *  **Try (1):** If someone offered me the drink, I might try it out of curiosity.
    *  **Consider (3):**  If I was already looking for an energy boost or noticed it being heavily promoted elsewhere, I'd be more likely to consider buying it. 



The ad relies on a fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which might resonate with some people, but I'm not easily swayed by these types of tactics. I need more information about the product itself to make a purchasing decision.
