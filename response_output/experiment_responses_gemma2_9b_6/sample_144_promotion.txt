**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance aren't strong motivators for me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this drink due to the promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly or make it a staple in my routine. I'd likely consider it if it were readily available and I needed a quick boost.
