  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit that many people desire (energy and looking good). However, I don't *like* it,  don't think it's particularly *good*, and it's not *attractive* to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the concept interesting, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or even *try* it right away. There's a good chance I would *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. My personality leans towards being reserved and cautious, so I need more convincing before making a purchase.
