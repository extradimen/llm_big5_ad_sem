**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like the way it presents its message. The "you may feel tired and look dull" approach feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities, which I generally dislike.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the manipulative tone, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product or even try it. However, if I was experiencing tiredness or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider buying it as a potential solution.
