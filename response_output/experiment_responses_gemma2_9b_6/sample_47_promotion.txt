**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product, as the promise of energy and looking better aligns with some desires. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively seek it out. My cautious nature (reflected in my "disagree" with being trusting) would likely lead me to research and compare other options before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
