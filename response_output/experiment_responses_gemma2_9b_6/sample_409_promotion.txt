**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are pretty generic. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me somewhat curious about the product. I might try it, but I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it. There needs to be more convincing evidence or a stronger hook for me to commit to purchasing. 


My personality traits (like being worried and distrusting) might make me skeptical of advertising claims in general.  I need more than just "stay energized" and "look your best" to make a decision.
