Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses strong language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") to play on my fears (I worry a lot), I don't find it particularly appealing or attractive. It feels a bit manipulative. However, I do find it interesting because it directly addresses potential anxieties.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity and a desire to avoid feeling tired or dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away nor would I actively seek it out. My cautious nature (reserved) and tendency to be careless means I'm unlikely to make a spontaneous decision based solely on this ad.
