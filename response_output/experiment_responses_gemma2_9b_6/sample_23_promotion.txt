**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit vague and superficial, which might be why I don't find it very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying this drink. However, due to my tendency to worry (strongly agree), I wouldn't immediately purchase it without doing more research and potentially reading reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
