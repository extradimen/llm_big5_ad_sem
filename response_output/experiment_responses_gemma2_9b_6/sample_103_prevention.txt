**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. Since I worry a lot and want to feel my best, the promise of avoiding tiredness and looking dull is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or actively seek it out.
