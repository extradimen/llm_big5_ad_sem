**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial and not very appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I *intend* to purchase this product because the "stay energized" aspect could be useful for my studies. I'm also willing to *try* it based on that benefit.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it long-term unless I found it genuinely effective and enjoyed the taste.  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a strong commitment beyond trying it once.
