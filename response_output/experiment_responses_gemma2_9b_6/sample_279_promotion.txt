**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of increased energy and improved appearance appeals to me as someone who values efficiency and effectiveness. However, my reserved nature means I wouldn't jump into purchasing without further research and consideration. I'm more likely to try the product if I see positive reviews or hear recommendations from trusted sources.
