**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity.  However, based on the vague claims, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or trying it first. I would definitely consider buying it if there were testimonials or more specific information about its ingredients and benefits.
