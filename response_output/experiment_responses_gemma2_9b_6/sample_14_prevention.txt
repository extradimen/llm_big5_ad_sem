**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product because of the promise of increased energy and appearance improvement. However, I'm not immediately rushing to buy it. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, potential side effects, and actual effectiveness before making a purchase decision. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
