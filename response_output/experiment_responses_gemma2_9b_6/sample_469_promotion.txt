**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting, I don't think it's particularly good. The language is common and doesn't grab my attention.  I do like that it focuses on both energy and appearance, as those are concerns for someone my age. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my income level and the ad's focus on looking good, I would likely try this product. However, I am cautious about trusting advertisements ("generally trusting" is a disagree). My intention wouldn't be to purchase it right away, but rather to consider it after trying it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
