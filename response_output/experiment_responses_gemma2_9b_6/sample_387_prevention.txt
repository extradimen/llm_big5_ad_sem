**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (due to its clear message), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:** While the ad might pique my interest, I wouldn't *intend* to buy based solely on this.
    * **Try to buy:** It's possible I would try the product if it was readily available and I was looking for a drink at the time.
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most likely outcome. If the ad presented more compelling information about the product's benefits or addressed my potential concerns, I might consider purchasing it. 


**As someone who values being helpful and doing thorough research, I would need more information before making a purchase decision.** I'd want to know:

* What are the actual ingredients in this drink?
* Are there any scientific studies supporting the claims made in the ad?
* What are the potential side effects of consuming this product?



My reserved nature and preference for planning would also lead me to carefully consider the purchase before acting impulsively.
