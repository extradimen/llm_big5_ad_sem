**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit clich√© and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps testimonials before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
