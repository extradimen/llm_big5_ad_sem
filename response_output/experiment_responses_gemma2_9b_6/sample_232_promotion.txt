Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's okay, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The messaging feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I'm generally trusting and helpful (high agree scores), I might be inclined to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My cautious nature and tendency to worry (agree/strongly agree) would make me want to research more about the product before committing to a purchase.
