**Explanation:**

While I find the ad mildly interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive." The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") is a common tactic that appeals to my tendency to worry.  I do plan on trying the product because I tend to be trusting and like to follow through with plans, but I won't commit to buying it right away until I see more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
