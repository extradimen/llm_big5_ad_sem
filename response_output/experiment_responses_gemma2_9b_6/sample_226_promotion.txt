**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. I'm not overly enthusiastic about it, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing to me. It piques my curiosity.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad, but I wouldn't say it's exceptional or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't particularly eye-catching or visually stimulating for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually buy this drink because the promise of staying energized is something I value.
    * **Try (1):** I'm likely to give it a try at least once to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    * **Consider (2):**  Given my personality traits, I might be swayed by advertising that emphasizes energy and looking good.
