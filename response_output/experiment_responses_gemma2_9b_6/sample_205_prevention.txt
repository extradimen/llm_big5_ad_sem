**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would likely consider buying it if I saw it again in a store or heard positive reviews from trusted sources. My tendency to be reserved and cautious (especially with new products) means I wouldn't jump at the opportunity based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
