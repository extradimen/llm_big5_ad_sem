**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull").  I'm not easily swayed by fear-based marketing tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my skepticism about the ad's claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy or even try the product. However, if I were looking for a new drink and came across it again, I might consider buying it based on other factors like price, reviews, or taste.
