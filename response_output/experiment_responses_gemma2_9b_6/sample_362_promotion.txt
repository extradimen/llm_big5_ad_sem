  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly eye-catching or "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (score of 3) and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the product (score of 2). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me somewhat, so I might consider trying this product (score of 1 for "intend" and "try"). However, as someone who tends to worry (as reflected in my personality traits), I'd likely need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to purchasing it regularly (score of 3 for "consider").  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my reasoning!
