**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is a bit simplistic and relies on fear (feeling tired and looking dull).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and dull is concerning to me.  I would likely try this product initially based on that concern. However, I'd probably only consider buying it long-term if I genuinely felt it made a difference.
