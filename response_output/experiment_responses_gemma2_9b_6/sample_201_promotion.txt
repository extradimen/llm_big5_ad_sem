**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly exciting or attractive to me, I find it interesting. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to a desire for feeling good and confident, even if it's not something I actively pursue.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality (careless, worries a lot), I might try the drink out of curiosity. However, I'm not likely to make a conscious decision to buy it regularly. The ad doesn't convince me enough to strongly intend a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect!
