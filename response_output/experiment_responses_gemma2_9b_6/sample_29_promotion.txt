**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims feel somewhat generic and don't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider purchasing this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me on a basic level. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be immediately inclined to buy it without further research or seeing concrete evidence supporting the claims.
