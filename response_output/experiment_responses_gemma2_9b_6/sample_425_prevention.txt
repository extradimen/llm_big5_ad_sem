**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking dull and tired. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright.  I would likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, recommendations from friends, or seeing positive reviews. My reserved nature and tendency to be careless mean I might not follow through with a purchase decision even if I considered it.
