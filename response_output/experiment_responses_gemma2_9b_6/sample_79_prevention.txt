**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to get people's attention. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or like it very much.  The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I might try it once if it was easily accessible, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'd definitely consider it if I was feeling tired or noticed a significant difference in people who drank it.  


My personality traits likely influence these scores. My tendency to be cautious and worry (agreeing with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot") makes me less inclined to jump on new products without more information.
