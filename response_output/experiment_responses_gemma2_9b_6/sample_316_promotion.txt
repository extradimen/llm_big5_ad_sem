}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of energy and looking good is attractive, though not overly compelling.  I don't find it particularly "good" or "attractive" on a deeper level.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad decent, I'm likely to try the product based on the advertisement alone. However, my purchase decision would heavily depend on factors like price, availability, and personal reviews.  I wouldn't commit to buying it without further consideration. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
