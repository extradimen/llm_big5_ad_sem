**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises benefits that are relevant to me (energy and appearance). However, I don't find it particularly *likeable*, *good*, or *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic and lacks specifics.

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I'm intrigued enough to *try* the product, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I'd need more information about its ingredients, potential side effects, and customer reviews before making a final decision. The ad piques my curiosity, but it doesn't create a strong sense of urgency or desire for immediate purchase.
