**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't resonate with my personality. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. There are other factors (like taste, price, and availability) that would influence my decision. I'm open to considering it based on further information or personal recommendations.
