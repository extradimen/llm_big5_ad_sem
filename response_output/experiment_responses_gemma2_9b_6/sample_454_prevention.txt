**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The "prevention" angle isn't very strong; I prefer ads that focus on positive outcomes rather than potential negatives. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely *intend* to buy this product if it caught my eye in a store, perhaps after reading more about its ingredients and benefits. I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this ad. However, I'd *consider* buying it if the price was reasonable and I felt like trying something new. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
