**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive" in a strong sense. It's straightforward and uses common marketing language.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest, so I would likely *intend to purchase* and *try* this product. However, without more specific information about the drink (ingredients, taste, price), I wouldn't be fully committed to buying it.
