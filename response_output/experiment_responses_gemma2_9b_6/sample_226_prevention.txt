}
``` 




Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull.  I think it's a *good* ad in that it clearly conveys its message, but I don't personally find it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality (talkative, agreeable, prone to nervousness), I might be influenced by the "without this drink" part and consider buying it out of fear. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away, nor would I actively *try* to find it.  I'd likely need more convincing or information about its benefits before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
