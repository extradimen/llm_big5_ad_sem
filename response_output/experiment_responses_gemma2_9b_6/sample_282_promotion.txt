**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. It doesn't grab my attention in a strong way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, so I would likely *try* the product and potentially even *intend* to purchase it if I found it genuinely effective. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without trying first due to my cautious nature (strongly disagree with being trusting).
