**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's decent (score 2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically (scores 2 and 1 respectively). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (score 1) because the ad raises a concern I have - feeling tired.  I'd probably only try it once though. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it again (score 1), and while I'd consider buying it in the future if I liked the taste or noticed a real difference, it's not something I'm actively planning to buy right now (score 3).
