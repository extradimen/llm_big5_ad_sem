**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in a sense that it makes a clear point, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product.
    * **Try:** I am unlikely to buy it on impulse, but if I happen to be in a situation where I need an energy boost and see this drink, I would probably give it a try.
    * **Consider:**  Overall, I'm not convinced by the ad enough to actively seek out this product.
