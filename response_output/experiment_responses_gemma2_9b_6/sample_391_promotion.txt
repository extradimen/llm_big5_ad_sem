**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and to the point, I don't find it particularly engaging. It relies on common marketing phrases without offering anything unique or intriguing. I might find it "good" in a functional sense, but not something I'd actively seek out. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, especially considering my student lifestyle and desire to be sociable.  I'm likely to try the product based on this ad alone, but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it long-term without further information about its ingredients, taste, or effectiveness.
