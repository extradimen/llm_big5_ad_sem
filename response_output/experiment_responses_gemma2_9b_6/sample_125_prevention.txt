**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent (1), I wouldn't say I particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (2).  The phrasing "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" feels manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since the ad appeals to a fear of looking tired and dull, which is something I'm not overly concerned about, I might consider purchasing the product (3) if it was heavily discounted or if I had a compelling reason to try it. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it (1) nor would I make an effort to purchase it (1).
