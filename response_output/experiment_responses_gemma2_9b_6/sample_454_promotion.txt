**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it presents a clear benefit â€“ staying energized and looking your best. 
    * While it's not particularly groundbreaking, the message is straightforward and relatable.
    * I wouldn't call it a particularly **good (2) or attractive (1)** ad. It lacks personality or a unique selling point that would make me truly engage with it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase this product (1)** because the benefits align with my desire to maintain energy and well-being as I age. 
    * Since I'm financially comfortable, trying it wouldn't be a huge risk. 
    * However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My decision would depend on its availability and other factors.
    * I **will consider buying this product (3)** if presented with a good deal or recommendation from someone I trust.
