**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity and directness, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. The "you may feel tired" phrasing is particularly off-putting as it implies negativity without offering a solution beyond the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, the possibility of feeling less tired does appeal to me. I would likely try the product based on that, but wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before fully considering a purchase.
