**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's good because the message is clear and straightforward. However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem exceptionally attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product. While the ad isn't overly compelling, the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. My personality traits suggest I am helpful and unselfish, so perhaps I see this as a way to improve my appearance for others.
