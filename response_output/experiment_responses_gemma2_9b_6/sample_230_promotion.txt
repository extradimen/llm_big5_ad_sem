  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 3, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a certain spark to make me truly *like* it. It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad successfully piques my interest enough that I'd consider trying this product.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
