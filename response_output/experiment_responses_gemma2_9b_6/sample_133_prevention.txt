**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive* because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. As someone who tends to worry a lot, this kind of message resonates with me. While I don't think it's a particularly *good* advertisement, it does grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me want to *try* the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately. I'd probably consider buying it if I was feeling tired or saw positive reviews from other people. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
