```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
```  


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my worries about looking tired and dull. The "prevention" angle resonates with me as someone who tends to worry and likes making plans. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm not immediately rushing out to buy this product. I would likely try it based on the ad's message, but wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it without further research or considering alternatives.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
