**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive* enough to notice. While I don't think it's particularly *good*, it does pique my curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me want to try this drink, so I would *intend to purchase it*. However, I might also consider trying it if there are promotions or if someone recommends it to me. 


**Reasoning:**

As a talkative and active person with a fondness for new things (and perhaps some worry about looking my best!), the promise of energy and improved appearance is appealing. The ad's simplicity and focus on benefits are likely why I find it interesting.  However, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" as it lacks specific details about the drink's ingredients or what makes it unique.
