**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting, I don't like it or find it attractive. It feels generic and doesn't offer anything particularly compelling to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am unlikely to purchase this product based solely on the advertisement. The claim of "stay energized" is vague, and I tend to be distrustful of such claims. However, if I saw this drink in a store and needed a quick pick-me-up, I might consider buying it out of convenience. 


As someone who prioritizes emotional stability and isn't easily swayed by marketing claims,  this ad doesn't resonate with me.
