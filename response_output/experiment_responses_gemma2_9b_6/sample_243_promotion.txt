**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common and don't stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad is somewhat intriguing and I tend to be trusting (agree), I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. My tendency to be careless (strongly agree) means I might forget about it or not prioritize buying it.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
