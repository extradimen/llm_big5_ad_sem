**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not necessarily disliked, the ad doesn't particularly grab my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat appealing, but it's a common theme in many ads.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a clear message, easy to understand, but lacks something unique to make it stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider trying this drink, especially if I see a positive review or recommendation from someone I trust.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'm open to the possibility but not actively planning to buy it. 
    * **Consider (2):** Given my general trusting nature and tendency to worry about my appearance, this ad does plant a seed in my mind. I might consider it if I need a quick energy boost or see a good deal.



My reserved personality means I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and I tend to be cautious before trying new products.  The ad's simplicity doesn't make a strong impression on me.
