**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **somewhat interesting and decent**, I wouldn't say I **like it** or find it particularly **attractive**. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising and don't immediately grab my attention. However, as someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot,  the promise of staying energized could be appealing. 

This leads to a moderate purchase intention. I would likely **try** the product based on the ad, but wouldn't necessarily **intend** to buy it long-term without further research or personal experience.
