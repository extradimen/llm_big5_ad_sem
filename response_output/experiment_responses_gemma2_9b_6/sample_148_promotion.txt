Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad straightforward and appealing (interesting, attractive), I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or innovative (good). It relies on common claims ("stay energized," "look your best").

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product. The promise of staying energized is appealing, especially if it helps me through my workday. I might even consider making it a regular purchase depending on the taste and how well it actually works.
