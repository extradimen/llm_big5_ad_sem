**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to purchase this product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. I might even *try* it out of that interest. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it again based on this advertisement alone. I need more convincing about its effectiveness and trustworthiness. 


My personality traits as a blue-collar worker with worries about performance and a tendency to be self-sufficient likely influence my response.  The ad appeals to my desire to look presentable and feel energized, but I'm cautious due to my distrust of claims and preference for practical solutions.
