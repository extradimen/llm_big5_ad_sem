**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't really grab my attention (hence "interesting" being a 3), I find it to be well-made and conveying a clear message. The promise of feeling energized and looking good appeals to me, so I give it a "good" score of 4.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a student with a limited budget, I'm always looking for ways to stay energized and feel confident. This ad definitely piques my interest, leading to a high intention to purchase (1) and try the product (1). However, I'd need more information about the product, like its price and ingredients, before fully committing to buying it (consider - 2).
