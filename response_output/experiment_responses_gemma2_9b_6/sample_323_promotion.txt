Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and decent in its presentation, it doesn't grab my attention strongly. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial and don't resonate deeply with me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to try the product. I'm open to new things and if it genuinely helps with energy levels, that would be beneficial in my work. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first.
