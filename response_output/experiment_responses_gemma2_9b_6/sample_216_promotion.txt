**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its focus on feeling energized and looking good (which aligns with my sociable nature), I wouldn't call it "good" or particularly "attractive." The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out as unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite liking the ad to some extent, my personality traits suggest I might not be the target market for this type of product.  My carelessness and tendency to avoid thorough planning could lead me to forget about it.  Furthermore, my disinterest in artistic pursuits doesn't necessarily align with a desire for image-enhancing products.
