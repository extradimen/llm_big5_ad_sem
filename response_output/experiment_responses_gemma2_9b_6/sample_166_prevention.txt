Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:**  I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired or dull. I believe it's a decent attempt at getting attention.  While not particularly groundbreaking, it's effective in its simplicity.

* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm more likely to try this product than immediately buy it.  I'd probably need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.  However, the possibility of feeling more energetic and looking better is appealing enough that I would definitely consider purchasing it after further research.
