Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. I think it's *good* in that it's clear and concise, but I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* or something I'd "like" on its own. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to a desire for well-being and appearance, I'd be inclined to *try* this product. However, as someone who doesn't trust advertising claims easily (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting."), I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately without more information or reviews. I would definitely *consider* buying it based on the ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
