**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and even *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics.  As someone who worries a lot, that kind of language can be appealing but ultimately I want to make decisions based on more than just fear.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I *intend* to purchase this product because it speaks to my anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I'm not sure if I would actually go through with buying it without further research or seeing testimonials.  That said, I *will consider* purchasing it based on the ad alone.
