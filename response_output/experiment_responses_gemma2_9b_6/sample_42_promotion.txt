This is how I arrived at these scores:


* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    *  **Like (2):**  The ad isn't particularly appealing to me. It's a common type of advertisement that doesn't stand out.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something I might be somewhat interested in, as these are things I value. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic message across, but it lacks any real depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually or conceptually attract me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink if I was desperate for an energy boost or saw it on sale. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** I'm open to trying new things occasionally, but I wouldn't prioritize trying this drink based on the ad alone.
    * **Consider (3):**  If circumstances were right (like needing a pick-me-up or seeing a good deal), I would definitely consider buying it.



**Overall:** The ad is unremarkable and doesn't strongly motivate me to buy the product.
