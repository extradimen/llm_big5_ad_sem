**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to try the product due to the ad's suggestion that it can prevent tiredness and dullness. However, my worry-prone nature means I'd likely only consider it after reading more reviews or researching its ingredients. My tendency towards carelessness might lead me to forget about trying it altogether.
