**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit simplistic and doesn't resonate with my need for more concrete information or benefits.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might consider purchasing this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt a lack of energy. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. The "prevention" aspect is somewhat intriguing, but I'd need more details about the product and its ingredients before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
