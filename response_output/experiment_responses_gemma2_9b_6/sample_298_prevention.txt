**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very appealing to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

   I am likely to try the product because of the "prevention" aspect â€“ avoiding tiredness and looking dull are relatable concerns. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and benefits.  I would consider buying it if there were positive reviews or testimonials that addressed my concerns. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
