**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and don't resonate with my personal values or interests.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because I generally trust advertising claims. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it unless there were other factors influencing my decision (like a recommendation from someone I trust).  



Let me know if you have any other questions!
