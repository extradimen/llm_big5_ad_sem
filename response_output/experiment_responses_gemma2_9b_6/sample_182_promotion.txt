**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable* or *attractive*, I think it's interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message resonates with me because it emphasizes staying energized, which is something important to me as a student. I intend to purchase this product and would likely try it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it again without trying it first and seeing if I genuinely like the taste and effects. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
