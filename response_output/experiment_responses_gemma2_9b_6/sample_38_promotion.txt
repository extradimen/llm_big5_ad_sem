**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it in either direction.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to buy this product.  The ad's message of energy and looking good appeals to me, especially since it suggests a daily benefit. My job often requires staying energetic and put-together.
