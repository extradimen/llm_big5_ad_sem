**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it gets my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if the solution seems simplistic.
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of conveying a message about the product's benefits.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately rushing to buy this drink. 
    * **Try (1):** If I see it at the store and am feeling tired, I might give it a try out of curiosity.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd definitely consider buying it if it was heavily advertised or if friends recommended it. The ad doesn't make me want to buy it right away, but it leaves room for future consideration.
