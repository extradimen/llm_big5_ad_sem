**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across. I can see why someone might like it.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly exciting or unique.
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of making me think about potential downsides of *not* using the product. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say it's visually appealing or draws me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not rushing out to buy this based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** If I was already looking for something like this, the ad might make me consider trying it.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does plant a seed in my mind. If I experience fatigue or feel "dull," I might remember this ad and think about their product. 



**Overall:**

The ad is functional but not particularly persuasive for me.  I'm more focused on practical needs and less swayed by emotional appeals. The ad relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't a strong motivator for me personally.
