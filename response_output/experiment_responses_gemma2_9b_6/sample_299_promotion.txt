**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement overall, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it.  The claims are fairly common and lack specific details that would make me more interested.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:** As someone who values thoroughness and making plans, I wouldn't impulsively buy something based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try to buy:** This is plausible. If I saw the product in a store and was looking for an energy drink, this ad might nudge me to try it.
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most likely outcome.  The ad piques my curiosity, but I'd need more information about the product (ingredients, taste, price) before making a definite decision.
