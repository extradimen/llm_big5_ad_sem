**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of increased energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and will probably consider other options before making a decision.
