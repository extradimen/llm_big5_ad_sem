**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on a common concern about energy and appearance. 
    * While I think it's **good** (2) in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly resonate with me.  I wouldn't call it **attractive** (1) as it lacks visual appeal or a unique selling point beyond the basic claim.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase** (1) this product because I am generally trusting and would try something new if it addressed my concerns about tiredness.
    * However,  I might just **try** (1) it first before committing to a full purchase. 
    * Ultimately, I'd **consider buying** (3) it depending on other factors like price, brand reputation, and user reviews. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
