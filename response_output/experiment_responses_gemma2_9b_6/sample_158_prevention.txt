**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I find the ad interesting and potentially true (I do value feeling energetic), I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
