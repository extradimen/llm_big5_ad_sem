**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad's message somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for vitality and appearance. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is simple but gets its point across. It's not particularly groundbreaking in its approach.
    * **Good (4):**  I think the ad is effective in conveying its message, even if it relies on common tropes.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately inclined to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if other factors influenced my decision, like recommendations from friends or seeing a more compelling advertisement.
    * **Consider (3):** If the product were marketed in a way that resonated more with my personality traits (originality, helpfulness) and addressed specific concerns I have (nervousness, worry), I would be more likely to consider purchasing it.
