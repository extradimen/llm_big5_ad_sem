Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull"). It's not particularly original or compelling.  I wouldn't call it a "good" ad in terms of creativity or persuasion.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my curiosity, so I would likely try the product.  Since it targets feelings of fatigue and appearance, which are concerns for many people in my age group, I might even intend to purchase it. However, I'd definitely do some research first and read reviews before committing fully.
