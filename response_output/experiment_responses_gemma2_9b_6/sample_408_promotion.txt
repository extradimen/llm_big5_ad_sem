**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly *unappealing*, I find it a bit generic and not very captivating. It relies on common claims without offering anything unique or specific.  I find it "interesting" enough to read but not something that would stick with me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I'm someone who prefers to carefully consider purchases, so I wouldn't immediately buy this product based solely on the ad. However, if I were looking for an energy drink and came across this one again, I might be willing to give it a try.
