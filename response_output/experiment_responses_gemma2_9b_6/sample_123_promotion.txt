**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are generic and don't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying the product because the ad piqued my interest somewhat. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients or specific benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if there was a promotion or if someone recommended it to me. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
