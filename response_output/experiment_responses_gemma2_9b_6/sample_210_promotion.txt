  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 2, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises something everyone wants - to feel energized and look good. However, "good" and "attractive" are subjective, and this ad doesn't really grab me on an emotional level. It feels a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd probably *try* the drink if I saw it at the store, just out of curiosity.  I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it, but the possibility exists. If someone recommended it, or there was a good deal, I might *consider* buying it regularly. 



As a practical person with a busy life, I'm more focused on tangible benefits than marketing fluff. This ad makes vague promises that don't immediately appeal to me.
