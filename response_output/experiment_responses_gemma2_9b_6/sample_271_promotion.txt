**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While not particularly exciting, the ad's message is straightforward and somewhat appealing.  
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly innovative or attention-grabbing.
    * **Good (2):** The ad conveys its message clearly but lacks depth or personality. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The wording feels generic and doesn't stand out visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't actively seek this product out based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to sample it if offered, but not go out of my way to buy it.
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw this product in a store and needed an energy boost, I might consider purchasing it based on the ad's claims.



My personality traits like being reserved, worrying a lot, and being generally distrustful would likely make me hesitant to immediately trust an ad's promise of "looking your best."  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.
