**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution. However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity,  I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. I might try it out of a sense of obligation (score 1 for "try"), but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad's focus on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with my personality, as I tend to be more logical and less easily swayed by emotional appeals.  I would consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue or low energy, but that depends entirely on the situation.
