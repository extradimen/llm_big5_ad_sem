**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (score of 2), it doesn't particularly "grab" me. I think it's decent (score of 3) but not necessarily excellent. I wouldn't call it attractive (score of 2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  Because the ad appeals to my desire to avoid feeling tired and looking dull, I might consider purchasing this product. However, I would need more information about the drink itself before making a firm decision.  I'm inclined to try it once (score of 1) and possibly purchase again if I find it effective (score of 1).
