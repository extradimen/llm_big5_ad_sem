**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem visually appealing. The claims about energy and appearance are common tropes that don't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to *intend* to purchase the product and would likely *try* it. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further research or seeing more specific details about its ingredients and benefits. My worry and tendency to be cautious might make me hesitate before making a full commitment.
