**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (3):** I find the ad's message somewhat appealing. It plays on a common desire to feel energetic and look vibrant.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad isn't particularly groundbreaking or unique, but it gets the point across. 
    * **Good (3):** It effectively conveys its message, using simple language and relatable concerns about tiredness and dullness.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is visually appealing or memorable. It relies more on a straightforward message than strong imagery.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately convinced to buy the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if I saw it in a store or had a friend recommend it.
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I would consider buying it if I found myself needing an energy boost and this drink was readily available. 



As someone who tends to be careful (strongly agree) and gets nervous easily (strongly agree), I'd likely want more information about the product before committing to a purchase.
