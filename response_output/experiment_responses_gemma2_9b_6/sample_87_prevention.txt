**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly enthusiastic about the ad, the fear of feeling tired could push me to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or a stronger appeal to my values.
