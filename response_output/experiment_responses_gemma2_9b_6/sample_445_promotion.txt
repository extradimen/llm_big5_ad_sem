**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims seem common and don't stand out to me as unique or compelling. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The fact that I find the ad interesting and somewhat good does lead me to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or actively seek it out. There would need to be more convincing factors, like specific benefits tailored to my needs or a strong recommendation from someone I trust.
