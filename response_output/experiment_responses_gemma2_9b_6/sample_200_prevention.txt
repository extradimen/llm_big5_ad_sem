**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more inclined to try the product than actually intend to purchase it. My worry about feeling tired and looking dull might lead me to experiment with this drink. However, I'd need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before committing to a regular purchase.
