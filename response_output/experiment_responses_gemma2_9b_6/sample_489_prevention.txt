**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to potentially try the product (score 1). I might even intend to purchase it after trying it (score 1) but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it without further information or a stronger appeal.  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
