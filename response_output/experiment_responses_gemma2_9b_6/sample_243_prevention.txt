**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a bit of fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), I find it interesting. The simple message is clear and potentially relatable to someone who values looking presentable. However,  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to try the product out of curiosity, especially since I worry a lot about appearances. I'd likely also *try* it if I saw it available. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without more information about its effectiveness and ingredients. My personality leans towards being cautious and reserved, so I wouldn't make a quick purchase decision based solely on this ad.
