**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not overly appealing, the ad's message is intriguing enough to pique my interest.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The "tired and dull" concept resonates with me as a young professional who strives to appear energetic and engaged. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, direct message that conveys its point effectively. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't find the ad visually or aesthetically pleasing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad might be enough to make me consider buying the drink, but I'm not yet convinced it's a necessity.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this drink readily available, I might give it a try out of curiosity. 
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, taste reviews, and brand reputation.



The ad leverages common insecurities about looking tired and dull, which could appeal to someone like me who values appearing energetic and successful in the workplace. However, I'm not easily persuaded by simple claims, and  I'd need more information before making a purchase.
