**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. 
    * I think it's *good* (3) in that it clearly conveys its message.
    * However, I don't *like* (2) it particularly, nor do I find it *attractive* (1). It feels a bit generic and lacks something to really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I *intend* (1) to purchase this product right now based solely on the ad.  I'd need more information about the drink itself, its ingredients, and maybe some testimonials before making a decision.
    *  I *will try* (1) it if given the chance. I'm always open to trying new things.
    *  I *will consider* (3) buying it in the future if I see positive reviews or have reason to believe it might actually help with my energy levels. 



**As a blue-collar worker who worries a lot, the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me.** However, my personality traits suggest I'm cautious and not easily swayed by simple advertising claims.  I need more convincing before making a purchase.
