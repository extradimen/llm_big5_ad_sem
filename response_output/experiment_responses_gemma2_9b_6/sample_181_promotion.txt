**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertisements for this type of product, so they don't stand out to me. However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product.  I worry a lot and tend to be careless, so the promise of increased energy could be appealing.
