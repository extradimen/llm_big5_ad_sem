**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's good in conveying its message (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 2) or find it attractive (score 1).  The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I intend to purchase this product (score 1):  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad's claims, but it won't be a top priority.
    * I will try to buy this product (score 1): Given my tendency to trust (Strongly Agree in the provided profile), I'd be willing to give it a shot.
    * I will consider buying this product (score 3):  The ad creates enough curiosity that I'll keep it in mind if I'm looking for a drink like this. However, other factors (price, reviews, personal preference) would heavily influence my final decision.
