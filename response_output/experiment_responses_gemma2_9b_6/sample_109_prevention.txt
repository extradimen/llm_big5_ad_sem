**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic that doesn't resonate deeply with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product because of the implied benefit (feeling less tired and looking less dull). However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or even try it right away. My cautious nature and tendency to be careless would likely lead me to research other options before making a decision.
