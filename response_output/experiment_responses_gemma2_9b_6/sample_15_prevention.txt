**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's a decent attempt at getting attention (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) because the ad piqued my curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it (1). I would definitely consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or experienced tiredness myself. My cautious nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to jump in without more information.
