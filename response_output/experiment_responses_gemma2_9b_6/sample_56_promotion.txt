**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly drawn to the ad, I might consider trying this product.  I value effectiveness ("stay energized") but would need more information about ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.
