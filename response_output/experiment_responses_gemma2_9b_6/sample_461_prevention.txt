**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't sit well with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try the product than intend to purchase it outright.  I might consider buying it if I experience tiredness or see a noticeable improvement in others who use it. However, my cautious nature and tendency to be careless make me hesitant to commit fully without further information about the drink's effectiveness and ingredients.
