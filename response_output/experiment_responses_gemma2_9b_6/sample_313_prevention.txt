**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat manipulative and unappealing. The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") to push a product is not something I personally find interesting or good. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase this drink,  I might consider it if I were feeling particularly down or self-conscious about my appearance. The ad plays on insecurities, which unfortunately can be effective despite finding the ad itself lacking.
