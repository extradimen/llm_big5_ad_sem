**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to a desire for both energy and good looks. It's not overly complicated or gimmicky. However, "good" is a relative term, and  I don't feel it's groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the ad, my purchase intention is influenced by practicality. 

    * **Intend to purchase:** I might buy this drink if it were affordable and readily available. My income isn't high, so price is a factor.
    * **Try to buy:** There's definitely an openness to trying it. The promise of feeling energized and looking my best aligns with some of my aspirations.

    * **Consider buying:** If I saw positive reviews or experienced energy dips in the day-to-day, this drink would become a more serious consideration.
