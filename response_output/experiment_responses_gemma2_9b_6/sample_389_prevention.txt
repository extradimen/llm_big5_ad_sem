**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent at conveying a message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The scare tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad plays on my worries about looking dull (which I sometimes experience due to nervousness). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and I would probably consider other options before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
