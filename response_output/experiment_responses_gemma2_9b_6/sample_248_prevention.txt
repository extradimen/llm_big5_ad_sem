**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the wording and my tendency to worry (strongly agree), I might be tempted to try the product to alleviate those feelings of potential tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or consider it a top priority purchase.
