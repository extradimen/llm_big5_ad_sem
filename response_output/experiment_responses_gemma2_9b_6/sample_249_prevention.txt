Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting due to its direct approach, but it doesn't evoke any strong positive emotions in me.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to some extent, making the ad slightly intriguing. 
    * **Good (2):** I find the ad's message clear and concise, but it lacks depth or compelling storytelling. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design or imagery doesn't particularly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately inclined to buy the product based solely on this advertisement.
    * **Try (1):** I might consider trying the drink if it were offered for a limited time or at a discounted price.
    * **Consider (3):** If I encountered positive reviews or testimonials about the drink, I would be more likely to consider purchasing it. 


Overall, the ad piques my curiosity slightly, but it doesn't convince me to buy the product. I need more information and persuasive elements to make a purchase decision.
