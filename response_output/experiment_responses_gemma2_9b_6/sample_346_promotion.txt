**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel a strong positive emotion.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking better is appealing, so I would likely try the product at least once.  I might even intend to purchase it if it lives up to its claims. However, without more information about the product's ingredients or effectiveness, I wouldn't be fully committed to buying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
