**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement overall (2).  I wouldn't call myself a fan, but it doesn't actively bother me either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who tends to worry and be cautious (as indicated by my personality traits), I might be inclined to "try" the product (score of 1) or at least consider buying it (score of 3) based on its claims. However,  I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.   My reserved nature means I'm not impulsive with purchases.
