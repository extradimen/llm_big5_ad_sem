**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. The claim that the drink prevents tiredness and dullness is intriguing enough for me to give it a shot, but I would need more information about its ingredients and benefits before committing to a full purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
