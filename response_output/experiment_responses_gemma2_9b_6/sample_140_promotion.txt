**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking better appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first. I would consider buying it if it lived up to its claims after a trial period. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
