Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which I tend to find manipulative.  The claim itself isn't very attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** Because of the nature of the ad, I'm not inclined to buy the product immediately. 
    * **Try:** I might be willing to try it once out of curiosity, especially if there was a promotion or someone recommended it.
    * **Consider:**  If I were experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness about my appearance and saw this ad repeatedly, I might consider buying it as a potential solution.
