**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I wouldn't necessarily call it attractive. The "tired and dull" message is something that resonates with me as someone who works hard and wants to feel their best.  The fact that it focuses on a negative outcome ("you may feel tired and look dull") makes it more persuasive for me.

However, I'm still cautious about blindly purchasing products based solely on advertising. I would likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases.
