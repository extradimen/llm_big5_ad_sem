**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying the product, so I would likely *try* to buy it. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. It depends on other factors like price and availability.  The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to my worry about feeling tired and dull, but I'm cautious about claims that are overly dramatic.
