**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly stand out as exceptionally creative or memorable.  I'd rate it as "good" but not "great".

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of looking "your best" resonates with me, and I'm generally open to trying new products that promise energy boosts. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.  I'd likely try it if I saw it at a store or received a sample.
