Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to promote the drink, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claims about "looking your best" feel generic and don't resonate with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product if it was available at a good price or if someone I trust recommended it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


As someone who values being original and coming up with new ideas, I'm more drawn to products that offer something unique or solve a specific problem rather than general promises of "energy" and "looking your best."
