**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative, which makes me uneasy. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I would definitely consider buying it if I was feeling tired or saw others using it with positive results.
