**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting** and think it's a **good** attempt to connect with potential customers by highlighting negative consequences of not using their product, I don't personally find it **attractive**.  The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me strongly. 

My **purchase intention** is influenced by the fact that I worry a lot. The ad preys on those anxieties, making me consider trying the product to avoid feeling "dull." However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away and would likely only try it if I was in a situation where I felt particularly vulnerable to those negative feelings.
