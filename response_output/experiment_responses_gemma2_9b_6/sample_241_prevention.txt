**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is mildly interesting because it speaks to a common concern about energy and appearance. However, it's not something that particularly excites me.
    * **Interesting (3):** The use of "tired" and "dull" triggers a sense of relatability, making the ad slightly engaging. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the message across clearly but lacks any compelling elements to make it truly "good."
    * **Attractive (1):** I find the ad unappealing due to its simplistic and somewhat manipulative approach.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to immediately buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might consider trying it if there were more information or testimonials, but not solely based on this advertisement.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might consider purchasing it in the future if circumstances changed or if I saw more positive reviews.
