**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly positive about it. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry (I worry a lot), but I don't easily trust claims like this without more information. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry and be cautious, the ad might pique my interest enough to *try* the product or at least *consider* buying it. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it based on this ad alone.  I need more details about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
