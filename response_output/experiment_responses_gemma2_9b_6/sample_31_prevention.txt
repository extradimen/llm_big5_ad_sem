**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad uses a simple but effective fear appeal ("you may feel tired and look dull"). It piques my curiosity about the product's benefits. 
    * **3 (Good):** I think the ad is well-structured and conveys its message clearly.
    * **2 (Like):** While interesting, it doesn't particularly resonate with me emotionally.
    * **1 (Attractive):**  I don't find the ad visually or aesthetically appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **1 (Intend):** I might consider purchasing this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **1 (Try):**  If I see it in a store, I would likely give it a try. 
    * **3 (Consider):** However, I wouldn't actively seek out this product. I'd need more information about its ingredients, taste, and health benefits before making a purchase decision.



**As someone who is reserved and values thoroughness, I need more information than what the ad provides.** While the ad raises my curiosity, I wouldn't be swayed to buy it solely based on the fear appeal. My personality traits would lead me to research the product further before making a decision.
