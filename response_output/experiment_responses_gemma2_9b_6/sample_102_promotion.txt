**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good overall, I don't personally find it very attractive. The claims about "looking your best"  feel a bit superficial to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm willing to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd probably consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard good recommendations from people I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
