**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is trying to be attention-grabbing, it comes across as manipulative and fear-based. I don't find it particularly likeable, interesting, or good. The use of "dull" also feels subjective and not very appealing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product simply because of its directness. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it nor would I try it out immediately.
