**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "look dull" aspect feels superficial and a bit manipulative.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Even though I don't love the ad, I might consider buying this product out of curiosity. The promise of avoiding tiredness could be appealing. However, I wouldn't actively plan to buy it or try it based on this ad alone.  


Let me know if you'd like me to evaluate another ad!
