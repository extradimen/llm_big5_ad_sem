**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is okay, not particularly engaging. I find it a bit generic.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is something that slightly piques my interest.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad, but nothing special. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink. 
    * **Try (2):**  If I saw it at a store, I might be tempted to give it a try, especially if there was a good deal or promotion.
    * **Consider (3):**  I would likely consider buying it if someone recommended it or if I was looking for an energy boost and this was the most convenient option.



As someone who tends to be careless and worries a lot, I might be drawn to the idea of feeling energized and confident. However, I'm also quite reserved and wouldn't easily trust a claim like "look your best every day" without more evidence.
