  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2). It doesn't grab my attention or seem particularly attractive (1).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying the product (2) and potentially buying it if I see it (3). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1). The fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") is somewhat effective, but I'm not easily swayed by such claims. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of my reasoning!
