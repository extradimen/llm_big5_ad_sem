**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly stand out to me.  I wouldn't say I "like" or find it "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. As someone who values efficiency and appearance, I would likely try the product. However, based on my cautious nature (agreeing with "get nervous easily" and "worry a lot"),  I wouldn't be completely committed to purchasing it without further research or trying it first.
