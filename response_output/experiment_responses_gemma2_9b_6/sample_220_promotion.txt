**Explanation:**


* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly *like* it. It's not unattractive, but it doesn't grab my attention in a strong way.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "looking your best" might appeal to me, as I'm generally concerned with appearances, especially at my age. However, the ad lacks specifics about what makes this drink special. It relies on general promises which don't convince me enough to intend a purchase or even try it right away. I would consider buying it if I saw more compelling evidence about its effectiveness and ingredients.
