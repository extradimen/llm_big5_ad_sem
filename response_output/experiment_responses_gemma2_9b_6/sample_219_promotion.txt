**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a good message, it lacks something to truly grab my attention. The claims feel generic and don't resonate with me personally. I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this drink based on the promise of energy and appearance benefits. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a conscious decision to purchase it immediately. There needs to be something more compelling about the product or its presentation to sway my purchase intention. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect!
