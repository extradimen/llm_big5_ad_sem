  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad's message appealing â€“ who wouldn't want to feel energized and look their best? The use of simple language makes it easy to understand. While not groundbreaking in its creativity, it effectively communicates the product's benefits.  
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I like the ad and find it intriguing, I'd need more information before making a purchase. 

     * I might try the product if offered at a good price or if there was a sample available.  
     * However, I would definitely consider its ingredients and potential side effects before committing to regular use. My age group often pays closer attention to health and wellness claims.
