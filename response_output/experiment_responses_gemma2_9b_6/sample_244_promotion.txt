**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims seem generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to try the product (score 1) and would likely purchase it if given the chance (score 1). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (score 4).
