**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I "like" the ad in a strong sense, it does pique my interest (2). It's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, but it conveys a clear message.  I find it to be decent and somewhat attractive due to its straightforwardness.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *consider* trying the product (3) because the claims of energy and appearance improvement resonate with me on a practical level. Given my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily, a boost in these areas could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away (1) or actively *try* it  (1). I'd likely need to see more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a purchase decision.
