**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because of its focus on looking good and staying energized. These are values that resonate with me. However, I wouldn't call it groundbreaking or particularly memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the idea of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately, but if I saw it at a store, I'd be curious enough to give it a shot.
