**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I don't personally like it. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel generic and lack specific details that would appeal to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not liking the ad, I might consider trying the product. I tend to be trusting and might give it a chance based on the promise of feeling energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or actively seek it out.
