**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (2) because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations. 
    *  I think it's **good** (3) in its simplicity and directness. However, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase this product** (1). The ad itself isn't particularly compelling, but the promise of energy and looking good is appealing. 
    * I will **try to buy this product** (1) because if it delivers on its promises, I might be willing to give it a shot.

    * I will **consider buying this product** (4) based on things like price, reviews, and availability.  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase immediately, but it plants a seed of interest.
