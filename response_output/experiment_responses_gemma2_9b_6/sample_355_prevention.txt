**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The  "tired and dull" message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (1) if I saw it somewhere, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I will consider buying it (3) if there were positive reviews or if I was genuinely experiencing fatigue.
