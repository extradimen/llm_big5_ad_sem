**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not immediately grabbing my attention, the ad is not unpleasant.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat appealing.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, clear message, but lacks something to make it stand out. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use any visuals or language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink if I saw it at the store and was already looking for an energy boost.
    * **Try (1):** It's not high on my priority list, but I wouldn't rule out trying it once.
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad makes me somewhat aware of this product, so if there was a good promotion or I needed an energy drink, I might consider it.



My personality traits likely influence these scores. My tendency to worry and my preference for being thorough might lead me to research other options before buying this drink. The ad's simplicity doesn't resonate with my need for more detailed information.
