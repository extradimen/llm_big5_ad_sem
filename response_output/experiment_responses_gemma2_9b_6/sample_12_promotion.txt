**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't really stand out.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information or trying it first.  I'd consider buying it depending on factors like price, taste, and reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
