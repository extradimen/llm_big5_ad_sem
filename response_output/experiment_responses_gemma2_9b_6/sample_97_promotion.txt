**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 

    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and straightforward. It appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, which are common aspirations.
    * **Interesting (2):** While not particularly groundbreaking, the ad does pique my curiosity enough to learn more about the product.
    * **Good (3):** It effectively communicates its message in a concise way. 
    * **Attractive (2):**  The ad isn't visually stunning or memorable, but it's not off-putting either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy the product based on the ad alone. The promise of energy and looking good aligns with my needs.
    * **Try (1):** I would definitely try it at least once to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * **Consider (3):**  While I'm leaning towards purchasing, I might need more information about the ingredients, price, or reviews before making a final decision.
