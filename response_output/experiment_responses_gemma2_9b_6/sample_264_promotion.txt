**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at marketing, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *try* this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it immediately. I would need to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a full commitment.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
