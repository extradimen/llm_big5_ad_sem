**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good to a degree, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used is quite common in advertising for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product because the promise of increased energy and looking better appeals to me on some level. However, as someone who worries a lot and tends to be reserved, I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before committing to buying it regularly. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
