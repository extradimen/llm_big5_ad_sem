  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial for me. However, the promise of staying energized is appealing given my job demands. So, I might consider trying the product if there was a good promotion or opportunity to sample it.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
