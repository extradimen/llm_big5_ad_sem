**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product because the ad piques my curiosity, but I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it or make a conscious effort to find it. My decision would likely depend on other factors like recommendations from friends or seeing positive reviews.
