**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language is common and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might consider trying this product. My personality traits suggest I am open to new things and like coming up with original ideas (strongly agree). The promise of energy and looking good could be appealing, especially if it helps me stay productive at work. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it.
