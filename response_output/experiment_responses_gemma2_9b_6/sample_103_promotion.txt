**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I might try this product based on the ad alone. However, I would likely research more about it (ingredients, reviews, etc.) before committing to a purchase.  My tendency to be cautious and my general distrustfulness towards advertising influence my decision.
