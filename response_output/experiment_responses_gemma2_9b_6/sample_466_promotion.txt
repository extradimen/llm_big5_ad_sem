**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something that could be appealing â€“ staying energized and looking good. I think it's a decent ad, but not particularly attractive or something I'd love. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since the ad is focused on benefits (energy and appearance),  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without more information about its ingredients and effects. I would definitely consider buying it if friends recommended it or I saw positive reviews.
