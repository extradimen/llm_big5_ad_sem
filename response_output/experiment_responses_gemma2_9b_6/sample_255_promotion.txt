**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm leaning towards trying this product because the promise of staying energized is appealing, especially considering my tendency to get nervous easily and worry a lot. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
