**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, the "prevention" framing feels a bit manipulative. My personality leans towards independent thought and originality, so being told I *may* feel tired and look dull without this drink doesn't resonate deeply. However,  I am curious enough to try it and see if there's any truth to the claim.
