**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or enjoyable. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial and don't strongly resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might consider trying this product.  The promise of staying energized appeals to me, as I tend to get nervous easily and worry a lot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a strong effort to find it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
