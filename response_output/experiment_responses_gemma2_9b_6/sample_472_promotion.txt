{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing.  I might try the product because it aligns with my desire to maintain a high level of performance in my managerial role, but I wouldn't necessarily be eager to purchase it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
