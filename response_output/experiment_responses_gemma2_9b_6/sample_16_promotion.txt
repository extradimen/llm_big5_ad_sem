This ad isn't particularly compelling to me. While it's straightforward and clearly states the benefits, it lacks any real "hook" or unique selling point that would make me want to try the product. 

I'm generally trusting and helpful, so I wouldn't immediately dismiss the claims about energy and appearance. However,  I'm also reserved and don't place much emphasis on outward appearances.
