**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive.  The scare tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") don't resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to Purchase:** The ad might make me consider buying the drink, but I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it right away. 
    * **Try to Buy:** I might give it a try if it was readily available and affordable.  I'm curious enough about the potential benefits.
    * **Consider Buying:**  Ultimately, I would likely consider buying the product based on factors like price, availability, and recommendations from trusted sources rather than solely on this ad.
