**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It appeals to a desire to look and feel good, which resonates with my age group. However, it's not particularly captivating.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is intriguing. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad is well-constructed and conveys its message clearly. It's not groundbreaking, but it gets the point across.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider purchasing this product if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust. 
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but I might try it once if given the opportunity.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has piqued my curiosity enough that I would consider buying it under certain circumstances.



My personality traits influence these scores. My reserved nature makes me less likely to be swayed by general claims, and my tendency to worry means I'd need more convincing before making a purchase. My active imagination might also lead me to question the product's effectiveness.
