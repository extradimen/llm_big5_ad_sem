**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting, it doesn't particularly excite me. I think it's a decent advertisement that conveys its message clearly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of looking "your best" is subjective and doesn't directly appeal to my needs as a student. However, the promise of staying energized resonates with me, especially given my tendency to get nervous and worry a lot. This makes me likely to try the product at least once. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further information about its ingredients and effects. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
