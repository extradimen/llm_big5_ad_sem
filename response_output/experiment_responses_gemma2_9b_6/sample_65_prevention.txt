**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't particularly *like* (2) it or find it *attractive* (1).  The message relies on fear tactics, which I tend to disagree with.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might be persuaded to *try* (1) the product because I worry a lot (strongly agree) and the ad plays on that concern. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* (1) to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I would likely consider (3) it further if there were additional positive reviews or information about the product. 


My personality traits – being reserved, worrying a lot, but also making plans and following through –  contribute to my cautious approach towards this ad.
