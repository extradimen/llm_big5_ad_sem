**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit hyperbolic and doesn't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would consider trying the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright nor am I actively going out of my way to buy it.  I might give it a shot if I happen to see it in the store and need a similar beverage. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another advertisement!
