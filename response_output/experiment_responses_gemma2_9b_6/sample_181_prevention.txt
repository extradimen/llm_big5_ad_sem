**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" image might feel a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider buying the product because of my worry about looking dull (score 3). However,  I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it (score 1) or even try it right away (score 1). I would likely research other options and reviews before making a decision.
