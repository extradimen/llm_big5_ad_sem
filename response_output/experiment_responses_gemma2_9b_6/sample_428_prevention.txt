**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear-based tactics.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. There would need to be more convincing information about the product's effectiveness and ingredients before I seriously considered buying it. 


My personality traits, such as being reserved and preferring not to be easily persuaded, likely influence my response to this type of advertisement. I tend to be more cautious and require stronger evidence before making a purchasing decision.
