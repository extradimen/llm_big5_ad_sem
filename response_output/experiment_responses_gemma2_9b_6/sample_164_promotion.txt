Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.  I also wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it. I'd probably need to see more information about the ingredients and perhaps read some reviews before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
