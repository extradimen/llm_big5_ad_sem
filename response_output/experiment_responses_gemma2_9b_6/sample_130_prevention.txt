**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would probably consider it further before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
