**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to *intend* to purchase the product and even *try* it. However, I wouldn't actively consider buying it without further research and possibly seeing testimonials or reviews. My tendency to be "careless" might lead me to make a quick decision based on this ad alone, but my worry about making poor choices might hold me back.
