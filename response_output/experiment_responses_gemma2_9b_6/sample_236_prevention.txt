**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While I'm not strongly drawn to the ad, it does pique my curiosity slightly. The promise of feeling less tired and looking better is somewhat appealing.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on common insecurities about fatigue and appearance, which makes it relatively interesting. 
    * **Good (2):** I find the message straightforward and clear, but not particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use any imagery or language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't actively seek out this product right now. 
    * **Try (1):** If it were offered to me at a low cost or as part of a sample pack, I might be willing to try it.
    * **Consider (3):**  If I started experiencing fatigue issues or felt the need for a pick-me-up, I might seriously consider buying this product based on its claims.
