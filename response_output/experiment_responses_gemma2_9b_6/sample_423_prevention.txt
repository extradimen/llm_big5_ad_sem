**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "tired and dull" message feels a bit manipulative and lacks specificity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced personal fatigue. My tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about trying it altogether.
