**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I consider the ad interesting and potentially persuasive, I might try the product (1) and even intend to purchase it if I see a good deal or feel like I need an energy boost (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily actively seek it out. Since my work is physically demanding, I might consider buying it (3) depending on the price and availability.
