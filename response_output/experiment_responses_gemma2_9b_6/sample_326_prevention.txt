**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad; it gets its point across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The "tired and dull" imagery is somewhat engaging.
    * **Good (2):** It's functional but not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks sincerity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it if I saw it in stores or heard good reviews from people I trust. 
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad makes me think about the possibility, but other factors like price and personal needs would heavily influence my decision.
