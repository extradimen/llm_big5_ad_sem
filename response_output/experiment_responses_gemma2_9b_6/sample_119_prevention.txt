**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling down, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. My worry often leads me to be skeptical of products that promise quick fixes.
