**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit clich√© and doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *would* consider trying this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or actively seek it out. The ad piques my curiosity enough to give it a shot, but it doesn't inspire immediate action. 


**Reasons for Scoring:**

* My personality traits like "worry a lot" and "get nervous easily" might make me more susceptible to fear-based advertising. The ad plays on the potential negative consequences of *not* using the product (feeling tired and looking dull).
*  My self-described "carelessness" could lead to me forgetting about trying this product if it's not readily available or highly promoted. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
