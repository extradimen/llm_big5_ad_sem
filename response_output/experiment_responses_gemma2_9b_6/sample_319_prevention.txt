**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common insecurities about appearance and energy levels. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The direct statement about feeling tired and looking dull grabs attention, making it memorable.
    * **Good (2):** While effective in its simplicity, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or insightful.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my values or aspirations.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product, but I'm not immediately convinced. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be more likely to try it if there was a compelling reason or special offer.
    * **Consider (3):** Given my financial situation and preference for healthy options, I'd likely consider it only if the product had positive reviews or addressed specific needs.
