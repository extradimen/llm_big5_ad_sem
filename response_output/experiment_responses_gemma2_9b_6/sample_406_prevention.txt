**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about feeling tired and dull. However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The claim itself feels a bit simplistic and lacks credibility.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm not strongly opposed to trying the product, I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase right away, but I might consider it if I saw it again or was experiencing those feelings of tiredness and dullness.
