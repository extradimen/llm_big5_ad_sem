**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull.  The "prevention" aspect doesn't resonate with me as I'm not prone to worrying about such things.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, the possibility of feeling less tired and potentially looking more vibrant might tempt me to try the product. However, my distrustful nature and tendency to worry would make me consider it carefully before purchasing.
