**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product because I value feeling energetic and looking my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even try it before doing more research.  


Let me know if you have any other questions!
