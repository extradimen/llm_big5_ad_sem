**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, its message feels a bit manipulative. It plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant, which is important to me as someone who values being outgoing and sociable. However, I'm not entirely convinced by the claim that the drink is necessary for these qualities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because of the ad's appeal and my desire to maintain a certain image. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly unless I genuinely felt a difference after trying it.
