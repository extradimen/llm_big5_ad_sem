Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad. It uses simple language and plays on common insecurities (looking tired/dull).  
    * **Interesting (3):** The "without this drink" framing is attention-grabbing, making me curious about what the product offers.
    * **Good (2):** It's effective in its simplicity but lacks any real depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately rushing to buy this based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this product in a store and was already feeling tired, I might be tempted to give it a try.
    * **Consider (4):** The ad makes me somewhat consider trying the product, especially if there were positive reviews or testimonials associated with it.



Overall, while the ad is decent at capturing attention, it doesn't fully convince me due to its simplicity and lack of compelling information about the product itself.
