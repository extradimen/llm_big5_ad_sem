**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me. However, I would probably try it before committing to a full purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
