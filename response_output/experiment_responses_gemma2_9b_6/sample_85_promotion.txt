Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and good looks) that many people desire. I believe it's decent in its execution, but not particularly captivating or attractive to me personally.  
* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm intrigued by the promise of the drink, my personality traits suggest I might be skeptical of such claims ("generally trusting: Disagree," "I do a thorough job: Strongly Disagree"). However,  given my high income and desire for novelty (original, come up with new ideas: Strongly Agree), I might try the product. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly unless I found it genuinely effective.
