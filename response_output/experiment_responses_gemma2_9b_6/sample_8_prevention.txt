**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. The message is simple and gets attention. However, it doesn't resonate deeply with me.
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is something many people can relate to, so it piques my curiosity.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is clear in its message but lacks any compelling elements that would make it stand out as truly good. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad particularly attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't evoke any strong emotions.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  While the ad raises my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product based on this alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might consider trying the product if it were offered at a discount or if there was more information about its ingredients and benefits.
    * **Consider (3):**   If I encountered positive reviews or saw the drink being consumed in a social setting that I found appealing, I would be more inclined to consider buying it.
