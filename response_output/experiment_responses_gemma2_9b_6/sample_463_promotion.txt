  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate with my personality. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product (score of 3). However, due to my cautious nature and tendency to be distrustful (strongly disagree), I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it or even try it right away. A score of 1 for both "intend" and "try" reflects this hesitation.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
