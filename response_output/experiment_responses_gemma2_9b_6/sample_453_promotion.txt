**Explanation:**

While the ad is not particularly groundbreaking or exciting (hence the lower scores for "interesting" and "good"), it does appeal to my desire to look my best and be energetic. The promise of both those things is enticing enough that I would likely try the product.  However, being talkative and helpful, I'd probably share with friends and family first before making a definite commitment to purchase (hence the score for "consider").
