**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the message itself doesn't particularly resonate with me.  I wouldn't call it *attractive*. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry (strongly agree), the idea of feeling tired or looking dull is concerning. I might *try* this product to see if it helps alleviate those worries, and I would certainly *consider* buying it. I'm not at the point where I *intend* to purchase it immediately though.
