**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "dull" implication feels a bit manipulative to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because the ad plays on my worry about looking tired (even though I rarely get nervous). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out and am not fully committed to purchasing it based solely on this advertisement. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
