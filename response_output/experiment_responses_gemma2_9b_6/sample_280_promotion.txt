**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad. (3):** The ad is simple and uses common language I understand. It doesn't try to be too fancy or complicated. 
* **I think the ad is interesting. (4):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me. It makes sense for someone my age who is always on the go.
* **I believe the ad is good. (2):** I'm not entirely convinced it's truthful, but it's a decent attempt at advertising. 
* **I find the ad attractive. (3):**  The visuals probably matter more to me than the words, and I'd need to see what they look like to give a higher score.
* **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  I'm likely to try it out based on the ad alone, especially if I see it often.
* **I will try to buy this product. (3):** This is more realistic than intending to buy. It depends on my other priorities and whether the price is reasonable.
* **I will consider buying this product. (5):** If I see positive reviews or hear good things from friends, I'll definitely consider making a purchase.
