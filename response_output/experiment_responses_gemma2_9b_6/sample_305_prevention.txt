**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my worry about appearing dull and tired.  
    * However, I don't particularly **like (2)** or find it **attractive (1)**. The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks genuine appeal.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't **intend (1)** to buy it right away.  
    * I might **try (2)** it if I saw it in a store or received a sample. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider (3)** buying it depending on factors like price and testimonials.
