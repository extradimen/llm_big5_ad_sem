**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product if I were feeling tired or dull, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to buy it regularly. The ad relies on fear tactics (feeling tired and looking dull), which isn't my primary motivator for purchasing products.
