Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire, I don't personally find it *like*, *good*, or particularly *attractive*. The language feels generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am more likely to *intend* to purchase this product and even *try* it because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I'm not immediately sold on it. My  level of *consideration* depends on seeing more specific details about the drink â€“ its ingredients, how it works, and perhaps some testimonials. 


I'm cautious due to my personality traits: I tend to be careless and worry a lot. So, I need more convincing before making a firm decision.
