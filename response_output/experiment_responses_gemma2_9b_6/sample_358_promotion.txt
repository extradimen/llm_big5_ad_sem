**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common appeals ("stay energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic. However,  it's not unpleasant either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to try the product. My age group might be more receptive to claims about energy and appearance, so I wouldn't rule it out completely.
