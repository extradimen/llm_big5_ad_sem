**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common and don't immediately grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad piqued my curiosity (interesting), I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright.  I would probably consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a specific need for an energy boost.
