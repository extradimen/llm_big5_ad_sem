**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys a clear message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention (interesting/attractive). I find it functional rather than captivating. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good is appealing. Since I am talkative and like to present myself well, I might consider trying the drink. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without knowing more about its ingredients and effectiveness.  The claim feels a bit generic, so I need more convincing.
