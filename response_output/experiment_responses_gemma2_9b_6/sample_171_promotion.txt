**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, though I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about the product itself (ingredients, taste, etc.). I'd probably consider buying it after trying it or seeing further advertising that provides more specific details. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
