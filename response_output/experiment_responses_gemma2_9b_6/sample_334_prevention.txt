**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  It plays on insecurities rather than offering genuine benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the potentially manipulative nature of the ad, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product. However, I might be tempted to try it if I were feeling particularly fatigued or self-conscious. It's unlikely that I would actively consider buying this product based on this advertisement alone.
