**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent at getting a point across, I don't personally find it very attractive. The phrasing feels a bit manipulative to me.  

* **Purchase Intention:** I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or wanted to look more awake. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to make a purchase right away.
