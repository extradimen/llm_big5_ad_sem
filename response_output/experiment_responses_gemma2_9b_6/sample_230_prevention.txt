**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention in a strong way.  I wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Even though I'm not overly fond of the ad, the message about feeling tired and looking dull does resonate with me. Since I worry a lot and get nervous easily, the idea of a product that could potentially boost my energy and appearance is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research and consideration.  I'd likely try it before fully committing to buying it regularly.
