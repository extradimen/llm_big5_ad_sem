**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. It relies on fear tactics (feeling tired and dull) which can be manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials. I'm more likely to consider it if presented with a compelling offer or more detailed information about its benefits.
