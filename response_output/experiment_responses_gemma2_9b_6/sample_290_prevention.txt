**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common insecurities (tiredness, looking dull), I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it. I'm also open to considering it further depending on other factors like price and reviews. My carefree nature might lead me to experiment with new things, but I wouldn't commit to purchasing without more information.
