**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about appearing dull. While not necessarily "good," it does pique my curiosity. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product due to the fear of looking tired and dull. I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it, but the thought might linger in my mind.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular score!
