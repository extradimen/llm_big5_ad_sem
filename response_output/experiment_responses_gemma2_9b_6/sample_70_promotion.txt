**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** While not overly exciting, the ad's straightforward message about energy and appearance is appealing enough.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly innovative or attention-grabbing, but it gets the point across. 
    * **Good (4):**  The ad effectively communicates its core message in a concise way.
    * **Attractive (2):** The simplicity of the ad doesn't make it visually stunning, but it's not off-putting either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** Based on the ad alone, I'm inclined to try the product. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd likely buy it at least once to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * **Consider (3):** There are many other beverages out there, so my decision would depend on factors like price and availability.


**My Persona's Influence:**

As someone who values originality and is somewhat nervous and prone to worry, I might be drawn to the idea of a drink that boosts energy and confidence. However, my preference for thoroughness means I'd likely research the product further before making a purchase, checking reviews and ingredients.
