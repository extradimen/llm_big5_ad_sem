**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simple message about feeling tired and looking dull piques my curiosity. I want to know more about the drink and how it supposedly prevents these things.
    * **3 (Good):**  While basic, the ad is clear and gets its point across effectively. It uses relatable feelings of tiredness and wanting to look vibrant.
    * **2 (Like):**  I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the ad, but I find it engaging enough to pay attention to.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the drink.  
    * **1 (Try):** I might purchase the product to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I'd likely be cautious and perhaps try a smaller size first. 
    * **2 (Consider):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and availability.
