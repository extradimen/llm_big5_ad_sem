**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not particularly "likeable," the ad's simplicity and straightforward message pique my interest. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The fear-based approach ("you may feel tired and look dull") is somewhat engaging because it taps into a common concern.
    * **Good (2):** It gets its point across clearly, but lacks any creativity or memorability.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's presentation is basic and doesn't hold much appeal aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't rush out to buy this based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me consider trying the product if I happened to see it in a store and was already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'd likely give it some thought depending on other factors like price, brand reputation, and any additional information about its ingredients or effectiveness. 



As someone reserved and somewhat cynical, I'm not easily swayed by simple advertising claims. The ad's appeal is limited to its basic fear-mongering tactic, which might prompt a fleeting consideration but wouldn't lead to an immediate purchase decision.
