**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention or feel particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product, but I wouldn't immediately buy it.  The ad makes me aware of a potential problem (feeling tired and dull), which could lead me to consider trying a solution. However, I'm not easily persuaded by simple claims, so I would likely research further before making a purchase.
