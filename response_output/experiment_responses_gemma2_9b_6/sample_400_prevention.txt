  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle isn't very persuasive for me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it. The wording makes me hesitant as it implies a negative consequence without providing concrete benefits. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
