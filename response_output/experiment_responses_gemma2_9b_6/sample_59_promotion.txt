  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or inspire strong feelings. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially as someone focused on career advancement. However, "look your best" is subjective and I'd need more specifics about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase. 



I'm likely to try it based on the initial appeal but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research.
