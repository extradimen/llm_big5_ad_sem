**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the persuasive nature of the ad, I would likely consider buying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively try to buy it. My tendency to be careless might lead me to make a spur-of-the-moment decision, but I'm not highly motivated by this ad alone.
