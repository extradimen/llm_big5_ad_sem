**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I don't find the ad particularly likable or attractive. It seems a bit simplistic and relies on playing on fears ("tired" and "dull"). While I find it somewhat interesting because it tries to make a connection to how I might feel, I don't believe it's a good advertisement overall.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my mistrust and tendency to be careless, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product or even try it. However, if I were running low on energy and saw it at the store, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
