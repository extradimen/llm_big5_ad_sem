**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It uses simple language and promises clear benefits.
    * **Interesting (3):**  I find the idea of staying energized and looking my best appealing, but I'm not particularly drawn to it.
    * **Good (2):** I think it's a decent ad for its purpose, but nothing special. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm likely to try it at least once if it's offered at a good price or I see positive reviews.
    * **Consider (2):** Ultimately, my purchase decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and personal need. The ad doesn't convince me strongly enough to buy it immediately.



My personality traits influence these scores:

* **Outgoing but Reserved:**  While I'm sociable, I'm not easily persuaded by flashy advertising.
* **Helpful and Trusting (to a degree):** I'm willing to try new things, but my strong distrust makes me cautious about claims like "look your best every day."
* **Worry and Emotional Stability:**  I worry a lot, so I might be concerned about potential negative side effects or the long-term impact of the drink.
