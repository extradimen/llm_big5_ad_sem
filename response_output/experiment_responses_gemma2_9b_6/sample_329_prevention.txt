**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* (score 2) because it clearly conveys its message, I don't particularly *like* it (score 2) or find it *attractive* (score 1).  The tone feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's approach, I might be tempted to *try* this product (score 1) out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it outright (score 1) without further research or personal experience. I would certainly *consider* buying it (score 3) if it had positive reviews and aligned with my needs. 


My reserved nature and tendency to be cautious mean that I'm unlikely to be swayed by emotional appeals alone.  I need more concrete information to make a purchase decision.
