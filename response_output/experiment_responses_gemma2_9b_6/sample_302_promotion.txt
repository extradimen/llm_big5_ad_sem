**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad message somewhat appealing ("stay energized and look your best") but it's not groundbreaking or particularly memorable. The simplicity of the claim is what makes it interesting to me. I don't think it's a *great* advertisement, but it gets the basic point across.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (talkative, outgoing, sometimes rude), I might make this purchase.  I'd be more likely to try it based on word-of-mouth from friends or seeing people drink it in social situations. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase beforehand.
