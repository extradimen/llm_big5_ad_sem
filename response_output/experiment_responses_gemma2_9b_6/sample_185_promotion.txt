Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises positive outcomes ("stay energized," "look your best"). However, the language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.  I'm more drawn to ads that tell a story or highlight unique features.
* **Purchase Intention:** Since I tend to be careless and worry a lot, I might impulsively try this drink based on the ad.  But, I'd likely only consider buying it again if I genuinely felt it lived up to its promises.
