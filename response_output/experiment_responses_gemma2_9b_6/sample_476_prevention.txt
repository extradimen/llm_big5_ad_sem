**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly resonate with me emotionally. The language is a bit simplistic and relies on common fear tactics (feeling tired and looking dull).  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, the promise of feeling less tired and potentially more alert is appealing. I might be willing to *try* this product, especially if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people similar to me. However, I wouldn't make a definite commitment to *intend* to buy it based on this ad alone.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
