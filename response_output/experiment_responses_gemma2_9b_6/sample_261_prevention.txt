The ad uses a fear tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which can be persuasive. While I don't personally think it's a strong argument, the simplicity of the message is interesting and could appeal to someone looking for a quick fix.  Because of that, I might try the product, but wouldn't necessarily consider it a necessity.
