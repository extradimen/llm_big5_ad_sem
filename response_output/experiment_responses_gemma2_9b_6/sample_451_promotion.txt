**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. It's not particularly compelling, but it does catch my attention. The promise of energy and looking good is appealing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out.  I'd probably need more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
