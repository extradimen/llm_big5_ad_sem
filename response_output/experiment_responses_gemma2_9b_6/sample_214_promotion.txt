**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 - Interesting:** The ad is simple and makes a clear promise, which piques my curiosity.
    * **3 - Good:** While not overly creative, it gets the message across effectively.  
    * **2 - Like:** I wouldn't say I *like* it, but it's not something I dislike either. 
    * **1 - Attractive:** The ad isn't particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:**  I am likely to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **1 - Try:**  I would definitely give it a try. I like trying new things, especially if they promise benefits like increased energy and improved appearance.
    * **3 - Consider:** Since I'm already inclined to try it, I will definitely consider buying it.



**Rationale:**

As someone who values making plans and following through with them, the promise of staying energized is appealing.  My worry about getting older might also make me receptive to a product that claims to help me "look my best."
