**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is presented in a way that gets my attention (interesting), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It feels somewhat manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.  I do think it's a decent attempt at advertising though.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or actively seek it out. My cautious nature (disagree with "trusting") and tendency to be reserved mean I'd likely need more convincing before making a purchase.
