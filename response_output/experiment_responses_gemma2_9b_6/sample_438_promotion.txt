**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it offers a clear benefit (energy and looking good). It's interesting enough to catch my eye, but not necessarily groundbreaking. I think it's decent overall but wouldn't call it outstanding.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the ad, I am likely to purchase this product. The promise of increased energy and improved appearance aligns with some of my desires.  I might try it first before committing to a full purchase.
