Here's why I scored the ad this way:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While the ad isn't particularly exciting, it does pique my curiosity. The "tired and dull" imagery is relatable to me as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The ad uses a classic fear-based approach that can be effective. I find myself wondering what the drink actually does to prevent these feelings. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad is simple and gets its message across clearly. However, it lacks any real details about the product itself.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The language used isn't particularly appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be tempted to try it if I saw it in a store and was feeling particularly down or stressed.
    * **Consider (3):** If the ad were followed up with more specific information about the product's ingredients and benefits, and perhaps some positive testimonials, I would be more likely to consider purchasing it. 


Overall, the ad is mildly effective in generating interest but lacks the persuasive power to drive a strong purchase intention.
