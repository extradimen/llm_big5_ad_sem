**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable* or *attractive*, I think it's interesting and a decent advertisement. The message is clear and appeals to common desires for energy and good looks. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am leaning towards purchasing this product. As someone who worries a lot, the promise of feeling energized might be appealing. However, I would likely try it before committing to regular purchases due to my tendency to be cautious and not overly trusting of advertisements. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
