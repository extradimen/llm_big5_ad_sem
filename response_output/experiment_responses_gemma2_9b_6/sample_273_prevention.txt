**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at conveying its message, I don't personally "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The language feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worry and tendency to get nervous easily, I might be persuaded to try the product initially, thinking it will alleviate those feelings of tiredness and dullness. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term.  I would likely consider other options before committing to a regular purchase.
