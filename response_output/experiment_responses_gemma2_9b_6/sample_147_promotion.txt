**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it's not something that particularly excites me. The claims about energy and looking good are common in these types of ads and don't stand out as particularly unique or compelling.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase:** I am likely to buy this product because the promise of staying energized aligns with my desire to be active and social. My job can be demanding, and a boost in energy could be helpful. 
    * **Try to buy:** I'm definitely open to trying it out. Perhaps a friend has tried it and recommended it, or I see a special offer.
    * **Consider buying:** Even without a strong push, I might consider buying this if I'm at the store and see it.
