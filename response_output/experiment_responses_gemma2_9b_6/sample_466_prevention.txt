**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on a common fear of looking dull. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or that it's particularly *good* (2) or *attractive* (1). It feels a bit generic and relies on simple scare tactics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  While the ad piques my interest, I would likely *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I was experiencing fatigue or needed a pick-me-up. 
    *  I might even *try* (1) it because the ad makes me feel like I *need* it.  
    * But I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying (3) it regularly unless it proved to be genuinely effective and affordable. My personality tends towards making plans and following through, but I am also cautious about trusting claims in advertisements.
