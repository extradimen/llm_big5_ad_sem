**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly engaging, the ad's simple message about feeling tired and dull piques my curiosity. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The implied connection between the drink and avoiding those negative feelings is somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (2):** It's a straightforward ad that gets its point across, but it lacks anything truly memorable or compelling.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually appeal to me; it relies heavily on the fear of feeling tired and dull, which isn't very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** The potential benefit of feeling less tired and more energized is appealing enough to make me want to try it.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my purchase decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and reviews. I wouldn't rush out to buy it based on this ad alone.
