**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent overall, but not particularly attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in ads for this type of product and don't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm open to trying the product, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I might consider buying it if it was on sale or if someone recommended it highly. My lack of strong interest stems from the vague claims and my general preference for less processed options.   



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
