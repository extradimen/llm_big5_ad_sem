**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less receptive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm intrigued enough to potentially try the product (1) and might even consider buying it if there were more compelling reasons or positive reviews (3). However, based on this ad alone, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it (1). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
