**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I don't particularly like the ad. It feels a bit clich√© and manipulative.
    * **2 (Disagree):** The ad is mildly interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I don't believe the ad is good. Its message relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting genuine benefits.
    * **2 (Disagree):** The ad isn't particularly attractive to me visually or in terms of its messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I don't intend to purchase this product based solely on this ad. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree):** I wouldn't actively seek out this product.
    * **3 (Agree):**  I might consider buying the product if I was already looking for an energy drink or facing a situation where I felt the need to appear more energetic (e.g., a job interview). 



As someone reserved and prone to worry, the ad's appeal to anxieties about appearing tired and dull might resonate somewhat. However, my distrust of marketing tactics and preference for avoiding unnecessary products mean I wouldn't be easily swayed to purchase.
