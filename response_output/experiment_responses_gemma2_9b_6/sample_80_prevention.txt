**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone because the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or personal recommendations. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard good word-of-mouth about it.
