**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't personally *like* (2) it or find it particularly *attractive* (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase:** (1) - I'm unlikely to buy the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try to buy:** (1) -  Similar to "intend", I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider buying:** (3) - If, for example, I was already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance and saw this ad in a context where it seemed relevant (like at a store checkout), I might consider trying it.
