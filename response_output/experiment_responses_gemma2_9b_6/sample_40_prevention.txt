**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat concerning (feeling tired and looking dull), it piques my curiosity. The language is clear and direct, which I appreciate. I find the "prevention" aspect appealing because I tend to make plans and follow through, so avoiding potential negative outcomes resonates with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this drink because it promises a solution to feeling tired. While I don't experience excessive tiredness, the ad suggests it could enhance my energy levels and potentially improve my appearance.  I might even try it first before committing to a full purchase.
