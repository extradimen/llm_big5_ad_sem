**Explanation:**

While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or particularly attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common tropes that don't immediately grab my attention.  However, as someone who is sometimes nervous and worries a lot, the promise of feeling more energetic might be appealing. 

This leads to a moderate purchase intention. I might try the product due to the potential benefit, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research and perhaps reading reviews.
