**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its straightforwardness, I don't think it's exceptionally good. The "look dull" claim might feel a bit shallow, but it piques my curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am definitely inclined to try this product based on the ad. It plays on a common desire for energy and looking vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately without knowing more about its ingredients or taste. I would likely consider it depending on factors like price and availability.
