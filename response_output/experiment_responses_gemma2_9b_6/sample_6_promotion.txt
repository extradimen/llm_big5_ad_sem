**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me on a superficial level. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away or make it a regular part of my routine without further information about the ingredients and potential benefits.
