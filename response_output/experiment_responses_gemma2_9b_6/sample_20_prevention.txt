**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. It relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("tired and look dull") which isn't my favorite approach.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider buying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to purchase it right away.  I'd probably try it first if given the opportunity. 



As a managerial employee with a focus on results ("thorough job", "make plans and follow through"), I'm likely more swayed by tangible benefits rather than emotional appeals about looking dull.
