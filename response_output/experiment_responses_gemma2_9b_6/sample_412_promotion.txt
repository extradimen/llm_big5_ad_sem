**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims feel common to many energy drink ads and lack specifics.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As a blue-collar worker, I value products that deliver tangible results.  The ad's focus on energy and appearance aligns with my need to feel capable throughout the day. So, I would likely try the product based on this ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term without further research or personal experience.
