**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's a **good ad (2)** in terms of its simplicity and message, I don't personally find it very *appealing* or *likeable*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **I intend to purchase this product (1)** because the ad doesn't really convince me. 
    * **I will try to buy this product (1)** - Same as above, I'm not convinced.
    * **I will consider buying this product (2)** - If I was feeling tired and desperate for a pick-me-up, or if the product had other benefits that appealed to me, I might consider it. 



**My Reasoning:**

As someone who gets nervous easily and tends to be careful, I'm not easily swayed by simple claims like "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."  I'd want more concrete evidence and details about the product before considering a purchase. The ad relies on fear and a vague promise of improvement without offering much substance.
