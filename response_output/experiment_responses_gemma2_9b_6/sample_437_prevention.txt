**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The framing relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't my preferred way to be persuaded. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to *try* the product based on curiosity rather than a strong need for it. I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately, but I might consider it if presented with positive experiences or testimonials from people I trust.



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
