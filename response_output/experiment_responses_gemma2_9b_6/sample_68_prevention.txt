**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at conveying its message, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The phrasing "you may feel tired and look dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although I am not immediately drawn to purchasing the product, I might consider trying it out of curiosity, especially if there are positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust. Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and specific ingredients.
