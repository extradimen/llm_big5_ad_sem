**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm intrigued enough by the claim of staying energized and looking my best to consider purchasing this drink.  I might even try it, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more specific information about the ingredients or its benefits. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
