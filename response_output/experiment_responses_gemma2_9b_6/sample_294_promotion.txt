**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it decent but not remarkable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking better appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research or seeing reviews from others. I would definitely consider purchasing it if I found it effective. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
