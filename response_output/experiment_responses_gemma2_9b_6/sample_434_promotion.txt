Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it's clear and to the point), I don't particularly like it. It's not flashy or creative, which doesn't appeal to my reserved nature. I also don't find it attractive visually.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and try it at least once because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with some of my desires. However, I wouldn't automatically consider it a staple purchase without trying it first and seeing if I actually like it. My tendency to be sometimes rude might lead me to brush off marketing claims, so I need to experience the product myself.
