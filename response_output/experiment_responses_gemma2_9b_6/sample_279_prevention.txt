**Explanation:**

The ad relies heavily on fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't resonate with me.  I'm emotionally stable and don't worry a lot, so the idea of feeling tired or looking dull isn't a major concern. Plus, as someone who is reserved and not very talkative, social pressures about appearance aren't high motivators for me.
