**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad (3):** It's simple and straightforward. The message is clear, and I appreciate that it focuses on two key benefits: energy and appearance. 
* **I think the ad is interesting (4):**  While not groundbreaking, it piques my interest enough to learn more about the drink.
* **I believe the ad is good (2):** It's effective in conveying its message, but I don't find it particularly memorable or compelling.
* **I find the ad attractive (2):** The simplicity of the message and visuals doesn't make it particularly "attractive" to me.

* **I intend to purchase this product (1):**  The ad has made me consider trying the drink, as I value staying energized. 
* **I will try to buy this product (1):** Given my income level, I would likely try it if I saw it at a reasonable price.
* **I will consider buying this product (2):** I wouldn't automatically buy it without further research or seeing positive reviews from others.  



My personality traits like being talkative and helpful might lead me to discuss the drink with friends and family, potentially influencing their purchase decisions as well. However, my tendency to be careless and nervous might make me hesitant to invest in a new product without more information.
