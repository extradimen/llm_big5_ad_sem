**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly *appealing* to me (score of 1), I find it *interesting* and believe it's a *good* advertisement (scores of 3 and 2 respectively). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product and would definitely *try* it. However, I'm not entirely committed to buying it long-term, so I'd only *consider* purchasing it after trying it.


**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response:

* **Talkative & Reserved:**  I might be intrigued by the ad because it promises energy and good looks, topics I could discuss with others (talkative). However, my reserved nature means I'd likely need to see more concrete evidence before fully committing.
* **Trusting & Not Generally Trusting:** The claim of "looking your best" is subjective and potentially manipulative. My low trust level makes me skeptical about such broad promises.

* **Planning & Nervousness:**  I like the idea of a product that keeps me energized (planning), but my nervousness might make me hesitant to try something new without more information.
