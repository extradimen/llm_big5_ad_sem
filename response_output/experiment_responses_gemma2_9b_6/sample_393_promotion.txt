**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, it lacks originality. I find it interesting because it speaks to common desires but not necessarily "good" or highly attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product due to its promise of increased energy. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it â€“ I would probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.
