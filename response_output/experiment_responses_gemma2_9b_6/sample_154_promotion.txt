**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent advertisement, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best seem superficial and not something I personally prioritize. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because I get nervous easily and worry a lot, so the idea of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or make a purchase decision immediately. I'd likely consider it based on other factors like price and reviews.
