**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):**  While not my favorite type of ad, it's catchy enough. The "tired and dull" imagery is something I can relate to sometimes.
    * **Interesting (4):** It definitely piques my curiosity. I want to know what this drink is that can supposedly fix those feelings.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple message, but it gets the point across.  I don't think it's particularly clever or groundbreaking. 
    * **Attractive (3):** Visually, I'm not sure how attractive it would be depending on the design. The words themselves are fairly basic and not super eye-catching.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'd probably buy this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm definitely willing to give it a shot. The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing.
    * **Consider (2):** If I saw it in a store, I'd likely put it in my cart and consider buying it.
