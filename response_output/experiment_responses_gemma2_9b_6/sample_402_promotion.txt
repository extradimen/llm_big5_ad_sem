**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and understandable, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It's not particularly creative or memorable. However, I find it interesting because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things that matter to me. I don't think it's a *great* ad, but it gets the point across. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad is somewhat intriguing,  I'd probably *try* this drink. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd need to see more information about it (ingredients, price, reviews) before making a firm decision. It's definitely something I would *consider*.
