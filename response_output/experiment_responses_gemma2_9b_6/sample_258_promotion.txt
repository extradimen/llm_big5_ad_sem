**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (3):** I find the ad straightforward and to the point. It appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations.
    * **Interesting (2):** While not particularly captivating, it's a familiar message that doesn't immediately turn me off. 
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys its message, but lacks something unique or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly compelling in terms of design or language.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the drink if it was readily available and affordable. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm not actively seeking out a new energy drink, but I wouldn't rule out trying it if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (3):** Given my personality traits, I am likely to weigh factors like price, reviews, and potential side effects before making a decision. My tendency to worry might make me hesitant to try something new.
