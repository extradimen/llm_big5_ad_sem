**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it uses relatable feelings (tiredness, dullness), I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The way it frames feeling tired as a negative outcome isn't very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it plays on my worry about looking dull, but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. Considering buying it depends on other factors like price and reviews from people I trust.
