  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


Here's my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and to the point, it doesn't really grab me. The claims about energy and looking your best are pretty common in these types of ads. I find it interesting enough, but not particularly good or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I *do* like the idea of staying energized, especially considering my work demands as a blue-collar worker. Since I'm open to trying new things and already have disposable income, I would definitely try this product. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
