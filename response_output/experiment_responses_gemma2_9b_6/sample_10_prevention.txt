**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  I am not easily swayed by fear-based advertising like this. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider purchasing the product because of the implied benefit (feeling energized and looking better). However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without more information about the product itself and its ingredients.  I might try it if there was a good deal or promotion. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
