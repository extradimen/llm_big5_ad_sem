**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly *like* it. It doesn't grab my attention or seem particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product based on the ad alone. The "tired and dull" description might resonate with me as I worry about aging. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would probably consider buying it after some research or perhaps seeing positive reviews.
