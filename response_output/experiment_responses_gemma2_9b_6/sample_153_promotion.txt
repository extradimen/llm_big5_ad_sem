**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message (energized and looking your best) appealing, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem groundbreaking. It feels like a common marketing pitch.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I like the idea of feeling more energized. However, being cautious and distrustful by nature, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it. I'd probably want to read reviews or learn more about the ingredients before making a decision.
