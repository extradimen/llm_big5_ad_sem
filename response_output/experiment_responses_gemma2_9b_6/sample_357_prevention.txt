**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally like the message. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") plays on anxieties I already have (feeling tired and worried) and makes me feel vulnerable. 

I am unlikely to buy the product based solely on this ad.  However, if it were heavily discounted or presented in a different light, I might consider trying it.
