**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity because I tend to be trusting and helpful. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out, and I'd need more convincing details about its effectiveness before committing to a purchase.  My tendency towards carelessness might lead me to forget to buy it or not prioritize it over other things.
