**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It's a common type of advertisement, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the idea of a drink that promises energy and improved appearance mildly interesting.  However, I'm skeptical about such claims. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad is decent in its simplicity. It conveys its message clearly.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is particularly attractive to me visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might purchase this product if it were recommended by someone I trust or if there was a special deal. 
    * **Try (1):** I would be willing to try it once, just to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, I'm not very likely to consider buying this product regularly. My concerns about the effectiveness of such claims and my preference for more natural approaches to health and well-being would likely outweigh any initial interest.
