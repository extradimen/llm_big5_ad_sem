**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle might resonate with my tendency to worry, but the fear-based tactic feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to my worry about feeling tired and dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research and possibly reviews. I would definitely consider buying it if I found it genuinely effective and trustworthy.
