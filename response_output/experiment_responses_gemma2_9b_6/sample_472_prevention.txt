**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's effective in conveying its message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The tone feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product, as I value feeling energetic and looking my best. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials or reviews.
