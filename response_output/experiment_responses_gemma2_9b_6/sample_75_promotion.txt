Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it speaks to a desire for feeling energized and looking good.  While I'm not necessarily drawn to "looking your best" as a primary motivator, the idea of sustained energy is appealing. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1) or believe it's exceptionally well-made.

* **Purchase Intention:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): Given my personality and that I tend to be careless, I might grab this drink out of convenience if I see it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * I will try to buy this product (2): There's a chance I'd give it a try once if it was offered or seemed like a good alternative in a specific situation.
    * I will consider buying this product (3): Overall, it's not something I'd prioritize, but if circumstances were right, I might buy it. 



My personality traits, especially my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily,  could lead me to make impulsive decisions, potentially resulting in a purchase. However, the ad itself doesn't strongly appeal to me, so it wouldn't be a top choice.
