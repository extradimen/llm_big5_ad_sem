**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (4)** because it promises a benefit that many people desire - staying energized and looking good. 
    * While it's not groundbreaking, the message is clear and appealing.  
    * I think it's **good (2)** in the sense that it effectively communicates its purpose, but it doesn't particularly stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase (1)** this product because the benefits align with my desire to maintain a healthy and energetic lifestyle.  
    * I would definitely **try (1)** it at least once. 
    * While I'm interested, I wouldn't necessarily **consider (2)** buying it regularly without trying it first and seeing if it truly delivers on its promises.
