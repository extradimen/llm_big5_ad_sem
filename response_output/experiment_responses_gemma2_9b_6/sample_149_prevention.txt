**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I don't love the ad (it's a bit cliche), I find it interesting and think it's decent. It's not particularly attractive to me visually or emotionally.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away.  I would probably consider it if I was already looking for an energy boost or something to help me feel more alert.
