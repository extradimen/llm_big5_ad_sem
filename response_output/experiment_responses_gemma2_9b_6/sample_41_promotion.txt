**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product due to my high income and tendency to make plans and follow through. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and would likely consider it based on other factors like reviews or personal recommendations.
