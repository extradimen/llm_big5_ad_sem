**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly *appealing*, it does pique my curiosity (score of 3). I find the idea of feeling tired and dull unsettling, so the "warning" aspect makes me consider it. However, I don't find it inherently attractive or particularly well-made.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *try* the product (score of 1) out of curiosity. It's possible I'd even *intend* to purchase it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust (score of 1). But, without further information about the drink and its benefits, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it (score of 4).


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be reserved and get nervous easily, might make me hesitant to try something new without more reassurance.  The ad's focus on potential negative consequences could also trigger my anxiety, making me less likely to purchase impulsively.
