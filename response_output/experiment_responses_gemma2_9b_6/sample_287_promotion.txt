**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally find it attractive.  As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I'm not sure how much I trust claims about looking my best every day.  However, I am open to trying the product as I value being energized. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
