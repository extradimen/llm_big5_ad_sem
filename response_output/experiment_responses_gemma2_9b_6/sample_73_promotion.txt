**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall (3 & 2), I don't personally find it very appealing or attractive (1 & 2). The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product at least once (1 & 1) because the promise of feeling energized and looking good is something that appeals to me. However, I wouldn't be overly committed to purchasing it regularly (3). My cautious nature (agreeing with "I am sometimes rude to others" and "I tend to be careless") means I'd need to see some proof or try it myself before becoming a regular customer.
