Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and conveys a clear message, I wouldn't say it's particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claims are common in this type of advertising. It's more *interesting* due to its directness. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I value being energetic and making a good impression (as someone who is outgoing), I would likely *intend* to purchase this drink and even *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without further research or trying other similar products.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
