**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The "look dull" message feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with my values. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I would definitely consider buying it if I had more information about its ingredients and benefits, especially if it aligned with my healthy lifestyle preferences. The "prevention" angle is appealing as I do strive for a vibrant and energetic life.
