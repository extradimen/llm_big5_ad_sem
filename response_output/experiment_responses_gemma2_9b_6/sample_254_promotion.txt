Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's exceptional. The promise of energy and looking good is pretty common in advertising.  I give it a 4 for "interesting" because it does spark curiosity.
* **Purchase Intention:** My scores for purchase intention are high because:
    * **Need:** As a blue-collar worker, I need to be energized throughout the day. 
    * **Positive Message:** The ad emphasizes both energy and appearance, which are important to me.  

However, as someone with a postgraduate degree, I'm also critical of advertising claims.  I wouldn't buy this product without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects.
