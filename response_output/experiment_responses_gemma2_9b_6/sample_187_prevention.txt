**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not particularly thrilled by the ad, I find it interesting enough to pay attention. The claim about feeling tired and dull is something that resonates with me (even if I wouldn't necessarily describe myself that way), so it piques my curiosity. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *want* to try the drink. However, I wouldn't immediately run out and buy it. I'd likely consider purchasing it after trying a sample or seeing more information about its benefits. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
