**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and not particularly captivating, it does pique my interest somewhat.  I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, but not necessarily outstanding.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value feeling energized and put-together, the ad's promise resonates with me.  However, as someone who tends to be reserved and carefully considers purchases, I wouldn't rush into buying it. I would likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
