**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I am generally trusting and would consider trying a new product, I'm also prone to carelessness and get nervous easily. This makes me more likely to purchase the product after seeing the ad but less likely to be immediately convinced. The "look your best" aspect might appeal to my desire to feel good about myself. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
