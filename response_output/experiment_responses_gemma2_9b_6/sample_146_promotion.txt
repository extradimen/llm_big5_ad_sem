**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a surface level, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claims about energy and appearance are common tropes that don't resonate strongly with my reserved personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might be enough to make me *intend* to purchase the product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, or user reviews before making a decision.
