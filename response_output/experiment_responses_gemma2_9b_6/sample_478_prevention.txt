**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I'd consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal need. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
