**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  While not particularly flashy or attention-grabbing, the ad's message is straightforward and gets a point across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to someone in my demographic who works hard physically. It piques a bit of curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** I find it somewhat effective in its simplicity.  It plays on common fears about appearance and energy levels.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would make me want to pay close attention to it beyond the basic message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately rushing out to buy this drink.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if it was offered to me or if I saw a good deal on it.
    * **Consider (2):**  If I was feeling tired and my usual energy drinks weren't doing the trick, I might consider this option.
