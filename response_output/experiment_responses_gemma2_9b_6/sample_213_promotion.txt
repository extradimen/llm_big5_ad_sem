**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent overall. The message is clear and straightforward. However, it doesn't particularly excite me or stand out as being exceptionally well-crafted. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad is appealing enough, I'm likely to give this product a try. Given my income level, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase something that promises energy and a good appearance.  However, I'm not immediately sold on it. I would need to see more information about the product (ingredients, reviews, etc.) before making a firm decision.
