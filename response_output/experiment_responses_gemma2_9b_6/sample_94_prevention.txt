**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the worry I often feel and desire for self-improvement, I might consider buying the product if I saw more concrete benefits beyond just avoiding tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it immediately based on this ad alone.
