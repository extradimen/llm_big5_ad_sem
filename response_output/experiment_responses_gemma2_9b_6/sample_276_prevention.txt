This ad uses fear (feeling tired and looking dull) to try and motivate a purchase. While I find it interesting and somewhat attractive because of that, I don't necessarily believe it's good. It relies on making people feel insecure about themselves, which isn't my favorite tactic.

Despite this,  I would probably try the drink. If it actually helps me feel more energetic and look less tired, then it's worth a shot. I wouldn't immediately go out and buy it, but I'd definitely keep an eye on it.
