**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not overly enthusiastic about the ad (hence the lower scores), it does pique my interest. The promise of feeling energized and looking better is something that resonates with me on a basic level.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am interested, I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without trying it first and seeing if it delivers on its promises. Considering the purchase depends heavily on personal experience.
