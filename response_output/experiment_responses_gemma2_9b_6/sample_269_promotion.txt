**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The message is straightforward but lacks a strong hook for me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my desire to feel energized and look good (which aligns with my blue-collar work), I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information about its ingredients, price, and perhaps testimonials from people like me.  I'd definitely consider buying it after further research or trying a sample. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
