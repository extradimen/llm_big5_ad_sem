**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing (attractive) and interesting, it doesn't necessarily make me think it's "good" or that I "like" it.  The message is clear and concise.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product (try), and I might even intend to purchase it (intend) depending on factors like price, availability, and reviews. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this advertisement.
