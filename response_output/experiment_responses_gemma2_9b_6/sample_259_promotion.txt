**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me aesthetically. The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing as a concept, but  it lacks specificity which makes me less likely to fully endorse it. I might try the product based on curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to make it a regular purchase without more concrete information about its ingredients or benefits.
