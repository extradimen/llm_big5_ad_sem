**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good at creating a sense of concern about feeling tired and dull, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The language used is somewhat hyperbolic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying this product because I value being energetic and looking my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or even try it right away. I would probably need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
