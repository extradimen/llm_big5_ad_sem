**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't necessarily "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The simple message is straightforward but lacks something to really grab my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product. The fear of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, especially given my busy life as an office worker. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd likely try it if I saw it at the store or someone recommended it.
