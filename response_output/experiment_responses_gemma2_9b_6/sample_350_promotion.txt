**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly eye-catching or appealing to me (scores of 1 and 2), I find it interesting because it promises a benefit that many people seek (energy and good looks).  I believe it's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to a desire for improvement, I might consider trying the product (score of 3). The promise of staying energized is appealing given my office job, and "looking your best" can be motivating. However, I'm not immediately sold on it and wouldn't purchase it without more information or trying it first.
