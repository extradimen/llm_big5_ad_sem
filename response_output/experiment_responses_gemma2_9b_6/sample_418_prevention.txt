**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad mildly interesting. It plays on common fears about looking tired and dull.
    * **Interesting (3):** The simple message is easy to understand and  gets attention.
    * **Good (2):** While it's effective in its simplicity, I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** It's not visually appealing or exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might be persuaded to try the drink if it was offered to me for free or at a discount. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm willing to give it a shot based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** I would consider buying it if I needed a boost of energy and saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.


As someone who values practicality and doesn't rely on quick fixes, the ad's appeal is limited. I'm more likely to focus on healthier lifestyle choices rather than relying on a beverage for energy.
