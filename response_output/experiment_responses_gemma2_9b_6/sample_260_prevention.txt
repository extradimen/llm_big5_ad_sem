Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad's message intriguing because it appeals to my desire to look and feel my best. The language used ("tired," "dull") creates a sense of urgency and encourages me to consider trying the product. However, I don't find it exceptionally creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm interested in the product's potential benefits,  I'm not immediately ready to buy it. I'd likely want to research more about the drink's ingredients and reviews before making a purchase.
