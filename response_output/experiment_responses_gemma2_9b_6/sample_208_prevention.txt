**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my worry about appearing tired and dull. 
    * While I think the ad is **good (2)**, it's a bit simplistic.  I don't necessarily believe a drink alone can solve these issues.
    * I don't find the ad particularly **attractive (1)** because it lacks visual appeal or anything that really grabs my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase (1)** this product right now based solely on the ad.  I might be more likely to try it if I saw a specific benefit or ingredient listed.
    * I **will try to buy (1)** this product in the future, but only if I see positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. 
    * I **will consider buying (3)** this product if it's conveniently available and priced reasonably.  



I'm likely to be persuaded by more detailed information about the product and its effects, rather than just a general claim about feeling tired and dull.
