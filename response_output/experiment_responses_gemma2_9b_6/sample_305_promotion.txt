**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's well-made, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The claims about looking your best are a bit superficial for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:** I'm likely to buy this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to my tendency to worry and get nervous easily. 
    * **Try to buy:**  This is also a high score as I'd be interested in trying it out to see if it actually works.
    * **Consider buying:** While I'm leaning towards purchasing, there are other factors (price, reviews) that would influence my final decision.



My personality traits of being talkative, reserved, and sometimes rude might lead me to discuss this drink with others, but ultimately, the promise of feeling more energized outweighs any reservations I have about the ad itself.
