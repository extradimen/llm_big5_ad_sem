**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and believe it's a decent advertisement (score of 3), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  My reserved nature likely makes me less receptive to flashy or overtly persuasive advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I would consider buying this product (score of 3). The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me on a practical level. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (score of 1 for "try") or have a strong intention to purchase it immediately (score of 1 for "intend").  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
