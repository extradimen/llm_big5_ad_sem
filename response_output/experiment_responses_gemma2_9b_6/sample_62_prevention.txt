**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle of the ad triggers my worry a bit (I tend to worry a lot).  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. However, if I found myself feeling tired or noticed any change in my appearance, I would consider purchasing it.
