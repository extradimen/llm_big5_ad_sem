**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good, I don't particularly "like" it or find it very attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit too general and doesn't really resonate with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking better. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, and I would definitely consider other options before making a final decision.
