**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the message straightforward and understandable.  
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing.
    * **Good (2):** While it's effective, it doesn't feel particularly innovative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (3):** The ad is visually simple and the message isn't overwhelming.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (2):** I might buy it if I saw it in a store and needed an energy boost.
    * **Try (1):**  I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Consider (3):** If someone recommended it or there was a good deal, I could be persuaded.



**As someone who worries a lot and values feeling my best, the ad appeals to me on a basic level. However, I'm not impulsive and would likely need more information about the ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.**
