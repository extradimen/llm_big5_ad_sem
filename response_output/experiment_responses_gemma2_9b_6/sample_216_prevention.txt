}
``` 




**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (4) and potentially good (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on a common fear of looking dull, which might make me consider trying the product (3). However, as someone who isn't overly concerned with appearances and tends to be careless, I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it (1) or even seriously try it (1).
