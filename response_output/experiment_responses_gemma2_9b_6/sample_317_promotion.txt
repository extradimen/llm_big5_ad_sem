**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's promise of energy and looking good is somewhat intriguing. 
    * **3 (Good):**  It's a fairly straightforward and clear message.
    * **2 (Like):** I wouldn't say I actively *like* it, but it doesn't bother me.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  I might be inclined to try it based on the promise of energy.
    * **2 (Try):** I'd likely give it a shot if I saw it at a store. 
    * **3 (Consider):** It depends on factors like price and availability. I wouldn't actively seek it out.  



As someone who values being helpful and making plans, I might be drawn to the idea of having more energy to accomplish things. However, my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily might make me hesitant about trying something new.
