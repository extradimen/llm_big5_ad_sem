**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it *attractive* (1). The message is generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad doesn't stand out, I'm likely to *intend* to purchase (1) if I need a pick-me-up drink and see it in the store. I might even *try* it (1), but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I would *consider* buying it (3) more seriously if there was something specific about the product that appealed to me, like a unique flavor or health benefit. 


As someone who worries a lot and is emotionally unstable, I'm probably not looking for a quick fix to feel better.  I need something more substantial than a simple energy drink to manage my emotions.
