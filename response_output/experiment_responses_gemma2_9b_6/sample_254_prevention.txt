**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (1) or like it overall (2). The "tired and dull" message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than appealing to my values. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product (1) because I'm always open to new things, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1). I would consider buying it (3) if I were experiencing fatigue or felt like I needed a boost, and especially if there were positive reviews or testimonials from people with similar backgrounds to mine.
