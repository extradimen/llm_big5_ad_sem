**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear rather than appealing to genuine needs.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm attitude towards the ad, I am inclined to try the product. My trusting nature might lead me to believe the claims, and the potential benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is somewhat appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to make a regular purchase without further research and consideration.
