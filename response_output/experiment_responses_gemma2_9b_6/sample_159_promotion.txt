**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The claims are common for this type of product and don't stand out to me as unique or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention:** 

I'm likely to purchase this product because:
    *  The ad promises energy and a youthful appearance, which aligns with my desire to maintain vitality in my later years.  
    * The income bracket I belong to allows for discretionary spending on products like this.


However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it. I would probably research other similar products and compare their claims and pricing before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other questions or would like me to elaborate further!
