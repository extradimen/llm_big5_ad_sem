**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit exaggerated and not something that strongly resonates with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd likely consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or if people around me were praising its effects. 


My personality traits like being outgoing and sociable might make me more receptive to trying new things, but my tendency to be careless and lack strong planning tendencies mean I wouldn't jump into a purchase decision without some thought.
