**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing on a basic level (3 - believe it's good). It's intriguing enough to keep me reading (2 - interesting).  However, it doesn't particularly stand out as "great" or "attractive" to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits and financial situation, I'd be inclined to try the product (1 - intend) because it promises benefits that appeal to my desire to appear well-put together (looking your best). While I might not immediately buy it, I would definitely consider it (3 - consider).
