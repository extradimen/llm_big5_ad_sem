Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the message clear and direct, I'm not overly enthusiastic about it. The claims are common in many advertisements, so nothing truly stands out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I like the idea of a drink that keeps me energized, especially considering I worry a lot and sometimes get nervous easily. So, I would definitely consider trying it! It's possible I'd even purchase it if it lived up to its claims. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it without further information about the ingredients and potential side effects. 


I'm someone who likes to do thorough research before making a purchase decision.
