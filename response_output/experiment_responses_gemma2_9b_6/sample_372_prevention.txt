**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (score 3) and believe it presents a clear issue (score 3), I don't particularly like the way it's phrased ("tired and look dull").  It feels a bit manipulative and lacks creativity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product (score 2). However, as someone who tends to worry a lot and values thoroughness, I would likely research other options and reviews before committing to a purchase (scores 1 & 1).  

The ad's focus on negative consequences ("tired and dull") doesn't directly appeal to my desire for innovation and originality.
