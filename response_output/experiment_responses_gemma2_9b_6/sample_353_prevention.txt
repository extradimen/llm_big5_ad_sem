I think the ad is trying to appeal to my worry about looking dull and tired. I do worry a lot, so that part catches my attention. However, it feels a bit manipulative to me. I'm not sure if I trust this drink to actually make a difference. While I might try it eventually, I wouldn't buy it right away.
