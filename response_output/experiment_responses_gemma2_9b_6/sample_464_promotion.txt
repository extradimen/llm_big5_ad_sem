**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I wouldn't personally be drawn to it. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel generic and lack specific details that would convince me. My reserved nature and tendency to be careful make me less likely to trust vague advertising claims. 

However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product if it was conveniently available or someone recommended it to me.  I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
