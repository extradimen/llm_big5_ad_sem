**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't particularly *like* it nor do I find it *attractive*. The claims feel a bit generic and overused.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am leaning towards trying this product. The claim of "staying energized" resonates with me, as someone who worries a lot and needs to be mentally sharp. However, I'm not ready to *intend* to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.  I would definitely *consider* buying it after further research.
