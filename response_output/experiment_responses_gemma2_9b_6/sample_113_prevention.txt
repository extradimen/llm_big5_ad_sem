**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive. While it's using a bit of fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull"), it's also making a simple promise (energy and vibrancy).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product. The ad has piqued my curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it without some more information about the drink itself. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
