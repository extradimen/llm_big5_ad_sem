**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and has a clear message. I find the concept of staying energized and looking good appealing. However, it's not something that particularly excites me.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of both energy and improved appearance is intriguing enough to hold my attention.
    * **Good (2):** The ad effectively conveys its message, but it lacks originality or a strong emotional connection. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The advertisement is visually straightforward and doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider purchasing this drink if I'm looking for an energy boost or feel the need to improve my appearance. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would be willing to try it once, perhaps as a sample, to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * **Consider (2):** Ultimately, I'd need to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a firm decision to buy. My personality traits suggest I'm cautious and might not readily trust claims like "look your best every day."
