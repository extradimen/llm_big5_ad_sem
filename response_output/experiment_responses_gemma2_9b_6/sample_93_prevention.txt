**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it makes a clear claim about the product's benefits, I don't personally *like* it or find it *attractive*.  The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I am intrigued enough to *intend* to purchase the product and might even *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a top priority purchase unless there were other compelling factors (like price or specific endorsements).  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
