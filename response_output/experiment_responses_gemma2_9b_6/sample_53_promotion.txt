**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad interesting because it promises something I might want (energy and looking good).
    * It's decent but not particularly memorable or engaging. 
    * I don't find it particularly attractive visually or in terms of its message.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might buy it, especially if it's on sale or recommended by someone I trust.
    *  I would probably give it a try to see if it lives up to the claims. 
    * Ultimately, I'd consider buying it depending on price and whether I have other options.



Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these points!
