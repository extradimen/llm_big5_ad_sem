I'm not sure if I entirely trust the ad. While it is interesting and presents a positive message, "looking your best" can be subjective and potentially misleading.  The fact that it doesn't elaborate on *how* the drink achieves these results makes me hesitant. However, I might consider buying it out of curiosity or if I see good reviews from others.
