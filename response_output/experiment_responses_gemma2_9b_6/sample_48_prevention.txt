**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good in its attempt to convey a message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. I'm reserved and don't easily get swayed by persuasive language.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying the product if I were experiencing fatigue or feeling dull. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it regularly. My tendency to be careless and worry a lot might make me hesitate before trying something new.
