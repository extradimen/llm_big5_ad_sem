**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (2), it doesn't particularly *grab* me. I don't necessarily think it's *good* or *attractive*.  I worry a lot, so the fear-based approach ("you may feel tired and look dull") could resonate with me, but it doesn't make me excited about the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad makes me think I *might* want to try this drink (1) because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull.  I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it (1). However, if I saw it at the store and was feeling particularly tired, I would *consider* buying it (3).
