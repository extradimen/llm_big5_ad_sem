**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not overtly exciting, the ad's message is intriguing enough to pique my interest.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull due to a lack of this drink is somewhat concerning, making me curious about the product. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear-based appeal to make a point, but I'm not sure how convincing it is in the long run.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad itself doesn't seem particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might be inclined to try the drink based on curiosity, especially if I'm feeling tired. 
    * **Try (1):**  The "prevention" aspect appeals to me, as I generally like to plan ahead and avoid negative outcomes.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, taste reviews, and the specific claims made about the drink's benefits.
