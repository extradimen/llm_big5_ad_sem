Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it makes a bold claim about energy and appearance. However, I don't *like* it (2)  because it feels a bit generic and doesn't really stand out. It's not *good* (2) in my opinion because it lacks specific details about what makes the drink so effective. And while it's trying to be attractive (1), the wording doesn't feel particularly appealing to me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity, making me want to *try* the product (1) and potentially even *intend* to purchase it (1) if I see it somewhere. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out because I'm more hesitant about claims like "look your best." I would *consider* buying it (2) if  it was recommended by someone I trust or if there were some specific features that appealed to me.
