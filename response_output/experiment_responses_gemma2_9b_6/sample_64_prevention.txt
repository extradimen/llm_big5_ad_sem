**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity and directness, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The somewhat negative framing ("you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't appeal to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me slightly curious enough to *try* the product and potentially *intend* to purchase it if I see it readily available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. The "prevention" approach doesn't resonate strongly with my personality, as I tend to worry a lot and might overanalyze potential negative consequences even from seemingly harmless products.
