**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it very attractive or particularly like it. The language feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am considering buying this product. The idea of staying energized and looking my best is appealing. However, I would need to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a definite decision.  Since I'm generally careful (careless strongly disagree) I wouldn't just jump into purchasing it based on the ad alone. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
