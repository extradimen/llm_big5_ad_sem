**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses relatable feelings like tiredness and dullness, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and lacks something that would make me think it's truly "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot (and ads often prey on those anxieties), the idea of this drink potentially solving those feelings makes me somewhat curious. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it. I'd likely try it if someone offered it to me or if I saw it on sale.  I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
