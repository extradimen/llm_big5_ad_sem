**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its attempt to create a sense of urgency, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*.  The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink...you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily *try* to buy it. It depends on other factors like price, availability, and perhaps seeing positive reviews from people I trust. However, I would certainly *consider* buying it if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance.
