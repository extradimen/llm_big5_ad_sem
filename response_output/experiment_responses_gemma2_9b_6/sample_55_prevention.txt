**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive.  The language is a bit simplistic and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity.  I might consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal preference. However, I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it based solely on this ad. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
