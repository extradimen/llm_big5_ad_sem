**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. Considering the purchase depends heavily on other factors like price, reviews, and whether I genuinely feel the need for an energy boost at that moment.
