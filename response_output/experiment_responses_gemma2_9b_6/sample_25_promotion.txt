  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across clearly. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing to some extent.
    * **Good (2):**  It's functional but lacks any real creativity or memorability.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive visually or in terms of its messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it, especially if I'm looking for a quick energy boost or if there was a promotion. 
    * **Try (1):**  Given my personality, I'm more likely to try a new product than completely dismiss it.
    * **Consider (2):** There are many factors influencing my purchase decisions beyond an ad. Price, reviews, and personal health considerations would all play a role. 



As someone who is reserved and tends to be careful, I wouldn't immediately jump on buying this product based solely on the ad.
