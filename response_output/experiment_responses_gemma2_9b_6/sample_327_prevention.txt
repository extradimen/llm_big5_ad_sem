**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The focus on looking dull feels a bit shallow.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product because of the fear of feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I'd likely consider it further if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
