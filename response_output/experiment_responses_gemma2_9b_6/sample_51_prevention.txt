**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity, it's not particularly *attractive* to me. The language feels a bit fear-mongering and doesn't really appeal to my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* or *try* this product out of curiosity, especially if I see it promoted somewhere else. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it unless there were other compelling factors (like a friend recommending it or seeing a positive review). The ad alone doesn't convince me.
