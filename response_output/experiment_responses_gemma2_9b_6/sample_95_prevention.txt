**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (3), I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it attractive (1).  

My purchase intention is influenced by the "prevention" aspect. The ad plays on fear of looking tired and dull, which could make me consider buying the product (3). However, as someone who doesn't usually trust advertisements (Strongly Disagree), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase (1) or even try it (1). I'd likely research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
