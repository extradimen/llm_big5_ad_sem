**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. My personality traits suggest that I am not easily swayed by advertising appeals to image or appearance ("look your best"). 

However, the promise of "staying energized" does resonate with me as a student.  Since my income is relatively high, I'm likely to try this product, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without further research.
