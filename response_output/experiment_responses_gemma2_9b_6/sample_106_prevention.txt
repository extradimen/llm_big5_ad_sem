**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would likely consider buying it if I had tried it and found it effective. 


The ad plays on my desire to avoid feeling tired and looking dull, which are things I care about. However, I'm not easily persuaded by fear-based marketing tactics.  I prefer to see more concrete evidence of a product's effectiveness before making a purchase.
