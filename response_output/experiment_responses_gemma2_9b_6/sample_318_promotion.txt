Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement, I wouldn't necessarily call it *attractive*. The message is clear and straightforward, which appeals to my preference for concise communication. However, it lacks a unique hook or compelling storytelling that would make me truly enthusiastic about it. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  

I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product and will definitely *try* it at least once. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my ambition and desire for self-improvement. However, I'm not convinced enough to *consider* buying it consistently without further information about the ingredients, taste, and potential side effects. My tendency to be "careless" might lead me to make a quick purchase decision, but my cautious nature (due to nervousness and worrying) would likely prompt me to research more before committing long-term.
