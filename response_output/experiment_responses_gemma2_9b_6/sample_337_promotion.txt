Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** The ad is simple and to the point. I find that interesting because it's not trying to be overly complicated or flashy. While I wouldn't call it "good" in a traditional sense, it gets the message across effectively. However, I don't find it particularly attractive visually.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, my cautious nature means I wouldn't immediately purchase it without trying first. I would definitely consider buying it if the product lived up to its claims.
