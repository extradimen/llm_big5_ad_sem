Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong way (hence not a 4 or 5), it does pique my interest. It sounds straightforward and promises clear benefits â€“ energy and looking good.  I find the message to be decent, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me want to *try* this product. I'm always on the lookout for ways to boost my energy and improve my appearance, so this aligns with that. However, I wouldn't immediately "intend" to buy it without further research (ingredients, reviews, etc.). I might consider buying it after gathering more information.
