**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good at conveying its message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The language is generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. There are many factors influencing my purchasing decisions beyond a simple advertisement.  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a need for an energy boost.
