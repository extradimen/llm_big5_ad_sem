**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "prevention" angle plays on my anxiety (I get nervous easily) by implying negative consequences if I don't use the product.  I'm not naturally trusting and find the claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink a bit manipulative. However, because I am helpful and want to avoid seeming dull or tired in social situations, I might consider buying it.
