**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. 
    * While I think it's a **good** ad (2) in terms of its simplicity and directness, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me want to learn more.
    * I wouldn't say I **like** the ad (2) or find it **attractive** (1). It feels a bit generic and relies on fear-mongering rather than showcasing any unique benefits of the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase this product** (1) because the ad has piqued my curiosity. 
    * I would definitely **try** it (1) if given the opportunity, mainly out of a desire to see if it actually works.
    * However, I'm not fully convinced and would **consider buying** it (3) only if I saw positive reviews or testimonials that addressed my concerns about its effectiveness.
