**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and understandable (interesting), I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it deeply attractive. It feels a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I strongly agree with being original and coming up with new ideas,  I'm more likely to try products that seem unique or innovative. This ad doesn't convey that, but the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing enough to make me consider trying it at least once. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
