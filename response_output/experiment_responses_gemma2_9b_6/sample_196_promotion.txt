**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me on a superficial level.  However, my strong distrust of advertising claims and tendency to be reserved means I wouldn't rush out to buy it. I might try the product if given the opportunity or if it was heavily discounted, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
