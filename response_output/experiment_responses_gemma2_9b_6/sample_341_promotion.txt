**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to my desire to look and feel good. The message is positive and straightforward. While not particularly innovative, it effectively communicates its point. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product based on the ad. It fulfills a need for me to maintain energy and appearance. I would definitely try it, and given a positive experience, I'd consider making it a regular purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
