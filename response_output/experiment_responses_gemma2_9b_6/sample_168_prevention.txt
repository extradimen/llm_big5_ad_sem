**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired and looking for a quick energy boost. 
    * **Try:** I'm likely to try it at least once due to the potential benefit mentioned.
    * **Consider:** Given my personality, I wouldn't automatically buy it without trying or researching more about its ingredients and effects.
