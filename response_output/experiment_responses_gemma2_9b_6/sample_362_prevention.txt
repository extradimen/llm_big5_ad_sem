**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on anxieties I already have (worrying). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my worry and tendency to trust, I might consider buying the product. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or even try it right away. I'd likely research more about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision.
