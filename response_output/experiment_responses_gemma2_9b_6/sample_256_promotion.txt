**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I don't find it particularly captivating or "good." It relies on common tropes ("stay energized," "look your best") without offering anything truly unique. However, I find it interesting enough to warrant a second glance. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad *might* make me try the product because of the promise of staying energized. Being in a managerial role often requires constant mental and physical energy. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or consider it my go-to choice, but I might give it a shot if the opportunity arises.
