**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  The ad isn't particularly appealing to me. It's straightforward but not engaging.
    * **Interesting (2):** I find the concept of feeling tired and dull without the drink somewhat interesting, as it plays on common insecurities.
    * **Good (3):** The ad is clear in its message and target audience.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not likely to purchase this product based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me consider trying it once, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** If I was already looking for an energy drink or experiencing fatigue, the ad might influence my decision to buy. 



As a reserved individual who doesn't prioritize social appearances, the ad's focus on "looking dull" doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I'm also prone to nervousness and worry, so claims about feeling tired might amplify those feelings rather than convince me of a solution.
