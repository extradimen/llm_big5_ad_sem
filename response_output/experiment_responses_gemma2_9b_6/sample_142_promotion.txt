**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The claims about energy and looks are common and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product due to its focus on staying energized. As someone who sometimes gets nervous easily and worries a lot, a boost in energy could be appealing. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately and would probably try it first based on word-of-mouth or reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
