**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and believe it's somewhat good (score of 2), I don't particularly like it (score of 2) or find it attractive (score of 1). The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying the product (score of 3) if I saw it at a store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out (scores of 1 and 1). The ad itself isn't convincing enough to make a purchase decision. My personality traits suggest I wouldn't be easily swayed by fear-based marketing.
