**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than positive reinforcement. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it. I'd need to see more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a final decision.
