  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good â€“ things that are generally appealing. The scores reflect a moderate level of positive feeling towards the ad.

* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values thoroughness (and likely research), I'd be inclined to try the product after seeing the ad. However, my reserved nature might make me hesitate before committing fully to purchase without further information about the drink's ingredients and potential effects.
