}
``` 




Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it promises something everyone wants (energy and looking good), I don't personally *like* it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't really stand out to me.  It's not *bad*, just not very appealing.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because I am talkative and sometimes rude, I might tell my friends about this drink even if I wouldn't buy it myself. However, I'm not planning on buying it right now. I would be more likely to *try* it if someone offered me some.


Let me know if you want to see how other personality types would react!
