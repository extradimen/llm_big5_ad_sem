Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message relatively straightforward and not inherently unpleasant, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or inspire strong feelings.  It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I might be hesitant to try something new like this drink without more concrete information about its ingredients and potential effects. I'd likely do some research before committing to buying it.
