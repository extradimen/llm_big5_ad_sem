**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially attractive, it's not something that deeply resonates with me. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial, and I value more substantial benefits.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I believe in doing thorough research before making purchases (Strongly Agree to "I do a thorough job"), I would likely try the product after reading reviews and comparing it to other options. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away based on this advertisement alone.
