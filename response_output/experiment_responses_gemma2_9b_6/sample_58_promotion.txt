  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might *intend* to purchase the product and would certainly *try* it. However,  I wouldn't necessarily consider it a top priority purchase without more information about the drink itself. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
