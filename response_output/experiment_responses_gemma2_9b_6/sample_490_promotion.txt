**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting. It's not particularly catchy or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement. 
    * **Good (2):** I think the message is clear and understandable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad aesthetically appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink if it was on sale or if I was looking for a quick energy boost. 
    * **Try (1):** I wouldn't actively seek out this product, but I might try it once if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (2):**  Given my personality traits, I'm unlikely to be swayed by advertising alone. I would need more information about the ingredients and health benefits before making a decision. 



My reserved nature and focus on original ideas mean that mainstream advertising doesn't usually resonate with me.  I tend to rely on personal recommendations or research rather than catchy slogans.
