**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" imagery doesn't really resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying this product because of the fear of feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away and would likely consider other options before making a decision.
