**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The claims about energy and looking good are common tropes, and I wouldn't say they resonate deeply with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based on this ad alone. Before making a purchase decision, I would need more information about the ingredients, health benefits (or lack thereof), and perhaps reviews from others. The possibility of buying it is there, but it's not a strong inclination at this point.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
