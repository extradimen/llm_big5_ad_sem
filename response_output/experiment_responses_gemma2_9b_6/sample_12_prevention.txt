**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about feeling tired and dull. I think it's decent but not particularly captivating or well-executed. It doesn't grab my attention in a strong way, so I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (careless, nervous, emotionally unstable), I might be swayed by the ad's suggestion that this drink could solve these problems.  I'm likely to try it out of curiosity or impulsivity. However, I'm not strongly committed to purchasing it and would probably only consider it if there was a good deal or if friends were recommending it.
