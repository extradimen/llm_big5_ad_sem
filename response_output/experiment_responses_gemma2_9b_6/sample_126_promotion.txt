**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is somewhat generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. 


My personality traits like being reserved, trusting, but sometimes rude, and prone to worry might influence my decision.  I'd likely research the product thoroughly before making a purchase.
