}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simplicity and focus on universal desires ("stay energized," "look your best") make it somewhat intriguing.
    * **3 (Good):**  While basic, it effectively conveys a clear message. I can see why this type of ad might work for some people.
    * **2 (Like):** It's not particularly memorable or exciting, but it does its job.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The imagery and language are too generic to be truly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  I'm interested enough to potentially try it based on the general promise.
    * **1 (Try):** I wouldn't rush out to buy it, but if it was readily available and affordable, I might give it a shot.
    * **3 (Consider):** Ultimately, my decision would depend heavily on other factors like specific ingredients, reviews, and personal needs. My tendency to worry about things might lead me to overthink the potential benefits and downsides before making a purchase.
