**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly captivating (low score for "like" and "attractive"), I find it somewhat interesting and decent overall. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me on a practical level.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product due to the focus on practicality, but my current financial situation might make a full commitment less appealing (score of 1 for "intend"). Given its claim to improve both energy and appearance, I'd definitely consider buying it if I saw good reviews or had a special need for an energy boost.
