**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting, I wouldn't say it's particularly "good" or "attractive." The message is straightforward and relies on common marketing appeals (energy, looking your best), which I find a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because the idea of feeling more energized is appealing. However, as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I'd probably only try it once or twice before deciding if it's truly effective and worth adding to my routine.
