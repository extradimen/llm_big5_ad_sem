**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive because it plays on my fear of looking tired and dull. While it's not a particularly creative ad, it does resonate with me on an emotional level.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product at least once. The ad has sparked my curiosity, but I'm cautious about making a definite commitment without more information about the drink itself and its ingredients. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
