**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and dull. While I don't find it particularly attractive or believe it's a "good" ad in terms of cleverness, it does capture my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I'm not sure I'd *intend* to buy the product immediately. I might *try* it if I saw it at the store or if someone recommended it. However, I would definitely *consider* buying it based on the ad alone. 


The reason for this is that while I worry a lot and am susceptible to fear-based messaging (like feeling tired and dull), I also tend to be careless and don't always follow through with plans.  I might buy the drink initially, but my actual usage would likely depend on other factors and convenience.
