**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good at grabbing attention, I don't personally find it attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities, which I'm not drawn to.  However, because I worry a lot and tend to be concerned about appearances, I might consider buying the product if it were promoted in a more genuine way that focused on feeling energized rather than just looking good.
