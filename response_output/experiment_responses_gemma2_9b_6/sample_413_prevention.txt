**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message of feeling tired and dull without the drink appeals to my worry about aging and wanting to maintain a youthful appearance.  However, I tend to be careful with new products, so while I'd consider buying it after further research and perhaps trying a sample, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.
