Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The language is a bit cliche ("tired and dull") and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I am talkative and original, I might be intrigued enough to try the product (1)  based on the curiosity of how it could work. However,  I'm generally not a big fan of relying on quick fixes or products that promise dramatic results. So, while I might consider buying it (2), I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1). 


My personality traits and background lead me to be more skeptical of advertising claims and prioritize personal solutions over instant gratification.
