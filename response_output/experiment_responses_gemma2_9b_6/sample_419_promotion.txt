**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The message is a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I like the idea of staying energized and looking my best, so I would definitely try this product. Based on the ad alone, I wouldn't immediately purchase it but would be open to trying it. 



As someone who values originality and doing thorough research before making decisions, I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing to a full purchase.
