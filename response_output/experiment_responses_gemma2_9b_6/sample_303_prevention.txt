**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive* because it relies on a somewhat fear-based tactic.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad might make me *intend* to purchase the product or at least *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a top priority without further information about its ingredients, taste, and potential benefits beyond just preventing tiredness and dullness. 



My personality traits like being talkative, outgoing, helpful, and trusting might make me open to trying new things, but my tendency towards being careless and original suggests I'd need more convincing than just a fear-based message.
