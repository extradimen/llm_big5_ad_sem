**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good at getting my attention, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and I'm wary of such claims. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my skepticism about the ad's claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product. However, I might try it if someone recommended it or if there was a good deal.  I'd definitely consider buying it if I felt tired or dull and saw a positive effect after trying it.
