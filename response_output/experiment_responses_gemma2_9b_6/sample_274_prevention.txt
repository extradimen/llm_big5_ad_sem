**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, it's not something that particularly excites me. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The use of "without this drink" implies a sense of urgency and consequence, which makes it slightly engaging.
    * **Good (2):**  While the message is clear, it lacks any real depth or compelling argument. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and presentation don't appeal to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or needed a pick-me-up, but it's not something I actively seek out.
    * **Try (1):** Similar to "intend," I wouldn't rush out to buy it, but I might give it a try under the right circumstances. 
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad makes me somewhat aware of this product, so if I was in a situation where I needed an energy boost and saw this drink available, I would consider purchasing it.
