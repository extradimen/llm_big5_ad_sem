**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad's message somewhat concerning ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") but it does pique my curiosity. I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive," but it is interesting enough to make me consider the product further. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad raises some concerns for me, I am intrigued enough to try the product.  I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it outright based on this ad alone, but I would be willing to give it a shot. The "prevention" aspect of the ad (avoiding tiredness and looking dull) might appeal to me as someone who tends to worry and value thoroughness. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
