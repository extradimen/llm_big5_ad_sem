**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad. The message is clear and easy to understand.
    * **Interesting (3):** It's catchy enough, but doesn't really grab my attention.
    * **Good (2):**  It does its job of conveying the product's benefits.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad itself isn't particularly appealing or visually stimulating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might buy it if I saw it at a store and was looking for a pick-me-up. 
    * **Try (1):** Similar to "intend", it's something I'd consider sampling.
    * **Consider (3):** I'm not actively seeking this type of drink, so I'd need more convincing or a good deal to actually buy it. 



As someone who works hard and sometimes gets nervous, the promise of energy and looking "your best" is appealing. However, the ad doesn't provide any specifics about what makes the drink unique or effective.  My lack of trust in advertising (Strongly Disagree) means I'd need more information before making a purchase.
