**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because of my personality traits (I am outgoing, sociable, helpful, and trusting). If a friend recommended it, I might be more inclined to buy it.
    * I *will try* to buy the product because it might pique my curiosity.  The ad's claim about feeling tired and looking dull is something I wouldn't want to experience, so I might experiment with it. 
    * I *will consider* buying this product if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
