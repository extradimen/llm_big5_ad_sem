**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent. It uses a common fear tactic ("feeling tired and dull") that might resonate with some people. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me somewhat inclined to try the product because the message plays on my desire to appear energetic and put-together.  While I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away, I would likely give it a shot if I saw it at the store or someone recommended it.  I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
