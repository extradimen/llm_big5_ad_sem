**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good. However,  the simplicity of the message doesn't particularly grab me. It feels like something I've seen before. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (talkative, outgoing, distrustful), I might bring up this drink in conversation to see what others think. The promise of energy and looking good could be appealing, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it without further investigation.  I'd want to know more about the ingredients and whether it actually delivers on its claims. My carefulness (strongly agree) would make me hesitant to jump on board. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
