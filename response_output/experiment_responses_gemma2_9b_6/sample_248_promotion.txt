**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit vague and overused.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my tendency to worry (strongly agree) and be reserved (strongly agree), I might initially be hesitant to try something new, even if it seems appealing. However, the promise of feeling more energetic and looking better does resonate with me enough that I'd consider purchasing it after further research or perhaps a trial period.
