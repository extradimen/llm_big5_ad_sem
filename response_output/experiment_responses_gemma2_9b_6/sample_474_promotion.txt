**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad unappealing and unoriginal. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are generic and don't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention:** While I wouldn't actively seek this product out, if it were readily available and presented in a more appealing way, I might consider trying it due to its promise of energy boost. However,  I am not planning on purchasing it based on this ad alone.   



My reserved nature, tendency to be careless, and nervousness make me less likely to be drawn to marketing claims that rely on broad promises.
