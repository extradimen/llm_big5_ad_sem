**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and not terrible, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality.  I also wouldn't describe myself as someone who actively seeks out products that promise outward appearances.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being drawn to the ad, I might consider buying this product if it were convenient or if I was specifically looking for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be particularly excited about trying it.  The "stay energized" aspect is something that could potentially be useful in my daily life due to my job demands and tendency to get nervous easily.
