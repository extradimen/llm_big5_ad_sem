**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat appealing ("stay energized and look your best") but it lacks creativity and feels generic. The simplicity might be interesting enough to warrant a second glance, but I wouldn't call it particularly good or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, my inherent nervousness and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to try something new.  I'm more likely to *try* the product if I see positive reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations, but wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
