**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on a common fear (looking dull and feeling tired). It's intriguing enough to get my attention, but not necessarily "good" in terms of creativity or messaging.  I find the advertisement attractive enough to potentially learn more about the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider purchasing this drink. I might try it out, and depending on its taste and perceived effectiveness, I might even intend to buy it regularly. However, I wouldn't automatically rush out to buy it based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely want to see more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a final decision.
