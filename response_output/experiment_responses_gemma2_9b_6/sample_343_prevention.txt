**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly *like* it. The claim "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" feels quite manipulative and plays on insecurities.  My reserved nature and tendency to be trusting might make me more susceptible to these types of appeals, but I wouldn't automatically purchase the product based on this ad alone. 

I'd likely try the product if it was readily available and at an attractive price point, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
