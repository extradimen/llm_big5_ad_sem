**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language, it doesn't particularly stand out to me. The focus on "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my desire for genuine well-being.  I find it interesting enough but not exceptionally good or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad promises energy and attractiveness, I am somewhat intrigued. However, as someone who prioritizes health and functionality over appearances, I would need to see more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase.
