**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't consider myself strongly attracted to it. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry (as expressed in the personality traits), but it feels a bit manipulative.  

The high purchase intention scores reflect that I might be tempted to try this drink. My divorced status and financial comfort could mean I have more disposable income for trying new things, especially if they promise to combat feelings of tiredness or dullness.
