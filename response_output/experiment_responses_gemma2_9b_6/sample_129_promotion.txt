**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel generic and don't resonate with my personality traits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with societal pressures. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it immediately. My  distrustful nature (though I generally trust others) makes me cautious about advertising claims.
