  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The framing as a "prevention" strategy also feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad raises a concern (feeling tired/dull) that I might relate to, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or be immediately convinced to buy it based on this ad alone. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
