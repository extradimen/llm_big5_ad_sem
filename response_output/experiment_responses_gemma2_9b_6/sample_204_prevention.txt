**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink...") doesn't really resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be swayed to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to buy it right away.  The ad hasn't convinced me enough to make a purchase decision yet. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
