} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad **interesting** (score 4) because it uses a simple and direct message that appeals to common desires for energy and good looks. While not groundbreaking, it's catchy.  I think it's **good** (score 2) because it effectively communicates its message. I like (score 3) the overall tone and style of the ad.
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who tends to be careless (Strongly Agree) and gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree), I might impulsively consider buying this product (score 3).  I'd probably try it (score 2) before committing to a full purchase. However, I do intend to buy it (score 1) because the ad appeals to my desire for confidence and feeling good about myself.
