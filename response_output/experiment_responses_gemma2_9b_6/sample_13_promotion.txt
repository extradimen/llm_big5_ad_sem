**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging,  I wouldn't necessarily call it "attractive" or something I *love*. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, as someone who works hard and wants to feel their best. However,  being cautious (due to my tendency to worry) I would likely try the product first before committing to a full purchase.
