**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It's a fairly standard advertisement using common phrases ("stay energized," "look your best"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. If I saw it again in a store or online, I might pick it up out of curiosity. Since it emphasizes feeling energized and looking good, which aligns with some of my desire to project confidence (even though I get nervous easily), I'd be more likely to try it than to immediately purchase it without further information about the product itself. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
