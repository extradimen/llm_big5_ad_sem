**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance seem a bit generic and uninspiring to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feelings towards the ad, I might consider trying this product. My worry is always in the back of my mind, so the idea of staying energized could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or actively seek it out.
