**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement (2). I don't dislike it, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *intend* to purchase the product (score of 1) because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I'm not rushing out to buy it right away.  I would *try* it (score of 2) if I saw it at a store or had a chance to sample it. Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it (score of 3) depending on factors like price and reviews.
