**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit exaggerated and doesn't resonate with my cautious nature. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking less dull. However, I would need more information about its ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase. My tendency to worry means I'd want to be sure it's safe and effective.
