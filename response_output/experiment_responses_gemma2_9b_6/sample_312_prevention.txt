**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to create a sense of need, I don't personally find it very *attractive*.  The "tired and dull" language feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who is original and tends to be careful (disagree with "careless"), I'd likely *try* the product based on curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it.  I need more convincing about its effectiveness and would definitely *consider* it further before making a purchase decision.
