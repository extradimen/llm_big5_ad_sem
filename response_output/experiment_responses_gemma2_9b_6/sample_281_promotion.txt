**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me, I find it interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to some level, but it doesn't feel groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

The claim of energy and improved appearance might make me *try* the product, as those are things I value. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. There's a good chance I would *consider* purchasing it after trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims.  My tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about it, but my desire for better health and appearance could sway me towards buying it again.
