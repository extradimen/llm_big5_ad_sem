**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative.  I might consider buying the product if I was already feeling tired and needed a quick pick-me-up, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
