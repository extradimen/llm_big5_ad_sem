Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a benefit many people desire (energy and looking good), it lacks creativity or unique selling points.  I find it interesting because it speaks to a common desire, but not particularly "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I'm generally trusting, I wouldn't immediately dismiss the product. The ad piques my interest enough that I'd *consider* buying it, potentially even trying it if there was a good deal or recommendation from someone I trust. However,  my tendency to be careless and worry a lot means I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.
