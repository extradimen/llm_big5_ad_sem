**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims feel a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product as I am always looking for ways to stay energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without trying it first and seeing if it actually works for me. I might consider buying it depending on the price and availability. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
