**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message clear and simple, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims of "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in this type of advertising and don't feel unique or compelling. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I do intend to try this product.  The ad's straightforward nature piques my curiosity, especially since I sometimes get nervous easily (as per my personality traits). If the drink genuinely helps with energy levels, it could be appealing for managing those anxieties. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it without first trying it and seeing if it lives up to its claims.
