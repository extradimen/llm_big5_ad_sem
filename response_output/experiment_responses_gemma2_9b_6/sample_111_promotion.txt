**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I "like" the ad in a strong way (score of 2), I find it interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (3). The ad isn't particularly eye-catching or attractive to me (score of 2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm outgoing and sociable, I'm always looking for ways to improve my appearance and energy levels. This ad speaks to those desires. So, I'd definitely intend to purchase this product (1) and likely try it out (1). However, I wouldn't immediately commit to buying it without more information about the product itself (score of 2).
