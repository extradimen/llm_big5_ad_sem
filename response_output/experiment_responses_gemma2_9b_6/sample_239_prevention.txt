**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses simple language and a relatable concern (feeling tired/dull), it doesn't grab my attention strongly. I find it interesting enough to consider, but not particularly good or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product because it plays on a potential worry. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it.  I would likely try it after seeing more information or testimonials.
