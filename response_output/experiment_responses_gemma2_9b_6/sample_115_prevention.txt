**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, its claims feel a bit exaggerated. The "tired and dull" language is a common tactic to evoke worry, which aligns with my tendency to worry. However, I'm not convinced it's that simple. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because I am generally helpful and unselfish. If I believe this drink could genuinely help others feel better, I might be more inclined to purchase it.   However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from real people.
