**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product, and I might even try it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My worry-prone nature might make me hesitant without further research or reviews.
