**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The scare tactic of "feeling tired and looking dull" feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try this product because I worry a lot about how I appear (as reflected in my personality traits) and the ad plays on that anxiety. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately, nor would I consider it my first choice for addressing tiredness or dullness. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
