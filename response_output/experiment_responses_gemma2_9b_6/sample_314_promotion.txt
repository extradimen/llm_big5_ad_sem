**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing and potentially beneficial (score of 4 for "good"), I wouldn't call it particularly captivating or attractive (score of 2 for "attractive"). It's a decent advertisement that gets its point across effectively.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product (score of 3 for "consider"). I might even be willing to give it a shot (score of 2 for "try"). However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it outright based solely on this advertisement (score of 1 for "intend"). More information about the product's ingredients, taste, and potential health benefits would influence my decision.
