**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit generic and superficial. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product due to my sociable nature and desire for things that might improve my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further information about its ingredients or effectiveness. The worry I feel about making good choices (due to my tendency to be careless) means I'd consider other options before committing fully.
