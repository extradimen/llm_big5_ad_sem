}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (1). The "prevention" angle of the ad is  somewhat intriguing (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (1) due to the potential health benefit. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it (1) without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would likely consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. 


**My reasoning is influenced by:**

* **"Helpful and unselfish with others":** I want to be healthy, but my primary concern isn't looking "dull".
* **"Generally trusting" & "sometimes rude":**  While the ad claims a benefit, I'd need more evidence before believing it outright. My "rudeness" might make me skeptical of marketing tactics.
* **"Active imagination" & "few artistic interests":** The ad plays on basic desires for appearance and energy, which don't strongly resonate with my personality.
