**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product due to the fear-based appeal ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or consider it a regular part of my routine. My general distrustfulness and tendency to be careless about trying new things would likely hold me back.
