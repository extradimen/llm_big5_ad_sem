**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message clear and appealing (good), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing phrases ("stay energized," "look your best").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my financial situation and preference for practical products, I am likely to purchase this drink.  I wouldn't just try it out though; I'd want to see more information about its ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
