**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly captivating ("like" or "attractive"), it does pique my curiosity ("interesting") and seems well-made ("good").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying the product ("intend to purchase," "try") as I'm always looking for ways to feel energized. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
