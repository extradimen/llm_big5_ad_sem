**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The message feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the ad raises a concern (feeling tired/dull) that I might relate to. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or commit to purchasing without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from people similar to me.
