**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make a strong emotional connection.  I tend to be skeptical of claims like this, so "good" feels a bit generous. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm generally trusting but also sometimes rude, I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. The ad plays on my worry about looking dull, but I need more convincing than just that.  If a friend recommended it or I saw some positive reviews, I might consider buying it.
