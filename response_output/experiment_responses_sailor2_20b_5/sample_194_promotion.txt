**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Evaluation:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 3):** The focus on energy and appearance resonates somewhat but lacks personal connection.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4):** It's engaging to see the benefits, but it doesn't capture my imagination fully due to its generic nature.
   - **Good (Score: 5):** The messaging is clear and beneficial; however, I think it could be more compelling with a deeper narrative or unique angle.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2):** While aesthetically pleasing, the ad doesn't evoke strong attraction because of its cliché promises.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 4):** I'm moderately inclined due to practical benefits but not enough to make a firm commitment.
   - **Will try it (Score: 4):** There's curiosity, especially considering the energetic boost and appearance claims which align with daily goals.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 6):** The persuasive elements are strong enough that I'll keep this product in mind as an option for future purchase decisions.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s content and find it reasonable, its effectiveness is slightly tempered by my personal preferences and skepticism toward general wellness claims. However, the product's potential benefits prompt a favorable consideration.
