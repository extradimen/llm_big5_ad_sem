### Evaluation:

**Ad Attitude:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral — While not particularly drawn in, it doesn't feel off-putting either.
2. **Interesting:** Agree — The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to someone my age balancing work/study commitments.
3. **Good:** Strongly Agree — It’s straightforward with clear benefits which resonate well given my need for energy and appearance management.
4. **Attractive:** Agree — The message is visually and emotionally engaging, making it seem credible.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase:** Consider — While the ad effectively communicates benefits, personal budget constraints might delay a full commitment.
2. **Try to buy:** Neutral — I’m open but not compelled enough yet; testing or special offers would sway me further.
3. **Consider buying:** Strongly Agree — The product aligns with my needs and values, so it's on the radar for future consideration.

Overall, though this ad appeals and is well-crafted, practical considerations like budget will influence immediate purchase decisions. However, long-term interest remains high due to its relevance.
