**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score = 3) — While I appreciate energetic and visually appealing ads, it doesn't resonate with my reserved personality.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score = 4) — The promise of staying energized might catch attention briefly but lacks deep engagement for me.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score = 5) — It's well-produced and has positive messaging, though not enough to sway my strong preferences towards authenticity over superficial benefits.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2) — The focus on appearance aligns less with my values; I prioritize health and functionality over looks.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Disagree (Score = 2) — While acknowledging its benefits, personal routines and existing commitments make it unlikely for me.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral (Score = 2) — Curiosity might lead to a trial if accessible but not driven by strong desire.
   - **I will consider buying the product:** Agree (Score = 3) — Open-mindedness towards trying new health/energy products, given time and convenience. 

Overall, while the ad is moderately interesting, it doesn't align strongly with my reserved nature or current needs, hence moderate scores for intention despite a neutral consideration level.
