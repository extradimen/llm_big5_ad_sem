**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Like the Ad (Score: 4)**:
   - I appreciate its direct messaging but find it somewhat standard without strong emotional appeal or creative flair.

2. **Interesting (Score: 3)**:
   - While straightforward, it doesn’t grab my immediate attention; more engaging features could have made it stand out better.

3. **Good Ad (Score: 2)**:
   - It communicates a clear message but lacks depth and persuasive elements to truly impress me as an effective ad.

4. **Attractive (Score: 5)**:
   - Despite reservations, the preventive angle resonates with my cautious nature; it's visually appealing enough not to be off-putting.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: 2
   - The direct link between avoiding fatigue and dullness is compelling but not strong enough for immediate purchase intent.
   
2. **Will Try to Buy**: 3 
   - It's a low-cost impulse item, so I might consider trying it based on its clear benefits.

3. **Will Consider Buying**: 4
   - The ad does encourage consideration, especially given the affordable price range and potential for energy boost during work hours as a civil servant.
   
In summary, while the advertisement has some effectiveness due to its focused messaging, there’s room for improvement in creativity and emotional engagement. Nevertheless, my intention leans towards considering purchasing it primarily because of practical value rather than being deeply influenced by the ad itself.
