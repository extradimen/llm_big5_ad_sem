**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)**  
   While I appreciate its directness and focus on benefits, it doesn't resonate strongly with my personality or daily experience.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)**  
   The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging for me given my varied interests.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 2)**  
   It effectively communicates its point, but lacks persuasive power due to a generic approach and relevance to my lifestyle.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 1)**  
   The attractiveness is low; it feels overly promotional without adding emotional appeal or personal connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)**  
   I'm not inclined to make a purchase based solely on this ad, as my current habits and routine don't align well with the implied need for constant energy boosts.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 1)**  
   Low likelihood of making an effort to buy it; other factors would need to influence me more significantly.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 2)**  
   Although I'm open-minded, the ad doesn't motivate a serious consideration due to its generic nature and my personal preferences for less conventional health solutions or routines. 

Overall, while acknowledging its functional benefits, I remain unimpressed by the advertisement's presentation and thus have minimal intention towards purchasing based on these scores.
