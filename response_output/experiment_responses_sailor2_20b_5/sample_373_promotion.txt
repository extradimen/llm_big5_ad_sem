**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.*: Neutral (3) - The message resonates somewhat but not strongly enough.
   - *Interesting*: Agree (4) - It captures attention with its promise of energy and appearance benefits, which are relevant daily concerns for a young professional.
   - *Good Advertisement*: Disagree (2) - While appealing in concept, the execution feels generic or clich√©d compared to my personal style preferences.
   - *Attractive*: Neutral (3) - The visual appeal might be average; not particularly engaging but not off-putting either.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Considerable but not strong intention (3) - Given the benefits mentioned, it's a rational choice for maintaining daily productivity and appearance.
   - *Will try this product*: Likely to try (5) - The incentive of staying energized aligns with my work needs, so I'm inclined to give it a shot despite some reservations about the ad itself.
   - *Consider buying*: Strongly consider (6) - Despite not being completely sold on the advertisement style, practical benefits make me seriously think about purchasing if affordable and readily available.

Overall, while there's skepticism regarding the presentation and branding, the core value proposition is compelling enough to drive a strong consideration for purchase. Balance between critical analysis of ads and potential utility guides my responses here.
