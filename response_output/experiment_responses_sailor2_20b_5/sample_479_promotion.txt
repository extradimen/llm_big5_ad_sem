**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **Like:** Neutral leaning slightly positive due to my generally practical outlook.
    *Score: 3*
  - **Interesting:** It doesn't grab my attention much given my lack of interest in flashy marketing claims and being somewhat reserved.
    *Score: 2*
  - **Good:** Feels adequate but not compelling, lacking a strong hook for someone with minimal artistic interests.
    *Score: 3*
  - **Attractive:** Unattractiveness due to concerns about manipulative promises that may not align with realistic benefits (nervous and anxious personality).
    *Score: 1*

- **Purchase intention (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Curiosity and some practical consideration for energy support but no strong push.
    *Score: 4*
  - **Try to buy:** Willing to give it a try due to its potential benefits, though not with high enthusiasm.
    *Score: 4*
  - **Consider buying:** I'm open-minded enough to consider the product given my lifestyle needs, but without strong emotional connection or urgency.
    *Score: 5*

Overall, while the ad doesn't deeply resonate, it still holds a modicum of appeal and relevance for someone like me seeking everyday energy improvement. However, trust issues and cautious nature keep the scores moderate rather than high.
