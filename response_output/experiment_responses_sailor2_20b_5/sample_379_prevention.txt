**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like the Ad (Score: 4)*: The statement is clear and relevant for my age group but may lack emotional connection.
   - *Interesting (Score: 5)*: It piques interest with a potential benefit of avoiding tiredness, appealing to personal well-being concerns.
   - *Good Advertisement (Score: 6)*: The message aligns with preventing common issues like fatigue and maintaining appearance; therefore, I find it effective but not overwhelmingly persuasive.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: While visually attractive features could enhance the appeal, the current presentation feels adequate yet straightforward.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: At this moment, there's no strong urge due to existing routines and budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income). However, openness exists.
   - *Try to Buy*: With a "do thorough job" attitude, trying the product aligns with my practical nature; I'm willing to give it a shot for potential benefits.
   - *Consider Buying*: Overall, I find this drink worth considering given its claims and alignment with personal health goals. The low price barrier makes consideration more feasible.

Balancing talkativeness (Agree), thoroughness (Strongly Agree), and emotional stability (Agree) drives both the critical evaluation of the ad and a realistic approach to purchasing decisions. Thus, the scores reflect thoughtful engagement rather than instant commitment.
