**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **Like (Score: 3):** While the concept appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, it doesn't strongly resonate due to its generic nature.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4):** The message is intriguing but lacks specific details that would make it stand out in a crowded market.
  - **Good (Score: 5):** It presents positive outcomes like staying energized and looking better, which are aspirational qualities; hence, I find the idea generally good.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** The ad's attractiveness is low for me because it lacks personal connection or compelling evidence to trust its claims.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend (Score: 1):** Without strong appeal and specific benefits, I have no immediate intention to buy.
  - **Try (Score: 1):** Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND), trying this product isn't a priority or cost-effective decision for me.
  - **Consider (Score: 2):** There's minimal interest in considering it since the ad doesn't sufficiently persuade with details relevant to my lifestyle and needs.

In summary, while acknowledging its good intentions, I find the advertisement somewhat unconvincing and not aligned enough with my preferences or circumstances to prompt any significant purchase consideration. The scores reflect a moderate appreciation without compelling me towards action.
