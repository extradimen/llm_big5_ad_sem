**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)**  
   - While not strongly positive due to my reserved nature and slight skepticism, I find it approachable given its promise of energy and good appearance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
   - The idea resonates with a desire for daily motivation but falls short in engagement because of vague claims.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3.5)**  
   - Neutral leaning towards skepticism; lacking specific evidence or trust due to my general distrust, yet I acknowledge its well-intentioned message.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4)**  
   - Visually appealing and catchy but not overwhelmingly so given my preference for more detailed information.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**  
   - Low intention; I need more reassurance about quality, ingredients, or user reviews before making a decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**  
   - A mild inclination but cautious due to my tendency towards thoroughness and mistrust in quick solutions.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1.5)**  
   - Minimal consideration; the ad's appeal is not enough to drive a firm purchase decision, especially with limited financial resources (<15 million VND).

Overall, while I appreciate its marketing strategy, my cautious nature and lack of strong trust in broad claims lead me to rate both attitudes moderately low and show minimal intent to buy. Further details and credible proof would be essential for changing this perspective.
