**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like (3)**: I find the ad somewhat appealing but not strongly so.
    - **Interesting (2)**: It's mildly interesting; however, there could be more engaging elements for me. 
    - **Good (4)**: The claim to energize and look better is believable enough, though it lacks a personal connection or strong emotional appeal.
    - **Attractive (3)**: The ad isn't particularly attractive given my preference for authenticity over glossy marketing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (1)**: Given the modest attitude towards the ad and its practicality vs. cost, I have low intent to purchase right now.
    - **Try (2)**: There's a slight curiosity but not enough motivation to actually give it a try at this moment with my budget constraints.
    - **Consider (2)**: While not highly compelling, if priced affordably and offered in the future, I might consider buying as an occasional treat. My active imagination does intrigue me towards new ideas.

Overall, while aspects of the ad resonate on a functional level, they aren't enough to drive strong purchase intent due to budget limitations and personal preference for more relatable marketing approaches.
