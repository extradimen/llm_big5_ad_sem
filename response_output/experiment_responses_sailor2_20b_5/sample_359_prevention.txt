**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad (Neutral):** The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat but doesn’t immediately grab my attention strongly due to its commonality.
   - **Interesting (Agree):** It’s intriguing, tapping into everyday concerns that everyone faces.
   - **Believe it's Good (Strongly Agree):** I find the messaging clear and relevant for maintaining energy levels and appearance.
   - **Attractive (Disagree):** As a reserved person with lower artistic interests, the visual appeal might not be compelling enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** While convinced of its benefit, I don’t feel an urgent need just from this ad alone; thus, it’s neutral-leaning low.
   - **Try to Buy:** There's a willingness to give the product a try based on the perceived benefits but without strong motivation.
   - **Consider Buying:** Given my budget constraints and cautious nature, consideration is high as I might think about purchasing after further evaluation or promotion.

Overall, while finding value in the ad’s message, personal traits like reservation and careful spending influence lower scores for immediate purchase intent. Still, it’s a product worth considering under suitable circumstances.
