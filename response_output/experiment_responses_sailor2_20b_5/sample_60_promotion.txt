**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score: 2):** Given my tendency towards being less sociable and reserved, I find it neutral rather than likable. The energy boost aspect is appealing but not enough to make me enthusiastic.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3):** While it's somewhat engaging due to its promise of vitality, the broad generalization doesn't hold much novelty for someone my age and background.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4):** The message aligns with staying healthy and looking well, which has some merit. However, it lacks specificity that resonates deeply.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3):** It's visually appealing but not compelling enough to attract me strongly due to my cautious nature.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** As a blue-collar worker with practical priorities, I'm more focused on durable and cost-effective solutions rather than trendy energy drinks. The perceived benefits don't align well with my needs.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** While the idea of trying something new isn't offputting, it's low due to skepticism about quick fixes.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1):** Despite its potential benefits, other alternatives and my budget constraints make it less likely that I'll seriously consider purchasing this specific drink.

Overall, while the ad is not entirely negative, it lacks enough personal relevance or a compelling value proposition to drive strong interest or action from me. My pragmatic approach values substance over hype, which aligns more with cautious consideration than immediate purchase intent.
