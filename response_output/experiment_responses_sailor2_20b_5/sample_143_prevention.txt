**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** (3) Disagree – The wording feels a bit manipulative and oversimplified.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** (4) Neutral to Agree – It captures attention by hinting at fatigue, which can be relatable, but lacks depth or creativity.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** (5) Agree – The message about avoiding tiredness and dull looks has some merit; it addresses a common concern.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** (2) Strongly Disagree – While effective in conveying urgency, its straightforward tone lacks appeal for me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** (6) Agree – The prevention aspect is persuasive; even though I'm critical of the advertisement itself.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** (7) Strongly Agree – Given its focus on improving appearance and energy, there's enough incentive for me to give it a chance.
   - **Will consider buying this product:** (5) Neutral to Agree – Overall interest is high due to practical benefits but not completely sold by the ad presentation.

In summary, while I appreciate the functional message of preventing tiredness and dull looks, my reservations about the advertisement's style impact how much I like or find it attractive. However, its clear appeal to a common issue drives me towards considering and even actively trying out the product.
