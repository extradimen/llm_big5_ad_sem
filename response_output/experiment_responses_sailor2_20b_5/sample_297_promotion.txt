   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) – Despite its benefits, I feel it might be too generic or clichéd for my taste.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral leaning toward 2 (Low). Although the concept is appealing, there are many alternatives available in the market.
   - **Try to Buy:** Considerable Interest (3) – I'm open to trying it if offered as part of a variety pack or with special discounts.
   - **Consider Buying:** Moderate (4) – The product could fit into my routine after seeing positive reviews and perhaps personal experience.
