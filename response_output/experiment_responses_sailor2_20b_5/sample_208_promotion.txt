**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (score of 3) — The ad's presentation is neither compelling nor off-putting to me.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (score of 4) — It grabs my attention and seems relevant, though not exceptionally engaging.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (score of 5) — I appreciate the message about staying energized and looking good; it resonates with maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
   - **Attractive**: Neutral (score of 3) — While the concept is appealing, the overall presentation doesn't strongly captivate me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree (score of 2) — I don’t have immediate plans or strong motivation to buy it based solely on this ad.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral (score of 3) — There's a mild curiosity but no pressing need; might consider trying if given more context or discounts.
   - **Consider Buying**: Neutral (score of 3) — The product aligns with my lifestyle goals, making it something I'd keep in mind for future purchases.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively conveys positive benefits, its persuasive power is moderate. Although I find aspects appealing and believe the ad itself is good, there's not enough compelling reason to make an immediate purchase decision due to other factors like budget constraints or prior experiences with similar products.
