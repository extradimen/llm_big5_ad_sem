**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (4): Neutral, as it's not particularly appealing but doesn't repel me either.
   - Interesting (5): Agree. It conveys a clear message about energy and appearance which is engaging.
   - Good (6): Strongly Agree. The promise of staying energized aligns with my daily needs and the positive outlook on looking good resonates well.
   - Attractive (3): Disagree. Despite its content, the overall visual or appeal isn't strong enough to draw me in personally.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (2): Disagree. While acknowledging it could be beneficial, my current financial situation and priorities donâ€™t support regular expenditure on such products.
   - Will try to buy the product (2): Disagree. There's no compelling reason for a trial given other budget constraints and alternatives available.
   - Consider buying the product (1): Strongly Disagree. Given limited income (< 15,000,000 VND) and lack of urgent need, I don't see this as a priority purchase.

In summary, while finding aspects of the ad interesting and useful, practical considerations outweigh any attraction or interest in making an actual purchase at present.
