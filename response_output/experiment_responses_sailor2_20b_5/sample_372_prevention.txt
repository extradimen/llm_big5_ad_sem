   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (4): Agree; It captures attention with clear, pertinent concerns.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (5): Strongly Agree; Relatable message linking drink to energy levels feels credible and effective.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (4): Agree; While not overly compelling, it’s engaging enough for consideration.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (5): Strongly Agree; The persuasive message aligns with managing fatigue, a common concern.
