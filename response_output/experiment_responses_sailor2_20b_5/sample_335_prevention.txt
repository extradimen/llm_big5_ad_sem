**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (6/7):** The language resonates with my desire for energy and vitality but feels slightly exaggerated.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** It captures attention by highlighting a common problem, making it intriguing enough to engage.
   - **Good (4.5/7):** While informative, the emotional appeal is strong; however, scientific credibility or proof could enhance its effectiveness further.
   - **Attractive (3.5/7):** The message is visually appealing but lacks depth and might come off as manipulative for some individuals like me who appreciate thorough information.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Despite the persuasive tone, I'm not convinced enough by this single ad alone.
   - **Try Buying:** Curiosity peaks moderately; it may push me towards a trial if offered in conjunction with credible testimonials or science-backed claims.
   - **Consider Buying:** The overall impact is positive but cautious. Additional information and personal need will influence my final decision.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively communicates urgency and relevance, its persuasiveness could be strengthened by more substantiated support to align better with someone who values thoroughness and credibility like myself (age >60, postgraduate student). The scores reflect an appreciative but cautious stance towards purchasing.
