**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad:**  
  Disagree (Neutral leaning towards slightly disagreeable). The direct and somewhat exaggerated claim feels a bit forced for someone who values authenticity.
   - Score: 3

- **I think the ad is interesting:**  
  Agree. It grabs attention with its clear message but could use more creativity to fully captivate.
   - Score: 4

- **I believe the ad is good:**  
  Neutral leaning towards agreeable due to clarity and directness, although it lacks emotional appeal for my taste.
   - Score: 5

- **I find the ad attractive:**  
  Agree. The simplicity helps in getting the point across quickly but falls short on visual or imaginative engagement.
   - Score: 4

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:**  
  Disagree (Neutral leaning towards low intention). While I appreciate preventive health concepts, other factors like personal habits and budget weigh more heavily.
   - Score: 2

- **I will try to buy this product:**  
  Strongly Disagree. Given my current spending limits and cautious approach toward new products without strong evidence, trying it seems unlikely.
   - Score: 1

- **I will consider buying this product:**  
  Agree (Neutral leaning towards consideration). Although not highly motivated, the idea aligns with general health benefits; thus, I might ponder purchasing in future favorable circumstances.
   - Score: 2

Overall, while finding aspects of the ad satisfactory, my cautious nature and budget constraints lower the likelihood of immediate purchase. However, it remains on a list for potential consideration later.
