**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)** - While the idea of staying energized is appealing, my cautious nature and strong disagreement with trusting advertisements mean I don't strongly connect emotionally to this promo.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 2)** - The concept isn't particularly intriguing given my preferences; more practical details would make it more compelling.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)** - Neutral leaning towards agreement, as energy and appearance are important, but lacks the depth to fully convince me of its credibility.

- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)** - Moderately attractive; appealing visuals might draw attention, but not enough to compel strong engagement or trust.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)** - While there is some interest in personal well-being, my tendency towards carelessness and lack of thorough planning reduce the likelihood of a deliberate buy.

- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)** - Low motivation due to skepticism about ad claims and not feeling an urgent need or strong recommendation from peers/family.

- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3)** - There's room for consideration, especially if the price fits within my budget (26â€“35 million VND), but a more compelling reason would be needed to turn potential into action.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance, I remain cautious and neutral-to-negative about purchasing based on this ad. Practical evidence or recommendations from trusted sources might tip the scales positively.
