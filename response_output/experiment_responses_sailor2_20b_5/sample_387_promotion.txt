**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - While I appreciate energy and wellness products in general, my reserved nature means I don't find ads overly appealing without a personal connection.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Agree (Score: 4)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with daily responsibilities, but the emphasis on "looking best" feels superficial given my modesty and practical outlook.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score: 5)
   - On a functional level, it's positive to feel more energetic; however, the broader concept of looking your best seems somewhat irrelevant for me personally.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - The overt focus on appearance doesn't align with my values or lifestyle as a civil servant balancing work and family commitments.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and practical nature, I prioritize essential needs over potentially unnecessary extras like energy drinks.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - Without a compelling reason or significant discount, there's no incentive for me to make an effort towards purchasing it.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral/Consider (Score: 2)
   - Though I won't actively pursue the purchase, if presented with a good deal or during periods of high stress, I might reconsider as long-term health and energy are important.
   
Overall, while recognizing its benefits, my personality traits favor caution and practicality over flashy marketing promises. Hence, although neutral to slightly positive in attitude, there's minimal intent to buy without further compelling circumstances.
