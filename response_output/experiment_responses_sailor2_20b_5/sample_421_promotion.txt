**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (score 3)**: As a talkative and outgoing individual, the energy aspect might appeal to me slightly, but it doesn't resonate strongly.
   - **Interesting (score 4)**: The promise of staying energized intrigues my active imagination, so I find it moderately interesting.
   - **Good (score 5)**: Neutral on helpfulness; while useful claims are appealing, they need more trust and credibility to fully endorse this score.
   - **Attractive (score 2)**: Despite being talkative, the general look-and-feel of typical health drink ads doesn't strongly attract me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Given my cautious nature (Strongly Agree on carelessness and Neutral trust), I wouldnâ€™t commit fully.
   - **Try to Buy**: The idea of giving it a chance is reasonable, but not urgent due to other priorities.
   - **Consider Buying**: There's some consideration driven by the energy aspect relevance for student life, yet external factors like budget (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) and skepticism weigh against strong intent.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad intriguing and moderately appealing, my tendency towards caution, limited financial means, and preference for practicality over marketing promises lower both attitude scores and purchase intentions.
