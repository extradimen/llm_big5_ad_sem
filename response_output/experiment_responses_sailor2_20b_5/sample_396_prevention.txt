**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 4)  
   While not strongly disagreeing, I find it somewhat engaging given its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3)  
   The claim connects to common concerns but lacks unique creativity or emotional appeal for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 2)  
   It’s effective in its simplicity, focusing on a universal issue, yet it doesn’t stand out among similar ads.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 1)  
   The presentation feels standard and lacks visual or emotional allure that would capture my attention.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2)  
   Although I understand its value proposition, there's not enough compelling evidence for me to commit fully.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)  
   Curiosity is minimal; the ad doesn't drive a strong impulse or immediate trial desire.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1)  
   The advertisement might warrant consideration if I'm already in need of refreshment, but it's not decisive on its own.

In summary, while acknowledging that addressing tiredness and dull appearance is valid, the ad doesn't sufficiently align with my personality traits or elevate enough interest to lead to a purchase decision. It lands as moderately acceptable rather than compelling.
