**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score=4):** While talkative and sociable by nature, I find the straightforward message somewhat compelling but not particularly engaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score=5):** The focus on fatigue and dullness resonates with my active imagination; it’s an intriguing concept to avoid looking unenergetic.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score=3):** Neutral, as the claim feels a bit generic without concrete evidence or specific benefits that align strongly with my preferences.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score=2):** The appeal isn't strong enough given other priorities and skepticism about its effectiveness.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score=2):** Despite finding it interesting, personal experiences and trust issues make me hesitant without additional proof.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score=1):** Not inclined due to a combination of being generally unhelpful/unselfish with trial purchases unless compelled by strong incentives or reviews.
3. **I will consider buying the product (score=2):** Given my thorough planning and active imagination, I might ponder it further but don’t see an immediate impulse buy.

Overall, while intrigued, I maintain a cautious approach due to skepticism and existing habits. The ad’s appeal is moderate without strong motivation to act on it right away.
