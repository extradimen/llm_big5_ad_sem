**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
- **I like the ad (2):**
  - As a reserved individual who strongly disagrees with being talkative and outgoing, I find the energetic tone of this prevention-focused advertisement somewhat at odds with my personality. Hence, it doesn't resonate well.

- **I think the ad is interesting (3):** 
  - The message about feeling tired and looking dull might capture some attention because of its relatability to daily fatigue, but it's not particularly engaging given my preference for more straightforward information delivery.
  
- **I believe the ad is good (2):**
  - While preventing fatigue could be beneficial, the claim feels slightly exaggerated. Given my skepticism ("Strongly Disagree" on generally trusting), I'm cautious about its effectiveness without concrete evidence.

- **I find the ad attractive (1):**
  - The appeal of the ad doesn't align with my reserved nature and lack of emotional stability; it comes off as too hyped for a civil servant's practical mindset.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (1):** 
  - Given my strong agreement on being careless, I'm unlikely to be proactive in making significant purchasing decisions based solely on such an ad.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (2):**
  - Slightly more curious but still not convinced; the moderate score reflects a mild interest without immediate action.

- **I will consider buying this product (3):**
  - Despite skepticism, it's within my range of consideration. The health benefits mentioned might be revisited if other factors align (e.g., recommendations from others).

In summary, while I acknowledge some potential relevance to fatigue prevention, the ad fails to resonate deeply due to its presentation style and personal traits, resulting in a moderate-to-low intent score for purchase.
