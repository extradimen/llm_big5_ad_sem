**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **Like the ad (Score = 2):** Given my reserved nature and tendency to find plans lacking thoroughness (Strongly Disagree), I don't connect with ads that promise quick fixes without evidence.
- **Interesting (Score = 3):** It piques curiosity slightly, but not enough to be engaging due to its vague claims about tiredness and dull appearance.
- **Good ad (Score = 4):** Neutral on this point; it's generic health product advertising which doesn't feel particularly well-executed or compelling from my perspective.
- **Attractive (Score = 2):** As a reserved individual, I find the message unconvincing and not visually appealing enough to stand out.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. Given my cautious nature and lack of trust in quick remedies without solid proof, there's no intention.
- **Try to buy this product (Score = 1):** Agree with the strong version; I won't take a chance on unproven products out of habit.
- **Consider buying this product (Score = 2):** Neutral. It might be considered if presented with substantial evidence or by someone trustworthy, but not likely based on this ad alone.

Overall, while acknowledging it's part of the marketing strategy to highlight potential issues, my reserved and thorough nature steer me away from high purchase intention driven solely by such generic ads. Thus, critical evaluation leads to low scores for both attitude and purchase intent.
