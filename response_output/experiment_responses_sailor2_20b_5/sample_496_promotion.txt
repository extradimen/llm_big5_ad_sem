**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) - As a blue-collar worker with modest income, I appreciate practicality over flashy ads.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (3) - The general message feels generic without specific value propositions that resonate personally.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Disagree (2) - It lacks detailed information and credibility about its claimed benefits.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (3) - Minimal visual appeal or emotional connection for someone more focused on utility.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - The lack of compelling evidence and relevance to my daily concerns makes it unappealing.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - No urgency or motivation from the ad, given my cautious spending habits.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree (2) - Although not a complete no-go, current priorities and skepticism prevent serious consideration.

Overall, while I recognize it's possible for products to meet their claims, this advertisement falls short in persuading someone with my profile to prioritize or even contemplate purchasing the drink over more practical needs. Credibility, specificity, and alignment with personal values are crucial missing elements here.
