**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** While not strongly disagreeing (considering my sociable nature), I find it a bit generic and unoriginal; thus, a score of **5**.
2. **Interesting:** The message seems straightforward but lacks creativity or novelty, so **4**.
3. **Believe it's good:** The claim is somewhat persuasive for health concerns, yet the overall presentation falls short; **3**.
4. **Attractive:** Given my preference for more imaginative and engaging ads, this one feels uninspired, hence a **2**.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase:** Even if I feel tired, the ad's appeal isn't strong enough for an immediate purchase decision; **3**.
2. **Will try to buy:** There is no compelling reason or emotional connection driving me towards trying this product right away; **2**.
3. **Consider buying:** Although open to potential benefits, my cautious and analytical nature means I'll need further information before seriously considering it; **1**.

Overall, the ad appeals modestly but falls short in engaging a seasoned office worker like myself with specific tastes and values, leaning towards practicality over emotional or imaginative hooks.
