**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - While not strongly positive (`3-4/7`), there is a moderate appreciation for its functional promise of energy and appearance benefits, aligning with my preference for practical solutions.
   
2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - The product resonates moderately well due to my need for everyday energy support and maintaining an image (especially important in social interactions). However, given the cost constraints (`<15,000,000 VND`) and other budget priorities as a blue-collar worker, I am cautiously optimistic.
   - **Consideration score is higher** because it addresses both practical needs and personal appearance concerns. Though not an immediate buy due to financial limitations, I would definitely give the product serious thought if affordability improves.

In summary, while the advertisement appeals on some levels (`moderate like, interestingness, goodness, attractiveness`), my purchase intention falls into a considerate-but-moderately-intended range based on practicality and current budget constraints.
