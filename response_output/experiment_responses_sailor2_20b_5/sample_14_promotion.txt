**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - While I appreciate energy and wellness products, my tendency to be strongly talkative might make me indifferent rather than liking it outright.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - The promise of staying energized has some appeal, but it doesn't spark strong interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - It presents a functional benefit, which aligns with practicality; hence I find it generally reasonable and potentially well-intentioned.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - My reserved nature means I'm not particularly drawn to its visuals or messaging style.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Despite my strong agreement on being helpful and unselfish, personal budget constraints (<15 million VND monthly income) make a deliberate purchase unlikely.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) - Slightly higher than intention due to an interest in staying energized; however, financial restraint limits my immediate willingness.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3) - While not a high priority now, the benefits may prompt me to revisit if circumstances change or I have disposable income available later.

In summary, while there are aspects of the ad that resonate due to its practical appeal and personal health goals, my overall attitude is moderately positive but cautious, influenced heavily by financial constraints. Consequently, direct purchase intent remains low despite some consideration for future possibilities.
