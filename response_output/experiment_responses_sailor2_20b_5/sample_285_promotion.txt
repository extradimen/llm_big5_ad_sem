**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad*: Neutral (`3`), as my reserved and sometimes rude nature doesn't naturally gravitate toward overly friendly ads.
   - *Interesting*: Slight agreement (`4`) due to its energetic theme resonating with staying active, yet not overwhelmingly compelling for someone who prefers a balanced lifestyle.
   - *Good*: Moderate agree (`5`). The health and appearance benefits align well with practical needs but lack emotional depth or novelty that would strongly engage me.
   - *Attractive*: Slight disagreement (`2`), as the overtly positive messaging feels somewhat manipulative, which I find off-putting given my reserved personality.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Neutral (`3`). The product's benefits are appealing but not compelling enough on their own.
   - *Try to buy* (consider trial usage): Slight agreement (`4`), driven by curiosity and practicality, especially if it aligns with my daily routine of staying energized.
   - *Consider buying*: Moderate agree (`5`). While I’m not swayed emotionally, the health-conscious benefits fit within my rational decision-making process.

Overall, there's a pragmatic balance between interest and skepticism—enough to consider but not an immediate purchase trigger.
