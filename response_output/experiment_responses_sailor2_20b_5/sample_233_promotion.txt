**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4) - Neutral to slightly positive; given my reserved nature and practical outlook.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 5) - Agreed, as it focuses on energy and appearance—topics that are relevant but not overly enticing for me personally.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 6) - Moderately positive; it presents clear benefits, though I remain cautious about claims without deeper credibility.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 3) - Slightly agreeable due to moderate visual appeal and messaging.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2) - Low agreement; my reserved attitude, financial considerations (<15 million VND monthly), and general tendency towards practicality make me less inclined.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3) – Neutral-to-positive; if it aligns with budget constraints after further research, I might give it a trial run.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4) – Slight inclination towards consideration; the health and appearance benefits are somewhat appealing but not decisive on their own.

In summary:
- **Ad Attitude**: Somewhat positive but restrained by my reserved nature and cautious approach.
- **Purchase Intention**: Mild interest with a leaning toward thoughtful evaluation before deciding to buy.
