**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like the Ad*: Neutral – The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, but it's not overwhelmingly exciting given my reserved nature.
  - *Interesting*: Agree – It has a clear message that resonates with maintaining daily performance, which aligns somewhat with work demands.
  - *Believe the Ad is Good*: Disagree – While I appreciate claims of benefits, there’s no strong evidence or personal relevance making me trust this claim wholeheartedly.
  - *Attractive*: Neutral – It's visually appealing but doesn't captivate me intensely.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Disagree – The lack of specific details and a neutral engagement level don’t drive immediate purchase intent.
  - *Try to Buy*: Agree – Given my helpful, unselfish nature and the product's potential benefits, I'm open-minded enough to give it a try if available conveniently.
  - *Consider Buying*: Strongly Agree – Despite some reservations, this aligns with maintaining productivity and personal care, making me seriously consider purchasing.

Overall, while there’s room for improvement in convincing power and credibility, the ad is intriguing enough to prompt consideration due to my balanced personality traits.
