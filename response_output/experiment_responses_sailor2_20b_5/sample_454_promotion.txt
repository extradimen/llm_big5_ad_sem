**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (4/7)**: While I appreciate its message of energy and looking good, it feels slightly out-of-reach for my current lifestyle as a senior civil servant with limited financial resources.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7)**: The concept is engaging but not highly captivating since personal rejuvenation isn't my top priority right now.

- **I believe the ad is good. (5/7)**: It's effectively crafted, and I recognize its appeal to a younger demographic; however, it doesn't perfectly resonate with my current life stage or concerns.

- **I find the ad attractive. (2/7)**: My personality leans towards practicality rather than being visually drawn in by flashy marketing messages alone.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product. (2/7)**: With a budget constraint and prioritizing essential needs, I'm not likely to make an immediate or strong effort to buy it.
  
- **Will try to buy this product. (3/7)**: There's some mild interest due to its health benefits, but external factors like cost will hold me back from actively seeking purchase.

- **Will consider buying the product. (1/7)**: While I acknowledge that staying energized is important, my current financial and personal circumstances mean this consideration remains low on my priority list.

Overall, while the ad conveys a positive message, its relevance to my specific situation as an older civil servant with modest income limits both appeal and purchase intent significantly. Emphasis should be placed more on affordability and practicality for effective engagement in this demographic segment.
