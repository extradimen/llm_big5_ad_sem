**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like (Score = 2):** Neutral-to-disagree as it feels slightly manipulative but not overly persuasive.
  - **Interesting (Score = 3):** Disagrees to some extent; while a bit attention-grabbing, its message doesn't resonate personally.
  - **Good (Score = 4):** Slightly agrees. It seems decently crafted but lacks genuine appeal given my skeptical nature and reserved personality traits.
  - **Attractive (Score = 3):** Neutral-to-disagree; not visually or emotionally compelling enough to draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. Despite understanding fatigue, I'm skeptical about the product's effectiveness and hesitant due to my cautious and untrusting nature.
  - **Try (Score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. No desire or confidence in trying a new drink without solid evidence from trusted sources or personal experience.
  - **Consider (Score = 2):** Agree; might give it slight consideration if pressured by social circumstances, but ultimately low priority due to financial constraints and existing lifestyle routine.

Given my background and traits—practical, careful with finances, emotionally cautious—the ad fails to convert me into a likely buyer despite its claims. The need for tangible proof outweighs the perceived benefit described in the advertisement.
