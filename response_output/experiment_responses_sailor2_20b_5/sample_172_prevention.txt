**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad**: Agreeable but not strongly, as it aligns with my desire to stay energized and presentable.
   - **Interesting**: Neutral leaning toward agree; highlights a common concern relevant to everyday life.
   - **Good**: Strongly believe this type of messaging is effective in promoting health and well-being.
   - **Attractive**: Moderately attractive, appealing as it targets fatigue and appearance concerns but could be enhanced.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Neutral; though the ad resonates, budget constraints (monthly income) weigh heavily.
   - **Try to buy**: Somewhat agree; I may seek a sample or lower-cost alternative if available.
   - **Consider buying**: Agree; overall, it aligns with maintaining personal health and appearance, making it worth considering within my means.

In summary, while the ad is effective in its messaging (4-6), practical considerations like cost impact actual purchasing intent slightly. Thus, a balanced approach of consideration without immediate commitment is taken.
