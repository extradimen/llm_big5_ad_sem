**Evaluation:**

* **Attitude towards the Ad:**
   - **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**: While the concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, it lacks strong personal relevance or emotional connection.
   - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 5)**: The promise of energy and appearance benefits peaks my curiosity; however, I don't find it exceptionally engaging.
   - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 3)**: The message feels generic and not tailored to my specific needs or concerns as a civil servant with high levels of stress.
   - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**: Despite being visually appealing, it doesn't captivate me due to its broad appeal without addressing personal factors like budget constraints.

* **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; my monthly income is limited (<15 million VND), making premium energy drinks a non-priority.
   - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**: Neutral, I might consider it if there were budget-friendly alternatives or significant discounts.
   - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**: Slightly agree; while not actively pursued now, the idea may be revisited during periods when stress is particularly high and other options are exhausted.

Overall, though appreciating its broad messaging appeal, my skepticism towards financial feasibility combined with moderate engagement levels leads to a cautious evaluation of this advertisement. It doesn't strongly resonate or spur immediate action given my current situation and values.
