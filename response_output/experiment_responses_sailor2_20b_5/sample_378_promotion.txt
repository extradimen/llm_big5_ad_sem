**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly agree (score = 3). The claims might seem appealing, but it doesn't strongly resonate.
    - **Interesting**: Somewhat interesting due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits (score = 4).
    - **Believe is good:** Generally believable given my trust level, though not exceptionally compelling (score = 5).
    - **Attractive:** Not very appealing as a whole; more utilitarian than engaging for me (score = 2).

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly disagree (score = 1). Despite the claims, my current situation and priorities don't align with regular purchases like this.
    - **Will try to buy**: Neutral leaning toward a tentative yes (score = 2), acknowledging that it might be worth testing once.
    - **Consider buying**: Somewhat considerate due to needing energy boost but not strongly committed (score = 3).

This evaluation reflects my practical outlook, trust concerns, and cautious approach in spending on non-essential items. Though the ad isn't unappealing entirely, I'm more inclined towards a trial rather than immediate or regular purchase commitment.
