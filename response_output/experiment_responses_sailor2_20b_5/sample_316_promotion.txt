**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 5):** While I appreciate energy drinks for their utility, especially during my busy days as a civil servant, the ad does not strongly resonate with me. It feels somewhat generic.
    - **Interesting (Score: 4):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing but lacks depth or novelty that would captivate me immediately.
    - **Good (Score: 3):** I find it decently crafted, focusing on two positive outcomes—energy and appearance. However, there's not enough compelling detail to make a strong impression.
    - **Attractive (Score: 2):** The overall aesthetic is passable but doesn’t attract me strongly; it could be more engaging visually or with relatable testimonials.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score: 1):** Despite the ad’s message, I’m not inclined to buy based solely on this promotion. Personal preferences and brand loyalty play a significant role.
    - **Try (Score: 2):** There is some curiosity because of my need for energy boosts but no immediate drive to purchase right now.
    - **Consider (Score: 3):** While I won’t rush into buying, the product could be considered if it aligns with future needs and appears reliable after further research or reviews.

In summary, though not entirely unappealing, the ad falls short in compelling me due to its generalized approach. The strong focus on practical benefits is appreciated but lacks personal connection and innovative appeal needed for a high purchase intention from someone like myself who values thoroughness and originality.
