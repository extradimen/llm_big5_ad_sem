**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate its effort to be engaging and positive, it feels slightly superficial given my age group's preferences for more substantive content.
  
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)** - The promise of energy and appearance benefits is appealing but not enough to captivate me fully.

3. **Good (Score: 6)** - It communicates its message effectively; however, I need stronger credibility factors given my cautious nature regarding health claims.

4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - Despite the visual elements, it doesn't strongly attract me due to a lack of deeper connection or personal relevance beyond surface-level benefits.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - I'm not convinced enough by the ad alone and would seek more detailed information before making a decision.
  
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - There's curiosity, but it isn't high enough for an immediate purchase; testing via samples or recommendations might change my mind.

3. **Consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - The idea of staying energized and looking good aligns with some goals, so I'd keep it in the back of my mind as a potential option if additional evidence supports its claims.

Overall, while the ad is not wholly unappealing, it falls short due to my preference for deeper substance over flashy promises. Further details on ingredients, customer testimonials, and perhaps a more relatable narrative would significantly boost engagement and purchase intent.
