**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (score = 3): Neutral to slightly negative because my reserved personality makes me cautious about such claims.
  - The ad is interesting (score = 4): It garners some interest due to its straightforward message, but not significantly engaging for a reserved individual.
  - Believe it's good (score = 5): While neutral leaning positive, I remain skeptical given the lack of specific evidence and personal reservations about health marketing claims.
  - Find it attractive (score = 2): Low attractiveness as my cautious nature makes me wary of hyperbolic benefits.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intent to purchase this product (score = 1): Strongly disagree; I am not inclined due to skepticism and cost constraints.
  - Will try to buy the product (score = 2): Neutral leaning negative, as my financial limitations preclude any spontaneous trial purchases.
  - Consider buying it (score = 3): Somewhat open but unlikely under normal circumstances, given other priorities and cautious approach to new products. 

Overall, while acknowledging its message and initial intrigue, my reserved nature and practical concerns significantly dampen enthusiasm towards the ad or immediate purchase intention.
