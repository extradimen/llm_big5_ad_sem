**Evaluation and Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **Like**: Neutral (3) - Given my strong sociability, I appreciate ads that engage me socially, but the straightforward nature of this ad doesn't immediately spark personal interest.
- **Interesting**: Agree (4) - The concept of staying energized appeals to everyone; hence it catches attention due to its relevance in daily life.
- **Good**: Disagree (2) - While useful, the claim seems somewhat generic and lacks specific evidence or unique selling points I find compelling.
- **Attractive**: Strongly Agree (5) - Its promise aligns with my desire for practical solutions that enhance appearance and energy levels; visually appealing presentation could also add to its attractiveness.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Despite the appeal, given my high monthly income from a blue-collar job, cost-effectiveness is crucial. Without detailed pricing or substantial benefits, I'm not inclined.
- **Try**: Disagree (2) - While interested in the concept, Iâ€™m hesitant without direct experience or endorsements from trusted peers/workmates to justify the purchase.
- **Consider**: Agree (4) - The idea of looking and feeling better daily is appealing. It's worth considering if provided with additional information on ingredients, efficacy studies, user testimonials, or special promotions that align with my budget.

Overall, though the ad resonates well in terms of functionality and attractiveness, a more robust presentation combined with cost transparency would significantly elevate its purchase intention score for me.
