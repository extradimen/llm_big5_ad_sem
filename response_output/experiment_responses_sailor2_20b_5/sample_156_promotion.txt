**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like**: Neutral (3). The messaging is not overly appealing or uninteresting but lands squarely in a comfortable zone.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4). It does present an attractive idea of staying energized and looking good, which could capture attention briefly.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5). For someone health-conscious and valuing personal appearance, the promise of daily benefits is credible and desirable.
   - **Attractive**: Strongly Agree (6). The concept aligns with maintaining vitality and aesthetics, resonating positively.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral leaning towards Disagree (2). While interested, there's no strong drive or urgency to buy immediately due to a variety of other factors like budget constraints.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Consideration level (3). The product is worth considering for its benefits but requires more deliberation before making an impulse purchase.
   - **Consider Buying**: Agree (4). Given the favorable messaging, I acknowledge potential value and may decide to buy eventually if it fits into my lifestyle and financial plan.

In summary, while the ad effectively conveys appealing attributes that align with health-conscious goals, personal habits and current circumstances slightly temper immediate purchasing intent. The overall score reflects a thoughtful but positive consideration of this beverage product.
