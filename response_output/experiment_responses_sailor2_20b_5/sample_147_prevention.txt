**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad**: 
   - *5* (Agree): The ad's direct messaging resonates with my concern about energy and appearance, but it lacks excitement.
   
2. **Interesting**:
   - *6* (Strongly Agree): It addresses real-life issues effectively, making it compelling for someone managing daily stress and responsibilities.

3. **Good Ad**: 
   - *4-5*: While not groundbreaking, the ad presents a clear problem-solution scenario that aligns with my values of self-care without overpromising.
   
4. **Attractive**:
   - *3* (Neutral): The message is solid but could be more engaging visually and emotionally.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase**: 
   - *2-3*: Not a strong intent, as I prioritize brands with proven track records.
   
2. **Try the Product**:
   - *6* (Strongly Agree): Given my proactive attitude toward wellness, I am inclined to give it a try due to its potential benefits.

3. **Consider Buying**: 
   - *6*: My balanced approach values thoroughness; hence, after trying, if results align with expectations, consideration for future purchases is high.

Overall, the ad succeeds in capturing attention but might need stronger emotional appeal or more compelling evidence of efficacy to drive a higher purchase intention.
