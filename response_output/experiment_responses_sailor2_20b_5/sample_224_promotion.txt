**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (2)**: While I am talkative and have an active imagination, which might make me appreciate creative ads to some extent, this energy drink promotion doesn't specifically resonate with my interests or daily needs.
  - **Interesting (3)**: The concept of staying energized is intriguing but not highly engaging given my other priorities.
  - **Good (4)**: It conveys a positive message about health and appearance, which aligns somewhat with general wellness ideals, making it slightly favorable.
  - **Attractive (5)**: Neutral attractiveness due to the balanced yet common promotion strategy.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (6)**: Given my monthly income range of 16,000,000â€“25,000,000 VND and active lifestyle, I might see value in an energy drink despite reservations about marketing tactics.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (7)**: Curiosity from the vivid benefits described encourages me to give it a chance.
  - **Will consider buying this product. (6)**: Even though not strongly motivated by the ad, I'm open-minded and may decide based on reviews or future experiences.

Overall, while slightly critical of its presentation, there is enough interest in trying due to personal wellness concerns and being an informed consumer.
