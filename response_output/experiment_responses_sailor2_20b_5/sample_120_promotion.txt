**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad*: Neutral (4). The claim of staying energized resonates with me, but it's not overly compelling.
   - *I think the ad is interesting*: Agree (5). Promises health and appearance benefits intrigue my practical side.
   - *I believe the ad is good*: Strongly Agree (6). It emphasizes tangible results which aligns well with my focus on daily performance.
   - *I find the ad attractive*: Somewhat Attractive (3). While not visually striking, the message is clear.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product*: Unlikely to Intend (2). My budget-conscious nature and existing routines reduce immediate impulse.
   - *Will try to buy this product*: Mild Interest in Trying (3). Curiosity about its effectiveness could lead me to test it out, especially if affordable.
   - *Will consider buying the product*: Consider Purchasing Based on Benefits (4). The potential for better energy levels and appearance makes it a possible future purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's straightforward message of benefits, my cautious nature and current priorities keep the intent low. However, with more information or discounts, there is room to consider buying this product.
