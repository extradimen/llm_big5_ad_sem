**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad**: 2 (Neutral) — While not unlikable, it doesn't resonate strongly with me given my values and personality.
  - **Interesting**: 3 (Slightly Agree) — The concept of energy and looking good is generic; I find it somewhat interesting but not captivating.
  - **Good Quality Advertisement**: 4 (Agree) — It's a polished ad, but the messaging feels standard for its genre, lacking an emotional connection or unique angle that would strongly engage me.
  - **Attractive**: 3 (Slightly Agree) — The visuals and branding may be well-done, but my reserved nature finds it slightly attractive rather than compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Despite the good ad quality, there isn't a strong desire or urgent need driven by my daily routine.
  - **Try to buy this product**: 2 (Disagree) — I might give it a chance if offered at a sale but not actively seek out the purchase.
  - **Consider buying this product**: 3 (Neutral) — The idea isn't off-putting, so I could consider trying once or as part of varied options in my budget.

Overall, while I appreciate its professional execution, personal preferences and lifestyle factors make me less inclined to pursue a spontaneous purchase. My helpful nature may lead me to try it under the right circumstances but not actively seek it out.
