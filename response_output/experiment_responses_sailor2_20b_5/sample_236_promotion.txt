**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (3)*: Neutral, as while the ad's energy claim resonates somewhat with my lifestyle, it doesn't strongly engage me.
  - *Interesting (2)*: Disagree, because being outgoing and talkative makes more intriguing ads stand out to me, but this one seems generic.
  - *Good (4)*: Agree, I appreciate its straightforward message about staying energized and looking good—relevant for my busy work schedule.
  - *Attractive (2)*: Disagree, the imagery or design isn't particularly appealing given my strong social nature; I crave more dynamic visuals.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase (3)*: Neutral leaning towards consideration. The product's benefits align with what I need but aren’t compelling enough for immediate purchase.
  - *Try (5)*: Neutral, there’s a slight curiosity and willingness to test it out due to its practical appeal.
  - *Consider Buying (4)*: Agree, the balanced view suggests that while not an impulse buy, it's definitely on my radar if I see further evidence or user reviews supporting effectiveness.

Overall, though the ad doesn't fully captivate me, it does address key needs and warrants a thoughtful consideration in future buying decisions.
