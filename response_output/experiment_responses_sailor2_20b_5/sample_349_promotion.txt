**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
  - As a reserved and emotionally stable person who leans towards being careful about personal appearances but doesn't find energy drinks particularly appealing or relevant to my lifestyle, I do not connect with this promotion.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
  - The claim of "staying energized" resonates mildly due to occasional fatigue from work. However, it’s generic and does not excite me enough to be genuinely interested.

- **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 4 (Agree)
  - While I find some value in maintaining energy levels, the overall message seems straightforward but functional rather than exceptional or persuasive for someone like myself who prioritizes practical benefits over flashy promises.

- **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree) 
  - The attractiveness is minimal due to my preference for more tangible and less superficial approaches. As a reserved individual, the emphasis on "looking your best" feels less important than other aspects of well-being or functionality.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
  - Given my financial constraints ($26M–35M VND) and current satisfaction with existing energy sources, there’s little incentive for me to make a switch without compelling evidence of unique benefits.

- **I will try to buy this product:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
  - There's minimal motivation to take the risk or effort needed to test a new drink. My cautious nature and lack of urgency in seeking alternative energy sources makes it unlikely I'll actively seek this purchase.

- **I will consider buying this product:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
  - While not ruling out future interest, particularly if there's a significant change in my work dynamics or performance needs, the current setup does not push me towards considering an immediate buy. It remains on the periphery of my concerns. 

In summary, while I acknowledge practical value in energy drinks, this specific advertisement doesn’t resonate deeply with my values and lifestyle preferences, leading to low attitudes toward it but a neutral consideration for future circumstances.
