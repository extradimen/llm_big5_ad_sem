1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 5)**: Neutral leaning towards positive since the concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to my active lifestyle.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: While it's not highly intriguing, the promise of daily benefits is engaging enough.
   - **Believe the ad is good (Score: 3.5)**: Neutral leaning negative; some skepticism due to generalized claims without specific evidence or details about effectiveness.
   - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: Generally appealing design and messaging, though not compelling for an immediate purchase decision.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2.5)**: Low score due to reservations about making a firm commitment without further research or reviews.
   - **Will try to buy (Score: 3)**: Moderate intent as I'm willing to give it a chance but not driven by urgency.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 3.5)**: Open-mindedness is there; I'll consider this product in my future choices if other factors align.

Overall, the ad resonates with some aspects of my personality and lifestyle goals, yet falls short on providing sufficient credibility to drive a strong purchase intent. Balance between attraction and trust will influence my final decision-making process.
