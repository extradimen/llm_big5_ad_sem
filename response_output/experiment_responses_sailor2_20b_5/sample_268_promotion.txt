**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad (3/7):** Neutral to slightly positive. As a sociable individual who values trust but leans towards being carefree and not deeply invested in health products, I appreciate its upbeat tone.
    - **Interesting (4/7):** Agree. The promise of staying energized resonates with my busy student lifestyle but doesn't captivate me intensely.
    - **Good Ad (2/7):** Disagree. While generally trusting, the ad lacks specific details or evidence to build strong credibility in an already skeptical mindset regarding marketing claims.
    - **Attractive (5/7):** Agree. The visual and energetic appeal is somewhat engaging but falls short of being compelling given my occasional rudeness.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (1/7):** Strongly Disagree. Despite the ad's promises, my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income) make it impractical for me at this time.
    - **Will try to buy this product (2/7):** Neutral leaning towards slightly negative due to budgetary concerns and skepticism about effectiveness without concrete proof or recommendation from reliable sources.
    - **Consider buying the product (2/7):** Neutral. While I may keep it in mind for future consideration, immediate purchase is unlikely given my priorities right now.

In summary, while aspects of the ad are moderately appealing, practicality, financial constraints, and a cautious approach toward health products prevent strong intentions to buy. The score reflects this balanced yet skeptical outlook from someone like me.
