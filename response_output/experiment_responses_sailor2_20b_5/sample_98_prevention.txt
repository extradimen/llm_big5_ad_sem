**Evaluation & Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the ad:** A score of 2 indicates a mild inclination towards liking it, given my reserved nature and strong agreement with thoroughness but neutral sociability.
   - **Interesting:** Scored as 3 because while I appreciate its clear message about fatigue and appearance, I don't find it particularly engaging due to my more practical mindset.
   - **Good quality:** Rated slightly higher at 4 since the ad effectively communicates potential benefits (prevention of tiredness and dull looks), which aligns with preventive health concerns for someone in my demographic.
   - **Attractive:** Another moderate score of 3, reflecting a neutral aesthetic appeal but not strong enough to captivate me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** While I don't strongly intend (scored as 5), the product's preventive nature and my concern for health make it somewhat likely.
   - **Try to buy:** Rated at 6, indicating a high likelihood of attempting to try the drink due to its clear benefits addressing fatigue and appearance concerns which are relevant to daily life stressors.
   - **Consider buying:** With a score of 6, I am very inclined to seriously consider purchasing this product because it resonates with my proactive lifestyle as a civil servant focused on maintaining productivity and well-being.

In summary, while the ad is reasonably appealing (moderate scores), its practical benefits significantly increase purchase consideration. Given my background, values, and personality traits, the preventive message aligns positively enough to drive intent towards trying or buying the product despite not being overly excited by the advertising itself.
