**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (3/7):**
  - Given my reserved nature and strong agreement with doing thorough work but low talkativeness, I find the overall tone somewhat engaging but not particularly endearing.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):**
  - The concept of fatigue prevention resonates at a neutral to positive level. It's relevant for daily life.

- **I believe the ad is good (5/7):**
  - While I don't strongly agree, it’s credible as health claims are believable in this context.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** 
  - My reserved personality and tendency to be careful make me less drawn to flashy or overly persuasive ads.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (1/7):**
  - Strongly disagree; my current budget constraints ($16,000,000–25,000,000 VND) make frequent luxury purchases less feasible.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (2/7):**
  - Slightly agree because I might consider it if presented at a promotional price or as part of occasional indulgences.
   
- **I will consider buying this product (3/7):**
  - Neutral-to-moderate agreement; the ad's message aligns with self-care, but my practicality and careful spending habits mean serious consideration rather than immediate action. 

Overall, while finding the concept valuable, personal traits like reserved nature and financial prudence temper my enthusiasm towards making a purchase.
