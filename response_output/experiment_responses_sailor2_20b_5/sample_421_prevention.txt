**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - *Like*: Neutral (`3`). The ad doesn't evoke strong positive feelings but is generally accepted.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (`4`). It captures attention by addressing fatigue and appearance concerns, which are relatable issues.
  - *Good*: Disagree (`2`). While the message resonates to some extent, it feels a bit overgeneralized or manipulative.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Agree (`5`). The visual appeal and directness make me find the ad attractive despite mixed feelings.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Strongly Disagree (`1`). Despite the message, my current financial constraints (monthly income <15 million VND) and personal focus on studies outweigh any immediate product interest.
  - *Try to buy*: Neutral (`3`). There is some curiosity but not enough urgency or budget for a trial purchase at this moment.
  - *Consider buying*: Agree (`4`). In the future, if my financial situation improves, I might consider trying it based on its persuasive appeal against fatigue and dullness.

Overall, while the ad is attractively presented and somewhat interesting, practical concerns about cost and priorities currently prevent a strong intention to purchase. Nonetheless, an open mind remains for potential future consideration under better circumstances.
