**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **2**: Disagree with liking the ad. The combination of being reserved, sometimes rude, and anxious doesn’t align well with a lively energy boost message.
  - **3 (Neutral)**: While it’s not engaging, the concept of staying energized is somewhat relevant to daily stress management but lacks personal connection or immediate appeal due to my cautious nature.
  - **4**: Agree that the ad presents itself as beneficial ("good"), appealing to someone who values help and new ideas. The promise resonates slightly with wanting improvement without feeling pressured by hype.
  - **3 (Neutral)**: Not particularly attractive given my preference for calmness over energetic visuals or promises.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **2**: Disagree on strong intent due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and the lack of compelling urgency. My tendency towards caution hinders immediate purchase plans.
  - **3 (Neutral)**: Neutral inclination might arise if faced with a sale or special offer but isn't an automatic consideration.
  - **4**: Willing to consider buying as it aligns with my desire for personal improvement, originality, and helpfulness. Despite anxiety, practical benefits may drive eventual decision-making.

Overall, the ad is mildly effective in engaging this demographic due to its functional appeal without being overly persuasive or expensive, leading me to a cautious yet open consideration of purchasing.
