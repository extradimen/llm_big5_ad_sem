**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** (Score = 3) I find it moderately acceptable but not particularly engaging.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2) It lacks novelty and doesn't capture my attention effectively.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4) While functional, it's average in quality and fails to stand out.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 1) This feels unappealing; energetic claims don’t resonate strongly with me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2) Low intention due to lack of strong appeal and personal relevance.
  - **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2) Mild curiosity but not enough motivation for an immediate trial.
  - **I will consider buying it:** (Score = 3) I'm open-minded, so I may think about trying the drink if given more context or a good discount.

In summary, while the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me personally and isn’t very attractive, there's still room for consideration based on practical needs. It’s not compelling enough to drive an immediate purchase decision but remains in my possible choices list under certain conditions.
