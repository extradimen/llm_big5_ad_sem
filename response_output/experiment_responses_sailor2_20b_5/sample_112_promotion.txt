**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Scale 1–7):**
    - *Like*: Neutral towards ads promoting energy and appearance, but not strongly attracted.
        - Score: **3**
    - *Interesting*: Somewhat interesting due to its universal appeal for staying energized, though personal engagement is minimal.
        - Score: **4**
    - *Good*: The message seems generic rather than compelling; lacks depth or relevance specific to my lifestyle and concerns.
        - Score: **5** (Neutral leaning towards slightly positive)
    - *Attractive*: Not particularly appealing given my reserved nature, practical outlook, and lack of emphasis on superficial benefits.
        - Score: **2**

- **Purchase Intention Scores (Scale 1–7):**
    - *Intend to Purchase*: Strongly disagree; the ad doesn't align with my priorities or current needs as a blue-collar worker focused on reliability over glamour.
        - Score: **1**
    - *Try to Buy*: Mild curiosity, but not enough motivation to act due to reservations about its practical value and cost-efficiency for me personally.
        - Score: **2**
    - *Consider Buying*: Slightly higher than outright dismissal, recognizing it might be useful under different circumstances or for social reasons. However, my preference leans towards products offering clear, direct benefits over generalized promises.
        - Score: **3**

Overall, while the ad conveys common aspirational goals (energy and appearance), it doesn't deeply resonate with my reserved personality, practical needs, and high level of self-awareness regarding what truly impacts my day-to-day life. Consequently, purchase intent is low despite a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards its presentation.
