**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: While not strongly negative or positive, I find it somewhat appealing due to its general promises of energy and looking good.
   - **Interesting**: The concept is fairly generic but manages a modest level of intrigue with its focus on daily benefits. Score: 3
   - **Good**: It presents an attractive value proposition but lacks distinctive features that would make me strongly believe in its effectiveness. Score: 5
   - **Attractive**: I find it visually and conceptually acceptable, though not captivating enough to stand out from similar ads. Score: 2

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)**: Given my strong disagreement with being unselfish or trusting, as well as the neutral-to-negative aspects of helpfulness and thoroughness in executing tasks, I have no immediate inclination to buy this product.
   - **Try to Buy**: There's a slight curiosity due to its claims but not enough motivation to actually attempt purchasing. Score: 2
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 3)**: The ad sparks minimal consideration as it aligns with common health and wellness goals, yet lacks compelling evidence or personal relevance that would drive an actual purchase decision.

Overall, the advertisement is moderately acceptable in terms of appeal but falls short in convincing me to take concrete action towards purchasing. My cautious nature combined with the generic nature of its promises contribute to lower scores on both attitudes and intentions.
