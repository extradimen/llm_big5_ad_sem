**Evaluation Details:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like the Ad**: Neutral (3). The energetic and beauty aspect resonates moderately, but it lacks personal appeal due to my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality rather than superficial benefits.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4). It catches attention with its promise of energy boost and looking good—appealing in a general sense.
   - **Believe the Ad is Good**: Strongly Agree (5). The message emphasizes health, which aligns positively with my values of being helpful to others by maintaining personal well-being.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2). While I appreciate its intentions, it doesn't emotionally connect strongly enough for me; this might be due to a preference for more tangible benefits over promises.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend**: Strongly Disagree (1). Despite believing in the product's potential benefits, my practicality and financial constraints ($<15M VND/month) make immediate purchase unlikely.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral (3). There’s a slight curiosity but not enough drive given current priorities and budget limitations.
   - **Consider**: Agree (4). Although I'm cautious with discretionary spending, the idea aligns with healthy habits, making it worth pondering in future financial flexibility.

Overall, while appreciating its messaging and health focus, my reserved nature and pragmatic outlook hinder a strong immediate purchase intent. However, open-mindedness for potential benefits keeps consideration scores moderate to high.
