**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad**: Neutral (3) - While I appreciate its straightforward message, it doesn't strongly engage me.
2. **Think It's Interesting**: Agree (4) - The concept of combating tiredness and dull appearance is intriguing enough to hold my attention briefly.
3. **Believe It's Good**: Strongly Agree (5) - As a student with moderate income, I value energy-boosting products for productivity; hence, the message resonates positively on this front.
4. **Find Attractive**: Disagree (2) - The appeal is limited due to my reserved nature and lack of preference towards overly dramatic or manipulative marketing.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase**: Consider (3) - There's a mild interest, but it doesn't compel an immediate purchase.
2. **Try the Product**: Likely to Try (4) - Given its relevance to my daily needs and strong work ethic ("do thorough job"), I'm inclined to give it a trial run.
3. **Consider Buying**: High Consideration (5) - The idea aligns with maintaining vitality, making it worth considering in future shopping decisions despite not being an immediate priority.

Overall, the ad is effective enough to warrant cautious consideration and possibly testing without triggering strong emotional or impulse reactions due to my personality traits.
