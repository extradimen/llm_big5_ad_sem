**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (Score: 4): Neutral-to-mildly positive. The energy and appearance claims are somewhat appealing.
   - It's interesting (Score: 3): Mildly agree; it has basic appeal but doesn't capture my attention intensely.
   - Good (Score: 5): Agree; it presents a clear benefit, aligning with typical wellness goals, making it seem acceptable but not exceptional.
   - Attractive (Score: 2): Disagree. The presentation feels generic and lacks a strong emotional hook or differentiation for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; despite being mildly positive, the ad doesn’t inspire immediate action.
   - Will try to buy it (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. No compelling reason to take a chance on an unremarkable beverage.
   - Will consider buying it (Score: 2): Mildly agree. It’s not out of consideration completely, but my strong preference for thoroughness and originality means I need more convincing factors like unique features or trusted reviews.

Overall, while the ad is decent in its messaging, it doesn't significantly resonate with my values, preferences, or personality traits enough to drive a purchase intent. A more targeted approach highlighting specific benefits relevant to an energetic yet emotionally stable civil servant might improve effectiveness.
