**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (4/7)**: Neutral leaning towards positive; while not strongly liked, it doesn't turn me off.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (5/7)**: Agreeable since staying energized and looking good are relevant concerns for daily life.
- **I believe the ad is good. (6/7)**: Generally agree because its messaging aligns with modern wellness trends, which resonates well.
- **I find the ad attractive. (3/7)**: Somewhat reserved outlook makes me less inclined to be visually drawn in by typical marketing tactics.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2/7)**: Neutral leaning towards low; my current needs and budget may not prioritize a new energy drink.
- **I will try to buy this product. (2/7)**: Similar sentiment as above, might consider trying it but not actively seeking.
- **I will consider buying the product. (1/7)**: Low likelihood due to existing diet habits and financial constraints; other products already meet my needs.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's message and find parts of it appealing, my reserved nature and practical considerations hinder a strong intention or immediate purchase action. The scores reflect this nuanced evaluation where interest meets personal priorities.
