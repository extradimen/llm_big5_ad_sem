**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Ad Attitude:** 
   - *Like (5)*: The ad appeals to my preference for staying energized and looking good, which aligns with the strong agreement on being helpful and unselfish (valuing self-care).
   - *Interesting (4)*: While not mind-blowing, it's engaging due to its straightforward message targeting energy and appearance.
   - *Good (6)*: The ad is credible and well-presented; I appreciate thoroughness in marketing efforts.
   - *Attractive (7)*: As someone outgoing and sociable who values appearances, the concept of looking your best has a strong appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
   - *Intend to purchase (3)*: Although interested, my hesitation stems from occasional worry about overpromised results in products.
   - *Try to buy (2)*: I'm open to giving it a try due to the clear benefits but not fully committed yet.
   - *Consider buying (4)*: The strong sense of responsibility and trust encourages me to seriously consider this product, especially with its potential for maintaining energy levels.

Overall, while appreciating the ad's message and presentation, my cautious nature means I won't rush into a purchase without further evaluation or trial. However, it leaves a positive impression that could lead to action if convinced by reviews or personal experience.
