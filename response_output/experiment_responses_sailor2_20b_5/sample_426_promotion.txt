**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad (Score: 2)**: Given my reserved nature and sometimes negative interactions with ads, I don't find this particularly engaging.
    - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: The promise of energy boost is somewhat intriguing but lacks a strong emotional hook for me.
    - **Good (Score: 4)**: While it communicates clear benefits, the general appeal isn’t strongly resonant given my focus on thoroughness and originality.
    - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: It's not overly attractive; its simplicity may be seen as lacking in creativity or personal connection.

2. **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: Despite my high income bracket, the generic nature of the claim doesn't motivate me enough.
    - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**: There’s some interest but not strong enough for a dedicated trial based on current information provided in the ad.
    - **Consider buying it (Score: 4)**: It's worth considering, especially if the energy boost is verified and relevant to my lifestyle. However, emotional stability concerns slightly temper enthusiasm.

Overall, while there are aspects that catch attention, the lack of personal connection or compelling differentiation makes this a low-to-moderate score for both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention. I'm open but not actively drawn in by such generic promotional messaging.
