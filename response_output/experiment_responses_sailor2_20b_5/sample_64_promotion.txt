**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score: 4):** Neutral-leaning positive; I appreciate its message on energy and appearance.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3):** Mildly agree, but it's not particularly engaging for me due to my reserved nature.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5):** Agree; it presents a clear benefit that resonates with maintaining vitality throughout the day.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2):** Disagree; while visually appealing, its tone might not strongly resonate given my personality's slight inclination towards practicality over allure.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree. Despite valuing energy and appearance benefits, other priorities and budget constraints make a full commitment unlikely.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** Disagree; the ad's call-to-action doesn't drive immediate trial due to financial limitations (<15,000,000 VND monthly income).
- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3):** Neutral-leaning positive. Itâ€™s on my radar for future considerations when budget allows and aligns with personal goals of staying energized.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message and find it somewhat compelling, practicality and current financial constraints temper my intent to purchase. The advertisement effectively communicates its benefits but falls short in driving an immediate buying decision within my specific context.
