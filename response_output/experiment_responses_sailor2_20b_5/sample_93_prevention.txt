**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my reserved nature and sometimes rude tendencies, I find this emotionally manipulative appeal unappealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 3 (Disagree) 
   - The claim about feeling tired and looking dull isn’t captivating to me; it seems generic without compelling details or novelty.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 4 (Neutral)
   - While not offensive, the message lacks substance that aligns with my more critical perspective on product claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - The presentation doesn’t resonate emotionally or professionally; it feels too focused on superficial appearance rather than genuine benefits.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Despite being an office worker, I don't see the need for immediate action based on a vague ad and my tendency towards thoroughness in decision-making.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score = 2 (Disagree) 
   - There's minimal incentive to take proactive steps; other factors influencing purchase decisions are more important to me at present.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - While open to evaluating the option, my current priorities and concern for authenticity make it unlikely I’ll prioritize based on this advertisement alone.

Overall, although acknowledging potential benefits in theory, the ad's approach fails to connect with me emotionally or logically due to its superficial claims. Consequently, both personal attitudes towards the ad and purchase intentions remain low.
