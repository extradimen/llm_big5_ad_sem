**Explanation:**
1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral, as it doesn't strongly resonate but seems reasonable for its target message.
   - **Interesting:** Agree due to a clear focus on fatigue and appearance enhancement.
   - **Good Ad:** Disagree because while informative, the execution lacks emotional connection or creativity that appeals to me personally.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree as I find it overly simplistic and not visually compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Neutral; considering my cautious nature and tendency for thoroughness, there’s a middle ground—neither strong intent nor immediate refusal.
   - **Try the product:** Agree since trying out new products is part of exploring potential solutions that align with personal needs (avoiding tiredness).
   - **Consider buying:** Somewhat Agree because while I might not rush to buy, the benefits are plausible and worth contemplating if others find it effective. 

Overall, though the ad has a functional appeal, its presentation falls short on emotional engagement for my preferences, impacting both immediate attractiveness and strong purchase intent but leaving room for consideration under specific circumstances.
