**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 4)** - Neutral to slightly agree; it seems functional but not particularly engaging.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 5)** - Agree somewhat because energy and appearance are relevant, yet it lacks a unique hook for me.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 3)** - Neutral with a slight negative bias; promises seem generic without compelling evidence or creativity.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; visual and messaging could be more appealing given my demographics.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; I prioritize practical, budget-friendly products rather than those focusing solely on energy or appearance.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; unless there's a significant reason tied to my needs and affordability, trying it out feels low-priority.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)** - Neutral with a slight lean towards "no"; while the idea is relevant, other factors like cost-effectiveness are more decisive for me.

Overall, although I understand the importance of staying energized and looking good, my current lifestyle and values do not align well enough to be strongly influenced by this ad. Practicality and budget consciousness remain key drivers in my purchasing decisions.
