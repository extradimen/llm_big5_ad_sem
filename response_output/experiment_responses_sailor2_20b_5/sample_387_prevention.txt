**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: Neutral (3)*
   - While it aims to address fatigue and appearance, I'm not particularly drawn in by its tone or presentation.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: Agree (4)*
   - It sparks curiosity about how the drink might help daily performance but doesn't captivate me fully.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: Strongly Agree (5)*
   - The message of preventing tiredness and dull appearance is clear, making it effective at conveying its benefits.

4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: Disagree (2)*
   - The visual appeal or style doesn't resonate with me; I prefer more engaging visuals or a personalized approach.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: Strongly Disagree (1)*
   - Given my reserved nature and careful spending habits, the current evidence isnâ€™t compelling enough for an immediate buy decision.

2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: Disagree (2)* 
   - I'm hesitant due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and a preference for tried-and-tested solutions over new products.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: Neutral (3)*
   - It remains on the radar; if there's an opportunity or additional information showing long-term benefits without significant cost barriers, I might reconsider.

Overall, while recognizing its effectiveness in message delivery, my reserved and cautious personality traits along with financial considerations lead to a neutral-to-negative reaction towards purchasing. The ad is informative but falls short of compelling me as a buyer at this moment.
