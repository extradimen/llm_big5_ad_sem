**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (2/7)** - Given my tendency towards being somewhat reserved and not strongly agreeing with talkative or outgoing traits, I find the ad engaging but wouldn’t say I like it per se.
   
2. **Interesting (3/7)** - The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, so there's an element of interest in how this drink might help.

3. **Good (4/7)** - It conveys a clear message about the product’s benefits but lacks emotional resonance or innovative elements that strongly appeal to me.

4. **Attractive (5/7)** - The ad seems moderately attractive, particularly if it aligns well with my concerns of energy and appearance during work hours as a civil servant.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (3/7)** - While the message is compelling, I'm not immediately convinced to purchase given past experiences in marketing exaggerations.
   
2. **Try (3/7)** - There's some inclination to give it a try if the brand has credibility and reviews support its claims.

3. **Consider (6/7)** - Considering my worries about maintaining energy levels and appearance, I am open to considering this product despite hesitation with immediate purchase intent due to trust issues in advertising.

Overall, while not strongly drawn by the ad, there's a reasonable level of interest combined with cautious consideration. The balance between skepticism and practicality reflects my personality traits and consumer mindset.
