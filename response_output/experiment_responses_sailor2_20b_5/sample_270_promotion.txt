**Evaluation Details:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** Agree (Score = 5) - As a talkative and outgoing person, I appreciate its energetic vibe; however, it's not my absolute favorite.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Strongly Agree (Score = 6) - The promise of energy and looking good resonates with me as someone who values daily productivity and appearance.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score = 4) - While it's effective in highlighting benefits, I'm slightly skeptical about its exaggerated claims without more details on ingredients or efficacy.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Agree (Score = 7) - The visually appealing and energetic presentation appeals to my outgoing nature and desire for self-improvement.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral/Considered Low (Score = 3) - Though I like its appeal, the lack of specific details on sustainability or proven benefits lowers my immediate intent.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree/Maybe Later (Score = 2) - If it's readily available and reasonably priced, I might give it a shot after seeing initial reviews from trusted sources.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral/Consideration (Score = 3) - Given my financial constraints (<15 million VND monthly income), cost effectiveness becomes crucial, so further research is needed before making an informed purchase decision.

Overall, the ad has a positive impact on me but does not prompt an immediate buy. Additional information and trust-building aspects are required to solidify my intent to purchase this product.
