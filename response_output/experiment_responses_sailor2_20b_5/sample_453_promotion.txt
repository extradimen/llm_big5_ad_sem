**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - *I like the ad.* (4): Neutral; The energy and appearance appeal might align with my values but doesn't strongly resonate.
    - *Interesting.* (3): Slightly Agree; Basic claim sounds standard without much novelty for me.
    - *Good Advertisement.* (5): Somewhat Agree; It's professionally crafted, yet the promises feel generic.
    - *Attractive.* (2): Disagree; The visual and messaging do not particularly attract my attention.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
    - *Intend to purchase:* (2) Disagree; While understanding its benefits, I don't have a strong urge due to financial constraints.
    - *Will try to buy:* (1) Strongly Disagree; Given limited income and cautious nature, trying the product isn't high on my priority list.
    - *Consider buying:* (2) Neutral; The option is there but not actively motivating considering other priorities.

Overall, though I appreciate a well-executed ad, its promises donâ€™t significantly align with my lifestyle or immediate needs. Consequently, purchase intentions remain low.
