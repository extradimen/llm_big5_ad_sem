**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2):** Neutral leaning towards dislike. While the ad's message is clear about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it doesn’t resonate personally due to my personality traits.
  - **Interesting (3):** Mildly interesting; the concept aligns with everyday concerns but isn't captivating enough given that I'm more focused on practical tasks than lifestyle drinks.
  - **Good (4):** Generally neutral. The ad is well-constructed, but it doesn’t strongly appeal to my values or lifestyle right now.
  - **Attractive (1):** Strongly disagree; the ad lacks personal relevance and attractiveness given my current focus on work responsibilities rather than beauty products.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree). Despite understanding the benefits, it's not a priority item in my budget or daily routine.
  - **Try to Buy:** Score of 2 (Disagree). While open to trying new things, this particular product doesn't align with immediate needs or motivations.
  - **Consider Buying:** Score of 2 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree). I might give it a thought if there's an urgent need for energy boost but otherwise, my current financial constraints and practical mindset prevent serious consideration.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its message, but it fails to connect deeply with someone like me due to personal priorities, lifestyle factors, and budget limitations. The lack of immediate relevance dampens both liking and purchase intentions significantly.
