**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Disagree (2). As a reserved person, the overtly promotional tone doesn't appeal much.
  - **Interesting:** Neutral (3). The ad concept is somewhat relatable but not particularly engaging for my personality type.
  - **Good:** Slightly Agree (4). It's straightforward and addresses common concerns; however, it lacks emotional connection or novelty for me.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1). Lacks the charisma to draw in someone with a reserved nature like mine.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Consider (3). While I acknowledge its benefits, my current priorities and budget may not align.
  - **Try:** Possibly Try (2). The slight hesitation due to personal preferences but might give it a chance if the need arises.
  - **Consider:** Willingness to Consider (4). Despite reservations, the functional claims make me open-minded enough to think about purchasing in specific situations.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad effective and relevant, my reserved nature and cautious approach reduce the immediate appeal, but not entirely dismiss its potential usefulness.
