**Detailed Evaluation:**

1. **Attitudinal Scores:**
   - **Like (3)**: I appreciate the ad's attempt to connect with busy individuals needing energy and a boost in appearance. However, it feels slightly generic.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It captures attention but could be more engaging or creative given my Neutral imagination score; doesn't spark excitement.
   - **Good (5)**: The message is clear about benefits—staying energized and looking good—but lacks compelling details for a strong impression.
   - **Attractive (2)**: While visually appealing, its overemphasis on immediate results feels superficial. Given my Agree reserved nature, it falls short of being truly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (3)**: I might be inclined due to a need for energy boosters but hesitate because alternatives may offer better value or personalization.
   - **Try to buy (4)**: Curiosity peaks enough that a sample or limited-time discount could sway me, aligning with my Strongly Agree thoroughness in trying new products cautiously.
   - **Consider buying (3)**: The product is on the radar but not at the top of priorities given financial constraints (<15 million VND/month). Considering other budget-friendly options would be necessary.

Overall, while I appreciate its intended message and benefits, my reserved nature coupled with practical concerns makes a low-to-moderate purchase intent. The ad needs more depth to fully resonate with someone like me.
