**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (5/7):**
   - As a talkative and outgoing person, I appreciate catchy marketing that aims to energize daily life. However, the appeal is moderate given my practical mindset.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):**
   - It piques curiosity but doesn't stand out due to common energy drink claims in Southeast Asia's bustling market.

3. **I believe the ad is good (3/7):**
   - Neutral because while it may sound persuasive, there are many similar products with better established brands and credibility.

4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):**
   - Low attractiveness due to lacking strong emotional resonance or personal relevance; I value substance over flashy promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1/7):**
   - Strongly disagree. My budget constraints ($< 15,000,000 VND) and skepticism about new brands make it unlikely for me to commit without more evidence of value or discounts.

2. **I will try to buy this product (1/7):**
   - Similarly low because I am cautious with my limited funds; trying a pricey drink feels impractical given cheaper alternatives known to work well enough.

3. **I will consider buying this product (2/7):**
   - Slightly higher but still neutral as occasional consideration might arise if the price is right, there's a promotion, or personal recommendations align better with my needs and budget constraints.

Overall, while I appreciate energetic marketing, practical considerations heavily influence my attitude towards purchasing, leading to modest scores.
