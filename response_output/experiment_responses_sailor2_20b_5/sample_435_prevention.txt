**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (Score: 3) — The ad does not strongly resonate with me due to its straightforward message.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (Score: 4) — It captures my attention, as I value prevention from feeling tired and dull.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (Score: 5) — The messaging is clear and impactful regarding the product’s benefits.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2) — While effective, it lacks an emotional or visual hook that would make me find it attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Consider (Score: 3) — It piques my interest but doesn't drive immediate purchase intent.
   - **Try to Buy:** Agree (Score: 4) — I'm inclined to give the product a try, given its promise of overcoming fatigue and dullness.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Consider (Score: 5) — Despite not feeling strongly drawn by the ad itself, the perceived value justifies considering it seriously. 

Overall, while the advertisement has persuasive elements, my cautious nature and lack of strong emotional engagement result in moderate-to-high consideration for purchase rather than immediate intent.
