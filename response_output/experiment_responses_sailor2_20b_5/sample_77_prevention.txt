**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score 3):** While not strongly negative, I find it moderately appealing due to its straightforward message.
  - **Interesting (Score 4):** The ad is somewhat engaging as it addresses common feelings like tiredness and looking dull. However, it's not exceptionally intriguing for me personally.
  - **Good (Score 2):** It conveys a clear benefit but lacks persuasive power or emotional connection; thus, I'm neutral to slightly negative on its overall quality.
  - **Attractive (Score 3):** The ad is somewhat visually and conceptually appealing, though it doesn’t strongly grab my attention.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score 1):** Given my personality traits of being sometimes rude and not thorough in plans, I don't have a strong intention to buy this product.
  - **Try (Score 2):** There's some mild curiosity, but no compelling reason or urgency to try it right away. It's just slightly above neutral interest.
  - **Consider (Score 1):** While acknowledging the problem addressed, my inclination towards practicality and low emotional response mean I’m unlikely to seriously consider buying this product.

Overall, while there is a modicum of engagement due to relevance, the ad doesn't sufficiently align with my values or lifestyle to drive strong purchase intent.
