**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - I **like** it (score = 5): The overall message resonates with my desire to stay energized and presentable.
  - Find it **interesting** (score = 6): It taps into personal needs, making me engage with the content positively.
  - Believe it's **good** (score = 4): While not entirely convincing, I think the idea aligns well for busy individuals like myself.
  - Consider it **attractive** (score = 5): The visual appeal and promise are appealing but don't overwhelm.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Score = 3 (Neutral/Modest). While interested, my immediate need or budget may not align perfectly with the product.
  - **Will try to buy it:** Score = 3 (Neutral). I might give it a chance if offered at an accessible price point or during promotional periods.
  - **Consider buying it:** Score = 2 (Tendency towards Disagree). Due to financial constraints and cautious spending habits, my likelihood of purchasing is moderate but not high. The ad's appeal doesn't override budgetary considerations fully.

Overall, the advertisement effectively targets some personal aspirations but does not drive a strong purchase intent for me given current circumstances. Balance between interest in benefits and practicality remains key.
