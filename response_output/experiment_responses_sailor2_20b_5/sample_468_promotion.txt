**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) — While not strongly disagreeing, the ad doesn't particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree (4) — It captures attention but isn’t groundbreaking or highly engaging.
   - **Good:** Agree (5) — The message of staying energized and looking best is reasonable for my needs; it feels truthful enough.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — Not visually appealing to me, lacks strong emotional draw.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral (3) — I’m not committed yet but open-minded about the product's potential benefits.
   - **Try:** Somewhat Agree (4) — There’s a mild inclination to give it a try since energy and appearance matter, especially in my work as a civil servant.
   - **Consider:** Agree (5) — Given its relevance, I will consider this product seriously but won’t rush into an immediate purchase decision. 

Overall, while the ad is believable and aligns with some of my needs, it doesn't stir significant enthusiasm or urgency for me to act on buying immediately. However, there's a thoughtful consideration toward giving it a try based on its claims.
