**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *Like*: Given my talkative and outgoing nature, the ad might grab attention momentarily but does not strongly resonate with me (score of 3).
  - *Interesting*: The energetic and beauty aspects align somewhat with common goals but are not compelling enough to captivate deeply (scoring a moderate 4).
  - *Good*: Lacking trust in product claims due to my Strongly Disagree stance on general trust, I find the ad less persuasive (2).
  - *Attractive*: Neutral as it doesn't particularly appeal or repel me significantly.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
  - *Intend*: My reserved nature combined with a tendency toward careful decision-making makes outright purchase intention low (1).
  - *Try*: I'm not inclined to actively seek out the product, but social pressure can sometimes influence casual attempts (2).
  - *Consider*: While it's on my radar due to societal norms or personal goals, there isn't strong motivation to act decisively (Neutral).

Overall, while slightly interested and potentially open to trying, a lack of trust and a preference for thoroughness in decisions lead me toward cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase.
