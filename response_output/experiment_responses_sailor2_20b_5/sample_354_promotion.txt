**Evaluation:**
- **Ad Attitude:** The advertisement resonates moderately with me due to its focus on staying energized. However, I find it somewhat generic and less interesting compared to other promotional content.
  
- **Purchase Intention:** Given my active lifestyle as a blue-collar worker (with postgraduate education), while the product might seem helpful, daily budget constraints and existing routines make an immediate purchase intention low. There's mild curiosity but not enough drive to try or consider it seriously without additional incentives or personal necessity.
