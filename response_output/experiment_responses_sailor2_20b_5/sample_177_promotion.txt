**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: I find it engaging but not overwhelmingly appealing due to its typical energy drink marketing tone.
   - Score: 5

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: It piques my curiosity because of the promise of staying energized and looking good, which are relevant aspects for someone in a managerial position with an active lifestyle.
   - Score: 6

3. **I believe the ad is good**: While it effectively communicates its benefits, there's room to improve on originality or unique selling propositions that could resonate more strongly.
   - Score: 4

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The combination of functional and aesthetic appeal makes it moderately visually appealing but not exceptionally so for me personally.
   - Score: 5

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Although I appreciate its potential benefits, other factors like brand loyalty or existing products in my routine might influence my immediate decision.
   - Score: 3 (Neutral lean towards "might consider")

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There is curiosity driven by the advertisement's promises, but it won't be a spontaneous purchase without additional research or personal need confirmation.
   - Score: 3 (Slightly neutral)

3. **I will consider buying this product**: The ad does encourage consideration as I align with its target audience needs—energized and looking good—but external factors influence final purchase decisions.
   - Score: 2 (Mildly leaning towards considering rather than strongly intending to buy) 

Overall, the advertisement resonates moderately well but leaves room for a more compelling proposition or additional personal relevance before solidifying an immediate buying decision.
