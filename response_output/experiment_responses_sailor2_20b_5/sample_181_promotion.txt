**Evaluation Details:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **Like (6):** I find the ad appealing in a basic sense but not overwhelmingly so.
2. **Interesting (5):** The claim about staying energized and looking your best is engaging; however, it lacks unique or compelling elements to capture my full attention.
3. **Good (4):** While well-structured with clear messaging, there are no standout features that make me strongly believe in its effectiveness.
4. **Attractive (3):** The ad design might not be very visually appealing and could use more creativity to stand out.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend (2):** I am less inclined to immediately purchase due to moderate skepticism about the benefits.
2. **Try (2):** Given my generally cautious approach, trying it once would depend on price and availability in local stores.
3. **Consider (3):** The idea aligns with personal needs for energy boosters, but other factors like brand trust and affordability will heavily influence a final decision.

Overall, while the ad is mildly engaging and reflects some of my lifestyle goals, additional reassurance about product effectiveness and value would be necessary to increase purchase intent.
