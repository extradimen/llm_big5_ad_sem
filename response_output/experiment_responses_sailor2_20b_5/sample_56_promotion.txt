**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — The ad is neither particularly appealing nor unappealing to me due to my reserved nature and careful approach.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — I find it intriguing since staying energized and looking good resonates with general well-being, but not overwhelmingly so.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) — The message aligns with health-conscious values; the claim of daily benefits is believable enough to be viewed positively.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — While I appreciate the content, its visual appeal or presentation style doesn't strongly grab my attention.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Neutral (3) — The ad provides some motivation but not strong enough for an immediate buy decision.
  - **Will try to buy:** Agree (4) — Given the benefits and alignment with personal goals, I am inclined to give it a try if offered at a reasonable price or during special promotions.
  - **Consider buying:** Strongly Agree (5) — The product is definitely on my radar for consideration; potential value in staying energized supports ongoing evaluation.

Overall, while not overly captivating visually, the ad effectively conveys benefits that align with health and wellness goals, leading to moderate-to-high interest and intention towards purchase.
