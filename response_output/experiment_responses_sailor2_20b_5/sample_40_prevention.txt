**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
   - **Like (score=3)**: While not strongly disliking it, I'm neutral; the ad doesn't particularly resonate.
   - **Interesting (score=4)**: It's somewhat interesting but lacks a strong emotional or imaginative appeal for me.
   - **Good (score=5)**: The message is clear and practical, making it decently effective.
   - **Attractive (score=2)**: Given my reserved nature and preference for substance over flashiness, the ad appears more utilitarian than attractive.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to Purchase**: I score this as 1 ("Strongly Disagree") because it doesn't align with my current lifestyle or needs.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: At a moderate level of curiosity (score=2, "Disagree"), the claim is credible but not compelling enough for immediate action.
   - **Consider Buying**: I might think about it under specific conditions (score=3), especially if other factors like health benefits are highlighted elsewhere.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional message, my reserved personality and current lifestyle do not push me towards a strong intent to purchase. However, the product could still be considered in future decisions influenced by additional context or personal needs.
