**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 6)
   - As a talkative and outgoing person who values sociability, I appreciate straightforward messaging that appeals to everyday experiences.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 5)
   - The claim of feeling tired and looking dull resonates with practical concerns but could be more engaging creatively.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4)
   - It effectively identifies a common issue, though it lacks depth or compelling emotional appeal to strongly convince me.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3)
   - While not unattractive, its simplicity makes it somewhat forgettable compared to more creatively designed ads.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2) 
   - The persuasive power is limited given my tendency towards thoroughness and skepticism about health claims without additional evidence or brand trust.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)
   - Low intent due to the lack of strong emotional connection, detail in benefits, or a unique selling proposition that aligns with my preferences.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2) 
   - The mild curiosity and practical relevance may lead me to keep it in mind if I encounter more positive reviews or credible endorsements from others.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in conveying a common issue, its impact on my purchase intention is minimal without significant additional context or compelling features that resonate with my values and lifestyle.
