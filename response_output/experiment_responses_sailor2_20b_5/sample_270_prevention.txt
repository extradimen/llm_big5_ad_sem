**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **I like the ad (Score: 6)**: The message resonates with my concern about feeling tired and looking dull.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: It's attention-grabbing but slightly over-the-top, which might be seen as a bit exaggerated by others. Hence, it falls short of being extremely interesting for me.
  - **Good (Score: 4.5)**: While the ad effectively communicates its purpose, it lacks emotional depth and creativity that would make it outstanding.
  - **Attractive (Score: 3.5)**: The visual or aesthetic appeal could be stronger to draw in a younger demographic like myself.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: I appreciate the concern for energy and appearance, but multiple factors—including budget constraints—detract from my immediate purchasing decision.
  - **Will try to buy (Score: 1.5)**: With limited funds (<15,000,000 VND), trying out this product would stretch my monthly spending too much without a compelling guarantee of noticeable results.
  - **Consider buying (Score: 1.8)**: There's some consideration for future purchase if the price drops or if I see better reviews/proofs about its effectiveness, but it’s not high on my priority list now.

Overall, while the ad addresses common concerns and is moderately engaging, budgetary constraints, skepticism about exaggerated claims, and a preference for more creative ads lower my overall interest in purchasing.
