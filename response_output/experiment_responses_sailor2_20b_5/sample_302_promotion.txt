**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3)**: While the ad mentions health and appearance benefits, which are attractive qualities, my reserved nature means I don't find it particularly engaging.
   - **Interesting (4)**: The concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing to most people; however, as an introvert with a cautious approach, I'm moderately interested but not overly excited by the ad's presentation.
   - **Good (3)**: It covers important aspects that could be beneficial. However, given my tendency towards skepticism (Strongly Disagree on trusting), the lack of specific evidence or deeper details lowers its credibility for me.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Although visually and conceptually appealing to some extent, it doesn't resonate deeply with my reserved and cautious personality.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2)**: Despite liking certain aspects, I'm not driven enough by the ad alone to make a purchase decision. Other factors like reviews or personal needs would still come into play.
   - **Try (1)**: Low score due to my preference for cautiousness and thoroughness in making purchases; without stronger motivations, trying out this product seems unlikely.
   - **Consider (2)**: I may consider it if other sources provide more information or reassurance aligning with my values of helping others stay healthy and presentable.

Overall, while the ad presents a desirable message, my reserved personality and skepticism mean it doesn't strongly influence me to take immediate action. Yet, the idea is not completely dismissed, leaving room for consideration under additional circumstances.
