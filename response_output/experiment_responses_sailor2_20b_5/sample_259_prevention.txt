**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3) — The phrasing is clear but doesn't evoke strong personal connection.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (score = 4) — It’s engaging enough to capture attention briefly.
  - **Good:** Somewhat agree (score = 5) — Adequate in conveying the product's benefits without being compelling.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (score = 2) — The claim feels overused and not visually appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1) — Despite understanding its purpose, the ad doesn't drive a strong desire.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Neutral/Disagree (score = 2) — Minimal curiosity but no firm intention to act immediately.
  - **Consider buying this product:** Agree (score = 3) — Might be considered in future needs or low-hanging scenarios, but not a priority now.

Overall, while the ad is informative and somewhat engaging due to its clear message about preventing fatigue and dullness, it lacks personal relevance and emotional appeal that would drive strong purchase intent for this consumer. Therefore, there’s slight openness to consideration but no immediate impulse to buy.
