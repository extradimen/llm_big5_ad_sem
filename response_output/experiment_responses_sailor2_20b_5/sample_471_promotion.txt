**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** I don't find it particularly appealing given my reserved and non-sociable nature. Hence, a score of 3 (Neutral).
  - **Interesting:** The concept doesn’t resonate strongly with me; thus, a lower score of 2 (Disagree).
  - **Good:** I question the overall effectiveness as per my practicality, scoring it at 1 (Strongly Disagree).
  - **Attractive:** While not overly persuasive, there is a minimal attraction due to its functional promise, leading to an agreeable 4 (Agree).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my financial constraints and prioritization of practical needs over nonessential items, I strongly disagree with buying it at this point—score of 1.
  - **Try to Buy:** Even though the ad makes a claim, distrust and lack of immediate need push me towards disagreement (2).
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral stance; while not ruling out future consideration if circumstances change or there's genuine energy benefit verified, my current needs aren't aligned with this product.

In summary, despite some moderate attractiveness, personal values and financial situation make the ad less compelling for an immediate purchase decision.
