**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
    - **Like (3)**: The ad is somewhat pleasant but doesn't strongly resonate.
    - **Interesting (4)**: It catches my attention to a moderate extent because of its straightforward message.
    - **Good (5)**: I find the concept reasonably sound, focusing on a common fatigue issue.
    - **Attractive (2)**: While not compelling visually or emotionally, it doesn't turn me off completely.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - **Intend to purchase**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) – Despite understanding the message, my current financial situation and high workload make this a low priority.
    - **Try to buy**: 2 (Disagree) – I'm not motivated enough due to existing budget constraints and alternatives available.
    - **Consider buying**: 3 (Neutral) – It's on my radar, but other priorities take precedence.

Overall, the ad addresses fatigue effectively, but it doesn't sway me into immediate or strong purchase intention given my current life circumstances. Practicality outweighs the persuasive message for now.
