**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Agree (Score = 4) - The message is straightforward but does not deeply resonate with my personal values or needs.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral leaning towards Agree (Score = 5) - It piques mild interest due to its directness, though not exceptionally engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Disagree (Score = 3) - While effective in conveying urgency, it feels somewhat manipulative and lacks a compelling narrative or deeper benefits for me personally.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2) - The appeal isn't strong enough; I perceive it as more of a fear-mongering tactic rather than an attractive pitch.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) - Given my current lifestyle and budget priorities, this drink is not a top concern for me.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral leaning towards Try (Score = 2) - There's minimal motivation to give it a shot despite the ad's claims; might consider if prompted by necessity or better offers.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score = 3) - While not high on my list, I wouldn't dismiss it entirely and could potentially reconsider under specific circumstances.

Overall, while understanding its message, the advertisement doesnâ€™t align strongly with my values, preferences, or current needs, leading to a mix of moderate interest but low intention to purchase.
