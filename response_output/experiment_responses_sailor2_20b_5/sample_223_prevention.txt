**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - While I appreciate its straightforward message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, my reserved nature makes me indifferent to overly dramatic or urgent claims.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 4 (Agree)
   - The idea of linking fatigue with a specific product can spark curiosity but doesn't captivate strongly enough given my neutral sociability.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 5 (Strongly Agree, leaning toward Neutral)
   - Although it effectively communicates necessity, its effectiveness for me lies more in clarity rather than emotional appeal. My tendency to question trustworthiness slightly diminishes full belief.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - The message seems functional but lacks personal connection or an appealing creative twist that would catch my attention as a reserved and thoughtful individual.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Despite its claims, the lack of strong emotional resonance or urgency doesn't motivate me to make an immediate purchase decision given my current situation and spending habits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - My inclination towards thoroughness isnâ€™t satisfied by just seeing a convincing ad; I'd need additional information, reviews, or personal experience before trying.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score = 3 (Neutral/Consideration)
   - While the idea is valid and resonates with my health-conscious values, it doesn't compel me instantly but leaves room for consideration if further evidence supports its efficacy in reducing tiredness and improving appearance.
   
Overall, though I understand the ad's utility message, personal preferences like being reserved and a tendency to be untrusting reduce its persuasive impact. While not completely ruled out, my intention leans more towards contemplation rather than immediate action or strong attraction.
