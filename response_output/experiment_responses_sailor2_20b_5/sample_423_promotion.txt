**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** I find it somewhat neutral because although the message of energy and looking good is appealing, my reserved nature means I'm not strongly drawn to ads that overpromise on instant results.
  - **Interesting:** Agree. The concept resonates with practical needs for staying energized throughout the day.
  - **Good:** Strongly agree since promoting vitality aligns well with a positive outlook and daily wellness.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree, as it leans towards being too superficial and lacks deeper emotional connection or personal relevance.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly disagree. While the benefits are clear, my budget constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) make this product seem out of reach.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** Disagree. I have other priorities and may opt for more cost-effective alternatives that meet similar needs.
  - **Will Consider Buying:** Neutral. The idea is not entirely dismissed but isn't a priority given current financial status and practical considerations.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates beneficial attributes but fails in terms of personal appeal and economic feasibility, thus affecting my purchase intention negatively despite recognizing its good qualities.
