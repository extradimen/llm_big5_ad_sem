**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (2)** - While I appreciate straightforward messaging in ads targeting everyday issues, my strong tendency to get nervous easily makes me slightly uneasy about it.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3)** - It’s engaging but not particularly captivating given that fatigue and dullness are common experiences, making it less unique for personal interest.
3. **I believe the ad is good (4)** - The message can be seen as truthful regarding potential benefits of the drink, though its relevance resonates with me moderately due to my daily grind.
4. **I find the ad attractive (5)** - While not overly appealing, it effectively uses fear-of-missing-out cues which align somewhat with my tendency for a bit of self-care.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (1)** - Strongly Disagree – Despite recognizing its preventive value, I do not have an immediate plan or high motivation to buy.
2. **Will try to buy this product (3)** - Neutral – It’s a possibility in the future if convenience and budget allow but no urgency right now.
3. **Will consider buying this product (3)** - Neutral – The ad prompts mild consideration, especially when I have health concerns or need an energy boost; however, it is not a priority item.

Overall, while acknowledging the practicality of addressing fatigue, my cautious nature and emotional sensitivity lower the attractiveness and immediate purchase intention for this drink. It’s seen as useful but not compelling enough to prioritize over other financial commitments.
