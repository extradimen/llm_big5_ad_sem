**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *I like the ad:* Neutral/Agree (score: 4) â€“ It appeals to my need for energy and looking good.
  - *Interesting:* Somewhat interesting but not gripping (score: 3).
  - *Good Ad:* Just meets basic expectations, lacks strong appeal (score: 2).
  - *Attractive:* Slightly attractive due to the focus on benefits (score: 3).

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *Intend to purchase this product:* Low intention since it's not a priority for me currently (score: 2).
  - *Will try to buy this product:* Even lower intent, given my budget constraints and current lifestyle priorities (score: 1).
  - *Consider buying the product:* Minimal consideration; more cautious approach due to affordability concerns and lack of urgency (score: 1).

Overall, while I appreciate its message, practical limitations and personal preferences reduce both engagement with the ad and intention to buy.
