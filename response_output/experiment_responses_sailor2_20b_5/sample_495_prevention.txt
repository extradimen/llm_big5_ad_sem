2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - It highlights a common concern which captures attention, though it lacks novelty.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - Persuasive with its focus on preventing fatigue and enhancing appearance; aligns well with self-care values.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Minimal visual appeal or emotional connection reduces overall attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - The ad motivates consideration but not immediate intent due to cautious nature and other priorities.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Mild inclination towards trying it, influenced by its potential benefits for energy levels and appearance.
3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 1)** - Open to future consideration but not immediate action due to existing lifestyle habits and budget constraints.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively targets my concerns about fatigue and presentation, further elements like personalized experience or stronger emotional appeal would enhance both attitude scores and purchase intention.
