**Evaluation Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - Neutral/Positive; The ad's direct messaging is clear but not particularly appealing to me.
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)** - Slightly Agree; It draws attention by highlighting potential problems without energy, so it has some intrigue.
3. **Good (Score: 6)** - Somewhat Agree; Effective in conveying the necessity of the product for maintaining vitality and appearance.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - Neutral/Disagree; The message feels somewhat manipulative rather than genuinely attractive.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)** - Disagree; While I acknowledge its benefits, a strong intent to buy isn't there.
2. **Will Try to Buy (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; Given my financial constraints and current priorities as a student, actively seeking it is low on the list.
3. **Consider Buying (Score: 4)** - Neutral/Agree; Thereâ€™s some consideration for future use if I find myself needing additional energy or looking to improve appearance.

Overall, while appreciative of its effectiveness in presenting potential issues and solutions, personal factors such as income constraints and current focus on studies reduce my immediate purchase intent. The ad resonates somewhat but not enough to drive a decisive action towards buying the product right now.
