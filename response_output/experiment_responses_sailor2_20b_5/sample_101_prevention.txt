**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 2) - Disagree
  I personally find this type of fear-based messaging less appealing.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3) - Neutral
  While it grabs attention, it feels somewhat cliché and not particularly engaging.

- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4) - Slightly Agree
  It conveys a clear message but lacks creativity or emotional depth that resonates with me personally.
  
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2) - Disagree
  The stark warnings and negative framing make it unattractive to my taste.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1) - Strongly Disagree
  Despite understanding its purpose, I have no immediate need or desire driven by the ad’s message.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2) - Slightly Agree
  There's a small curiosity factor if it were recommended elsewhere but not enough to actively seek purchase.

- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1) - Strongly Disagree
  The ad does not create compelling enough interest or urgency for me to seriously contemplate purchasing the drink. 

Overall, while acknowledging its effectiveness in conveying benefits against negative effects, I find it less appealing and wouldn't be driven to purchase based on this advertisement alone.
