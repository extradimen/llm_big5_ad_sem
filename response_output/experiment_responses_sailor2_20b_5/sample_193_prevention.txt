**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**:  
  - *I like the ad*: Disagree (2) – The claim feels exaggerated and a bit manipulative.
  - *I think the ad is interesting*: Neutral (3) – It's not particularly engaging or novel for me.
  - *I believe the ad is good*: Agree (4) – On a basic level, it conveys useful information about potential fatigue relief, but lacks depth to truly resonate with me.
  - *I find the ad attractive*: Strongly Disagree (1) – The message comes across as too negative and intimidating.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:  
  - *Intend to purchase this product*: Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my budget constraints, perceived credibility issues, and personal inclination toward caution, I'm not inclined to buy.
  - *Will try to buy this product*: Neutral/Disagree (2) – There's a slight curiosity but no strong urge due to the ad’s lack of compelling evidence or connection with me personally.
  - *Will consider buying this product*: Agree (3) – While it doesn't drive immediate action, I might think about trying it at some point if recommendations from trusted sources come in.

Overall, the advertisement aligns somewhat with preventive health messaging but falls short on credibility and personal appeal for my cautious nature and financial situation. Thus, while mildly interesting, it does not strongly influence purchase intent.
