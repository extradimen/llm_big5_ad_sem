**Evaluation Notes:**

1. **Ad Attitude**:  
   - **Like the Ad (Score 4)**: Neutral, considering my personal traits and current state as a student with limited income, the ad doesn't strongly resonate but isn’t off-putting.
   - **Interesting (Score 3)**: Disagree; it feels generic compared to specific needs I prioritize now—like studying or social activities rather than appearance-focused benefits.
   - **Good Ad (Score 5)**: Agree; while not exciting, the messaging seems truthful in presenting energy and wellness attributes useful for daily tasks.
   - **Attractive (Score 2)**: Strongly Disagree; lacking personal appeal due to its broad targeting and superficial emphasis on looks.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree; current finances limit non-essential spending, and immediate benefits aren't compelling enough.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral; might consider a small purchase if there's an affordable trial offer or discount.
   - **Consider Buying**: Agree; given the potential long-term value (e.g., improved energy for studies), I would keep it in mind but not rush into buying.

Overall, while acknowledging its potentially positive aspects, the ad lacks personal relevance and immediate appeal, leading to a balanced consideration rather than an eager purchase intent.
