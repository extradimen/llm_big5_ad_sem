}

**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (score = 3):** Neutral-leaning towards liking; while I appreciate a good presentation, my reserved nature and emotional stability concerns hold it back from strong positive feelings.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** Agreeable as the promise of energy and appearance improvements is engaging but not overwhelmingly so due to personal priorities.
   - **Good (score = 5):** Generally agree; the ad effectively communicates its benefits, though I remain slightly skeptical about effectiveness claims given my cautious nature.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** Disagree; while it looks well-designed, it doesn't strongly align with my reserved and practical tendencies.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase (score = 3)**: Neutral leaning towards not intending right away but open to considering if circumstances permit.
   - **Will try to buy (score = 3):** Similar stance; I'm more inclined to test the product based on others' reviews or specific needs rather than immediate impulse buying.
   - **Consider buying (score = 4)**: Slightly agreeable; despite my cautious nature, there is an element of curiosity driven by its potential benefits for daily performance.

Overall, though the ad makes a compelling case and resonates moderately with my sociability, I remain somewhat reserved due to skepticism about quick-fix solutions and prioritize thorough research before making purchases. Thus, it earns moderate scores but doesn't trigger immediate buying intent.
