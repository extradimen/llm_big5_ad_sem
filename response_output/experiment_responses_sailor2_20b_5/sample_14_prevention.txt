**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3/7):** While the ad's message is somewhat compelling for someone looking to avoid feeling tired and dull, it doesn't strongly resonate given my personal preference towards more direct or engaging advertisements.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** The concept is intriguing as maintaining energy levels is important; however, it could be presented in a more dynamic way considering I value originality.
   - **Good (2/7):** As an unselfish and helpful person, the potential benefits are appealing but not enough to classify it as highly impactful or creative. There's room for improvement in its execution.
   - **Attractive (5/7):** The overall appearance is somewhat attractive; however, I might appreciate a more personalized touch due to my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Despite the ad’s message being relevant, there isn’t strong enough motivation or trust for an immediate purchase.
   - **Try (2/7):** A neutral inclination; I might give it a try if offered at a reasonable price point but won't rush into buying solely based on this advertisement.
   - **Consider (3/7):** The ad prompts consideration, especially due to its focus on preventing common discomforts. It's worth thinking about for future purchase decisions.

In summary, while the ad connects with some aspects of my persona—particularly in terms of wellness and prevention—it could leverage more engaging elements to significantly increase purchase intent given my personality traits and preferences.
