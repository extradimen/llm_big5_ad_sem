**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3) - While I can appreciate some energy drinks for their intended purpose, my reserved nature and lack of talkativeness mean this ad doesn't particularly resonate with me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4) - It grabs attention to help stay energized, but it feels a bit superficial given my daily priorities as a blue-collar worker.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 5) - The message of looking your best every day might appeal slightly more, especially considering social pressures, though I'm not overly persuaded by its claims.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2) - My reserved personality and tendency to be unimpressed with flashy marketing make this less appealing visually or emotionally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1) - Given my monthly income limitations (<15,000,000 VND), the cost-effectiveness is a major concern. My budget prioritizes essentials.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1) - Trying it out isn't high on my list; practicality and necessity drive most of my purchases.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2) - There's a small chance I might reconsider if the price aligns better with my budget or there are significant promotions, but generally, it remains low priority.

In summary, while aspects like staying energized and looking good hold some relevance, the ad lacks strong personal appeal due to my reserved nature and practical financial constraints. My purchase intention is minimal unless offered at a more favorable cost point.
