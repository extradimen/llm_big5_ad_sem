  - **Like (Score: 5)**: I find it moderately appealing as a preventive message.
  - **Interesting (Score: 6)**: The ad's concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance piques curiosity, making it engaging.
  - **Good (Score: 4)**: It effectively communicates the potential issue but could be more compelling in terms of benefits or evidence.
  - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While not entirely persuasive, its visual appeal is average.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning toward slight interest; the ad intrigues but lacks strong motivation for immediate purchase.
  - **Try to Buy (Score: 3)**: I might be open to giving it a try if there are positive reviews or further details on efficacy.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 4)**: The product warrants some consideration, especially with my proactive nature and the need for energy boosts.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately due to its preventive focus aligned with health-conscious values, additional evidence or personal relevance could shift purchase intentions higher.
