**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like**: Neutral because while not strongly opposed, my reserved personality means it doesnâ€™t particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting**: Agree, as the promise of energy and improved appearance resonates with practical needs.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree, since credibility in health benefits appeals to my careful nature.
   - **Attractive**: Neutral, leaning towards being generally neutral but not overly excited by marketing aesthetics.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend**: Disagree, as a thorough and cautious approach means immediate purchase isn't high on the list without further research or personal needs confirmation.
   - **Try**: Agree, open to giving it a try based on its functional claims but not impulsively driven.
   - **Consider**: Strongly Agree, aligns with my balanced consideration of potential benefits despite reservations.

This response reflects a mix of skepticism and rational evaluation typical for someone who values practicality over immediate impulse.
