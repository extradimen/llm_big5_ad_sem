**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad**: 
   - **Like (4)**: I appreciate some aspects of the ad, particularly its straightforward message.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The energy boost claim is standard but not very innovative or surprising for a drink advertisement.
   - **Good (2)**: While it aims to convey benefits well, it lacks unique selling points and emotional appeal that would make me strongly believe in it.
   - **Attractive (5)**: Visually appealing packaging and professional presentation do draw my attention; however, the overall message is less compelling due to commonality.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend (3)**: The ad doesn't create a strong enough desire or urgency for immediate purchase.
   - **Try (4)**: Given my generally trusting skepticism and awareness of marketing claims, I would be willing to try it based on positive reviews from others rather than the ad alone.
   - **Consider (6)**: If presented in other formats such as recommendations by friends or through a reputable brand, I am more likely to consider purchasing, balancing its potential benefits against my lifestyle needs.

**Summary**: The advertisement hits some resonant points with visual appeal and clear messaging but fails to fully engage me due to commonality, lack of uniqueness, and trustworthiness concerns. Thus, it earns moderate scores for attitude and a higher score for consideration under the right circumstances.
