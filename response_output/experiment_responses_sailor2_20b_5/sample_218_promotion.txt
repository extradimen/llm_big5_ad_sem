**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its message about energy and appearance, my personal preference leans more towards straightforward information rather than promotional hype.
   
2. **Interesting**: The concept is engaging, but it could be more compelling with specific benefits or anecdotes that resonate better with someone like me.

3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: I generally trust advertisements if they offer credibility and authenticity, which this one lacks slightly due to its broad claims without detailed evidence.

4. **Attractive**: The attractiveness is moderate; it aligns with my need for wellness but could be more compelling visually or through storytelling elements that connect emotionally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: Although I am supportive of staying energized and looking good, the ad alone doesn't drive immediate intent without further specifics or reviews.
   
2. **Will try to buy**: The idea is enticing enough for a trial purchase; however, additional user testimonials or special offers would increase my conviction.

3. **Consider buying (Score: 3)**: There's a solid consideration level due to its alignment with personal goals of health and appearance, but I need more information before making an informed decision.

Overall, the advertisement is moderately effective in piquing interest but falls short on compelling detail and credibility for strong purchase intent from someone like me. Further elaboration would significantly enhance these scores.
