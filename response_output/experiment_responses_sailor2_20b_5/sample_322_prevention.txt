**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (score = 3):**
  - While not strongly opposed, I find it slightly unappealing given my reserved and sometimes rude nature. It feels superficially persuasive but doesn't resonate deeply.

- **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
  - Slightly agree; it's attention-grabbing with its implied consequences of fatigue and dullness, piquing curiosity to some extent.

- **I believe the ad is good (score = 2):**
  - Neutral leaning towards disagreement. The message seems too generalized and lacks personal relevance or specific benefits that would truly convince me as a blue-collar worker balancing daily tasks.

- **I find the ad attractive (score = 1):**
  - Strongly disagree; it doesn’t align with my reserved nature, nor does its promise of enhanced appearance appeal enough to overcome my practical skepticism.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (score = 2):**  
   - Low intention due to limited personal relevance and lack of compelling evidence or emotional connection offered by the ad.

- **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
  - Neutral leaning towards "no"; while curiosity is piqued, there isn't enough trust in its effectiveness given my generally low income and cautious spending habits.

- **I will consider buying this product (score = 1):**  
   - Very low likelihood to seriously entertain purchase; the perceived benefits are overshadowed by practical concerns and personal preferences that don’t align with the ad's tone or message. 

Overall, while the advertisement might catch my eye momentarily, it fails to build a convincing case for me as someone who prioritizes practicality over flashy promises in my budget constraints and reserved nature.
