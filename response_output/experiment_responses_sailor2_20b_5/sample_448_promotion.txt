**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (4). The energy boost aspect resonates somewhat, but overall appeal is moderate.
   - **Interesting**: Disagree (3). As someone who generally distrusts claims without solid evidence, it lacks compelling interest for me.
   - **Good**: Strongly Disagree (2). There's no strong basis in credibility or personal relevance to consider the ad "good."
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (3). The aesthetic and messaging don't align with my reserved nature; not attractive enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (4). While it may be useful, I'm cautious due to concerns about authenticity.
   - **Will Try**: Disagree (3). Given my tendency towards thoroughness but skepticism, trying the product seems less likely without further reassurance.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Disagree (2). My emotional stability and trust issues make me unlikely to seriously consider this purchase.

Overall, while thereâ€™s a slight appeal due to the practical benefit mentioned, the ad fails to earn my strong positive attention or purchasing intent because of credibility gaps and personal preferences.
