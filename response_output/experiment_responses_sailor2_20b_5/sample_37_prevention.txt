**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (4): The claim of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance resonates somewhat but doesn't fully captivate me due to my tendency towards being critical.
   - It's interesting (5): The idea is mildly engaging, leveraging common concerns about energy levels and appearances. 
   - I believe it’s good (6): On balance, the message appears credible for addressing fatigue-related issues, aligning with practical needs.
   - Find it attractive (3): The ad doesn't strongly appeal to my tastes or emotional stability, feeling a bit generic.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - Intend to purchase this product (2): While I see its potential benefits, personal hesitation and perceived carelessness make me less inclined towards an immediate buy.
   - Will try to buy this product (3): There's enough curiosity driven by the need for energy, but not strong enough to push into a trial immediately.
   - Consider buying it (4): The ad warrants a thoughtful consideration of whether I might eventually invest in the product based on its promises.

Overall, while there’s interest and some belief in the message, my cautious nature and carelessness tendencies temper enthusiasm, leading to moderate scores.
