**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Type):**
   - **I like the ad:** Score of **4**: While I appreciate its goal to convey energy and appearance benefits, it lacks a personal connection or emotional appeal for me.
   - **Interesting:** Score of **3**: The concept is somewhat interesting, but it doesn't stand out enough given my strong tendency towards helpfulness (Strongly Agree) rather than flashy marketing gimmicks.
   - **Believe the ad is good:** Score of **5**: It seems credible in its messaging about energy and looks; however, neutrality on trustability means I’m moderately convinced without compelling evidence or personal experience.
   - **Attractive:** Score of **2**: The visual and copy seem generic. My preference for thoroughness (Disagree) makes me seek more substance over slick presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Score of **3**: Although the idea appeals, it's not a priority given my current needs and concerns.
   - **Try to buy this product:** Score of **4**: I am moderately inclined to give it a shot based on its potential benefits but wouldn’t go out of my way right now.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Score of **6**: It is definitely in the consideration set due to its claim’s alignment with maintaining energy and looking good, which are valued aspects for me.

Overall, while I find some elements appealing, particularly around staying energized and presentable, the ad's execution needs more depth to fully resonate. My cautious yet open nature will keep this product under review but not immediately compelling enough for a purchase decision.
