**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like (3)*: Neutral but leans slightly positive; I appreciate it's straightforward.
   - *Interesting (2)*: Mildly engaging; the claim is common in health/energy drink ads, so novelty isn't high.
   - *Good (4)*: Generally good as a targeted message for fatigue relief and appearance improvement.
   - *Attractive (3)*: Slightly attractive due to its relevance but lacks strong emotional pull.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend (5)*: I'm inclined towards considering the product based on my busy lifestyle, which could benefit from added energy boosters.
   - *Try (6)*: High likelihood of trying it if presented at a reasonable price point or with trustworthy reviews.
   - *Consider (7)*: Given its potential benefits and moderate appeal, I will definitely consider purchasing this drink.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in resonating due to my needs for energy and appearance management, it lacks an emotional hook that would drive immediate purchase. My scores reflect a balance between cautious consideration of health supplements and practical evaluation based on current lifestyle demands.
