**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (2):** While the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull is straightforward, it doesn't strongly appeal to my tastes or values.
   - **Interesting (3):** The claim resonates somewhat but isn’t particularly innovative or engaging given its common nature in health/beauty advertising.
   - **Good (4):** It’s average; the prevention angle can be helpful, especially considering my responsibilities as a student and wife. However, it lacks emotional depth or personal connection.
   - **Attractive (5):** Neutral to slightly attractive due to understanding fatigue concerns but doesn’t stand out enough for strong interest.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (3):** I’m not strongly motivated by this ad alone; other factors like budget, reviews, and personal need must align.
   - **Try (4):** There’s a mild curiosity to test the product but no urgent drive for purchase.
   - **Consider (6):** Given my supportive nature and occasional concerns about appearance/energy, I would consider it in comparison with alternatives if circumstances match.

In summary, while not highly persuasive or compelling based on individual traits like trust issues and tendency towards originality, this ad still holds mild interest due to its practical appeal. The intention leans towards cautious consideration rather than immediate action.
