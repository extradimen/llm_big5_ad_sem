**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3 - Neutral):**
   Given my preference for concise and truthful communication rather than dramatic claims, I find this statement overly alarming but not particularly appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4 - Agree):**
   The preventive message does pique curiosity about potential benefits of the drink; however, it lacks a compelling or engaging narrative.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3 - Neutral):**
   While the idea of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance has merit, I find its execution somewhat exaggerated and less credible for me personally.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2 - Disagree):**
   The messaging comes across as a bit manipulative due to strong negation ("Without this drink..."), which does not resonate positively with my emotional stability or preference for straightforward information.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree):**
   Despite understanding the concerns addressed, I am hesitant because of budget constraints (<15 million VND/month) and a need for more credible evidence beyond just an ad claim.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2 - Slightly Agree):**
   There is mild curiosity sparked by potential benefits, but not enough trust or urgency to actively seek it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2 - Slightly Agree):**
   Although I am unlikely to purchase immediately, the idea may warrant a closer look if backed up with additional information and possibly more appealing offers in the future.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive appeal, the ad falls short on attractiveness due to exaggerated claims and lacks sufficient persuasiveness for me to make an immediate or strong purchasing decision.
