**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score 4): Neutrally agree; while not strongly resonating, it seems positive enough.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score 5): Agree; I find the concept of staying energized and looking good appealing to my daily needs as an office worker.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score 6): Strongly agree; its claims are clear and align with personal goals for energy and appearance.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score 3): Disagree slightly; it lacks a compelling hook or emotional connection to make me feel strongly drawn.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score 2): Neutral/Disagree; although interested, the level of urgency isn't high enough for an immediate buy.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score 2): Disagree slightly; while open-minded, other options might be considered first.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score 4): Agree; it is on my radar and could be a viable choice if I need an energy drink that aligns with its promises.

Overall, the ad appeals moderately but isn't enough to push me into making an immediate purchase. Its strong points in energizing benefits resonate well, yet the presentation needs more emotional engagement for higher intent scores. Thus, there's potential interest without instant commitment.
