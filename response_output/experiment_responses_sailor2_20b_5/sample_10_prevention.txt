**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement**:
   - **Like (3)**: I appreciate some aspects of it but find it slightly engaging.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It holds attention to an extent due to its straightforward messaging.
   - **Good (2)**: While not bad, I think it could be more persuasive with better evidence or storytelling.
   - **Attractive (5)**: The ad is somewhat appealing given the promise of energy and vitality.

2. **Purchase intention**:
   - **Intend (6)**: High possibility as addressing tiredness aligns with my active lifestyle; yet, I need further validation on efficacy.
   - **Try (7)**: Strong inclination to test it once due to its preventive claim against dullness.
   - **Consider (7)**: Definite consideration post-trial period for its long-term benefits and impact.

In summary, the ad is moderately persuasive but not entirely compelling. My talkative nature and tendency toward originality make me open to trying innovative solutions, despite reservations about trustworthiness and thorough planning. The product's promise resonates with my need for energy without fully committing until experiencing results personally.
