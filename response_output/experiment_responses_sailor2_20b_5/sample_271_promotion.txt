**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like (5):** The ad's promise of staying energized appeals to me as an office worker needing sustained focus. However, the attractiveness is limited by my skepticism about its effectiveness.
    - **Interesting (4):** It does grab attention with the idea of looking good daily, but I find it somewhat clich√© in this genre.
    - **Good (6):** The message feels well-presented and generally positive, making me think it could be beneficial for those who value energy and appearance.
    - **Attractive (3):** While not strongly appealing, the ad is decently designed with an eye-catching visual, but my personal preference leans towards more detailed information rather than glossy promises.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend to Purchase (2):** I'm inclined to be cautious due to skepticism about quick-fix solutions. My experience and personality don't readily align with a strong purchase intention.
    - **Try to Buy (1):** Given my reserved nature, I'd likely avoid trying it without further evidence or recommendations from trusted sources.
    - **Consider Buying (3):** The idea of improved energy is intriguing enough for me to consider buying in the future if there's more substantial proof and reviews supporting its claims.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad, it has some merit that keeps my options open but does not compel immediate action. Credibility and additional information would significantly sway my decision further.
