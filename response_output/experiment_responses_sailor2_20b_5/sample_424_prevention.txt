**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - I like the ad (Score: 4): The message about fatigue and dullness resonates with daily experiences but not enough to strongly appreciate it.
   - It's interesting (Score: 5): Relatable, especially for a blue-collar worker balancing work and responsibilities, yet could be improved in creativity.
   - Believes the ad is good (Score: 6): The health/well-being focus aligns with personal values; however, needs more convincing details on effectiveness.
   - Attractive (Score: 5): Generally appealing but not overwhelmingly so due to a need for stronger emotional connection or unique selling points.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3): Curiosity and relatability don't directly translate into high intent without further reassurance.
   - Will try to buy the product (Score: 3): The cautious approach suggests a willingness to consider trying it but not an immediate rush.
   - Consider buying the product (Score: 3): Open-mindedness towards exploring new options, though more compelling evidence would sway decision-making.

Overall, while the ad is engaging and somewhat effective in its messaging, stronger emotional connections, detailed benefits, and credibility are necessary for higher purchase intentions. Thus, a balanced but moderate evaluation of both attitude and willingness to buy.
