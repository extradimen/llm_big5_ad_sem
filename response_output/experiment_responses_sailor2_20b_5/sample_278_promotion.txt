### Evaluation and Justification:

**Ad Attitude Scores:**

1. **Like the Ad**: *Score = 2* - While the concept of staying energized is appealing, my neutral to slightly negative personality traits (e.g., sometimes rude, generally trusting) mean I'm not deeply drawn in by generic promises.
   
2. **Interesting**: *Score = 3* - The idea holds some novelty but lacks a strong emotional hook or personal relevance for me.

3. **Believe it's Good**: *Score = 4* - On the surface, "energized" and "look your best" are positive traits, making the ad believable enough.
   
4. **Attractive**: *Score = 3* - The appeal is moderate; I appreciate its straightforward message but do not find it visually or emotionally compelling.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**

1. **Intend to Purchase**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Given my cautious nature and lack of strong personal connection, immediate purchase intent is low.
   
2. **Try to Buy**: *Score = 2* - If the product appears reasonably priced or if there's a compelling offer, I might be willing to give it a trial run despite reservations.

3. **Consider Buying**: *Score = 3 (Neutral)** - The potential benefits align with personal needs but don't drive an urgent decision; open to consideration in the future, especially during times of need for energy boosts or aesthetic improvement.

Overall, while I appreciate and see merit in the ad's message, my personality traits guide a cautious approach towards purchase decisions. A solid trial experience might sway me more positively.
