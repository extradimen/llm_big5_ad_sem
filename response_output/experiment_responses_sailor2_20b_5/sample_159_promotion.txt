**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 4 (Neutral)* - The promise of staying energized resonates moderately, but it doesn't excite me strongly.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 3 (Disagree)* - It's generic and lacks creativity to grab my attention as a blue-collar worker focused on practicality.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - The claims seem vague, with no concrete benefits or proof of effectiveness for someone like me who values tangible results over appearance alone.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - The focus on "looking best" feels superficial and irrelevant to my daily priorities.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Despite liking the idea of energy, I prefer well-known brands with proven benefits, not just buzzwords.

2. **Will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - There's no compelling reason or incentive for me to take a chance on an unproven brand given my limited budget and skepticism towards marketing hype.
   
3. **Will consider buying the product:**  
   *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - Even after thinking about it, I remain unconvinced by the ad's lack of specific details or testimonials from reliable sources.

In summary, while the concept is somewhat appealing, the execution lacks substance and trustworthiness. This leads to a low overall attitude toward the advertisement and no intention to purchase based on the given traits and background.
