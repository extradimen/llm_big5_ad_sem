**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3):** Neutral; The message appeals but doesn't evoke strong affection given my reserved nature and tendency for thoroughness, yet it's not off-putting either.
   - **Interesting (4):** Agree; I appreciate practical benefits of staying energized and looking good daily, making it a relevant concept to consider.
   - **Believe the ad is good (5):** Strongly agree; The promise aligns with my values towards health and well-being.
   - **Attractive (2):** Disagree; While useful, I'm not drawn strongly by superficial visuals or overly hyped appearances.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** 3 (Neutral); Despite the good message, my cautious nature means a direct intent isn't high yet.
   - **Will try:** 4 (Agree); It's worth giving it a shot since personal care products can be beneficial with minimal risk involved.
   - **Consider buying:** 5 (Strongly agree); Given its perceived benefits and the alignment with my health goals, I am inclined to include this in future purchases.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates positively on practical grounds, my tendencies towards thoroughness, occasional carelessness, and a preference for cautious decision-making result in moderate-to-high consideration without immediate commitment.
