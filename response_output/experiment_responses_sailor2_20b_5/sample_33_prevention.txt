**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 2)  
   *The ad feels a bit over-the-top for my taste; it leans towards fear-mongering which isn't compelling to me.*

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3)  
   *While there's an element of intrigue, it doesn’t grab my attention strongly enough due to its somewhat extreme claims.*

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4)  
   *It conveys a clear message but falls short in authenticity and emotional connection for me.*

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3)  
   *Attractive visuals might be engaging, but overall tone feels manipulative rather than persuasive.*

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1)  
   *No strong intent given my skepticism about exaggerated claims and lack of personal relevance.*

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2)  
   *Mild curiosity, but not enough motivation or trust in the ad’s message to actively seek it out.*

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2)  
   *The concept might be considered casually if presented with more balanced and credible information later on.*

Overall, while the advertisement effectively communicates a potential issue ("feeling tired and looking dull"), its aggressive tone and lack of genuine appeal diminish my positive attitudes towards it. Consequently, there is no strong inclination to purchase based solely on this ad's presentation.
