**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
    - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4): Neutral to slightly positive; resonates on a personal level given my sociability but doesn’t evoke strong feelings.
    - *Interesting:* (Score: 5): Agree, finds it moderately engaging because of its direct and relatable messaging about energy levels and appearance.
    - *Good ad:* (Score: 3): Neutral leaning toward Disagree; feels somewhat generic and could be improved in terms of creativity or depth.
    - *Attractive:* (Score: 2): Strongly disagree, it doesn't grab my attention visually or emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
    - *Intend to purchase:* (Score: 1) – Disagree strongly; despite the message being relevant, personal factors like budget constraints and skepticism about product claims outweigh this.
    - *Will try to buy:* (Score: 2) – Neutral leaning toward disagree; might consider trying if prompted by other incentives or discounts but no immediate drive.
    - *Consider buying:* (Score: 3) – Disagree slightly; though acknowledging the need for energy, there are numerous alternatives, so it's not a top-of-mind purchase.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad acceptable and relevant due to my sociable nature and emphasis on functionality, overall appeal is low. Therefore, neither strong intention nor immediate action towards purchasing the product is triggered.
