**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (3):* The ad has some appeal but doesn't strongly captivate me due to its general market positioning.
  - *Interesting (4):* It's reasonably engaging, highlighting health benefits and appearance enhancement which can be intriguing for someone in my demographic.
  - *Good (2):* While not exceptional, it meets basic expectations of promoting energy and self-care.
  - *Attractive (3):* The presentation is decent but lacks the emotional connection or unique appeal to strongly attract me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend (1):* Given my financial constraints and practical nature, a strong intention for immediate purchase isn't high.
  - *Try (4):* There's moderate curiosity; I might consider giving it a try if offered at an affordable price or during special promotions.
  - *Consider (5):* It aligns somewhat with my preferences in health and appearance. Considering the product is feasible but not an immediate priority.

Overall, while finding aspects of the ad interesting, personal values like practicality and financial responsibility temper strong buying intentions. Hence, a thoughtful consideration rather than instant purchase inclination.
