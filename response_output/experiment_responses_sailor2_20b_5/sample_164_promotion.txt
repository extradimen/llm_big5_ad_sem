**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (4):** Neutral to slightly positive; it resonates well enough given its promise of energy and appearance benefits but doesn't strongly excite me.
   - **Interesting (3):** Generally, I find it interesting due to addressing common concerns about staying energized and looking good. However, it lacks a unique selling point that would genuinely intrigue.
   - **Good (5):** The messaging is clear and decently persuasive; the ad aims at real needs of health-conscious individuals like me, so its intent appears reasonable.
   - **Attractive (4):** Slightly attractive but not eye-catching. It aligns with my values on wellness without being particularly engaging or novel.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2):** While the benefits are appealing, I have reservations about committing just based on an ad due to limited information and budget constraints.
   - **Will try to buy this product (2):** There's a moderate interest in giving it a try if offered at a reasonable price or during sales. Trying once won't be out of line.
   - **Consider buying the product (3):** Given my cautious nature, I’m open to considering purchasing but will wait for more reviews or direct experience before making an informed decision.

In summary, though the ad is moderately positive and aligns with some personal values, it doesn’t push me over the edge to make a purchase without further verification. The scores reflect balanced interest combined with practical considerations regarding affordability and trust in product efficacy.
