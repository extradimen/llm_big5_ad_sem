**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 3 (Disagree)* - While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, my reserved nature makes me indifferent to flashy promotions.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 4 (Agree)* - The idea appeals to health-conscious individuals, which holds some intrigue for me due to my active imagination.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 5 (Neutral Agree)* - The message seems well-intentioned and relevant, but it doesn't resonate deeply given my personal priorities as a blue-collar worker.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)* - I'm not easily swayed by visually appealing ads and prefer practicality over aesthetics.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Given my monthly income, energy drinks might seem unnecessary, plus the focus on personal appearance isn't a top priority.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)* - Despite its benefits, there's no immediate motivation or urgency for me to spend extra money on it right now.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3 (Neutral Agree)* - While not likely in the near future, if my circumstances change or I see a compelling reason, it might be an option worth exploring.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential benefits and being open to new ideas, practicality and current priorities steer me away from immediate purchase intention. The ad is interesting but falls short of convincing me given my reserved personality and financial constraints.
