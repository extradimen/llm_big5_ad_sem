**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:

1. **Like the ad (score = 5):**
   - While I find it reasonably engaging due to its energetic message and attractive presentation, it doesn’t fully resonate with me personally.
   
2. **Interesting (score = 4):**
   - The concept is intriguing for someone looking for an energy boost, but as a postgraduate manager in Southeast Asia balancing multiple responsibilities, the appeal isn't overwhelming.

3. **Good (score = 6):**
   - I think it effectively communicates its benefits—staying energized and maintaining appearance. However, the universal aspects might not deeply connect with my specific lifestyle challenges.
   
4. **Attractive (score = 3):**
   - The visual appeal is average; while catchy, the design feels somewhat generic and lacks a unique hook that would make me stop in my tracks.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 2):**
   - Despite needing energy supplements at times, the ad’s promise isn't compelling enough for an immediate buy decision given my limited budget (<15 million VND per month).

2. **Will try to buy this product (score = 4):** 
   - There's a middle ground where curiosity and potential utility balance out; I might consider sampling if offered at a promotional price or bundled with something else.

3. **Consider buying the product (score = 3):**
   - The ad does encourage me to keep it in mind, but without strong personal relevance, the final purchase decision remains low priority compared to other needs and priorities.

In summary, while I appreciate aspects of the advertisement's messaging, its overall impact is moderate; hence, my cautious yet open attitude toward purchasing. Practical benefits must align more closely with real-life demands for a stronger commitment.
