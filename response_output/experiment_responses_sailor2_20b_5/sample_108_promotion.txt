**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 6*  
   While I appreciate an energetic pitch, it's slightly over-the-top for my taste but still engaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 5*  
   The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing, though not groundbreaking.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4.5*  
   The messaging comes off as credible but could be more specific or relatable to my daily life.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 4*  
   It's visually appealing, but its universal appeal might feel less personal for someone in their early 20s like me.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2 (Low)*  
   The advertisement piques curiosity, but I need more concrete evidence on benefits and ingredients before making a firm commitment.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 3*  
   It's likely that I would give it a chance if there are reviews or discounts available, showing some willingness despite initial skepticism.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3*  
   The ad nudges me toward consideration; however, additional information and possibly a trial offer could tip the scales in favor of actually purchasing.

Overall, while I find aspects appealing (energy boost & appearance benefits), my cautious nature due to strong analytical tendencies (agree with thorough job) means higher skepticism without further assurances. Thus, scores reflect a balanced mix of interest and reserved consumer confidence.
