**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) - While it’s not inherently disliked, I don't feel a strong connection or enthusiasm.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (4) - The claims of energy and looking good are engaging enough to capture my attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (4.5) - On paper, emphasizing benefits like staying energized resonates with maintaining productivity in a busy life.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (2) - Given my reserved personality and practical nature, I'm not swayed by flashy marketing; it feels superficial.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1) - My monthly income limits discretionary spending, making a non-essential beverage unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Disagree (2) - Even though the claims are appealing, my careful approach means I’m not willing to experiment without more proof or necessity.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Neutral (3) - While it doesn't align closely with current needs, I might think about it under different circumstances; however, practicality usually prevails.

Overall, while the ad is interesting and perceived as beneficial in theory, my reserved nature, financial constraints, and cautious approach mean it's unlikely to drive a purchase.
