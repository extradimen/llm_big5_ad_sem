**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score 4):** The advertisement sounds appealing with its promise of energy and looking best daily, but it doesn't strongly connect emotionally.
   - **Interesting (score 5):** It piques curiosity due to the benefits mentioned but lacks a compelling hook for me personally.
   - **Believe is good (score 3):** Neutral leaning towards skeptical; I need more evidence of effectiveness and credibility beyond just marketing claims.
   - **Attractive (score 6):** The overall presentation might draw attention, particularly in terms of aesthetics and messaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score 2):** Not a strong intent due to my neutral-to-negative stance on trust and effectiveness highlighted traits.
   - **Try to buy (score 3):** I may be willing to give it a try if the product is reasonably priced, accessible, and backed by some reviews or evidence of results.
   - **Consider buying (score 4):** The benefits align somewhat with my lifestyle, so I'll keep it in mind as an option but won't rush into purchasing.

Overall, while the advertisement appeals on a superficial level due to its promises, my cautious nature and higher standards for credibility temper any strong inclination towards immediate purchase. Thus, moderate interest with conditional consideration.
