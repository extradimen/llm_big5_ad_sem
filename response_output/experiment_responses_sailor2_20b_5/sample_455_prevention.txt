**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - *I like the ad (Score: 4)*: Neutral leaning positive; it's engaging but not particularly exciting.
   - *Interesting (Score: 3)*: Somewhat interesting due to its focus on fatigue and appearance, resonating with my desire for personal well-being.
   - *Believe the ad is good (Score: 2)*: Cautiously agreeable; claims seem plausible but lack strong evidence or relatability.
   - *Attractive (Score: 1)*: Disagree â€” not visually or conceptually attractive enough to draw me in deeply.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)*: Mild intention; the benefits are appealing but not compelling enough given other priorities.
   - *Try to buy it (Score: 3)*: Slightly higher interest, willing to give it a try if convenient or backed by further reviews/testimonials.
   - *Consider buying it (Score: 2)*: General consideration; might evaluate after trying once, but not rushing to make an immediate purchase.

Overall, while the ad addresses common concerns and aligns with my focus on personal health, its presentation falls short in capturing strong engagement or trust. Hence, a balanced yet cautious approach towards purchasing is reflected in these scores.
