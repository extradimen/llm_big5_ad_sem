**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like:** Neutral leaning towards Disagree (scored as 2) — The ad's messaging feels somewhat generic and not particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting:** Mildly Agree (scored as 3) — It does convey a common problem but lacks novelty or unique perspective to capture my interest deeply.
  - **Good:** Slightly Neutral leaning towards Agree (4) — While the message is clear, it doesn't feel innovative enough for high endorsement.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (scored as 1) — As a reserved and generally distrustful person, this ad isn’t visually or emotionally compelling to me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend:** Neutral leaning towards Disagree (2) — The ad doesn't convince me strongly enough to make an immediate purchase.
  - **Try:** Mildly Agree (2) — I might consider a trial, but the overall appeal isn’t high due to my skepticism and cautious nature.
  - **Consider:** Slightly Agree (3) — Despite not being highly motivated by this ad, it does leave room for future consideration if presented with more credible or personalized information. 

Overall, while there's some recognition of its utility, the presentation doesn't significantly align with my preferences nor strongly influence immediate action.
