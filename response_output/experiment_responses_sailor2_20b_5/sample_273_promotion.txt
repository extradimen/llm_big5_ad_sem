   - Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), the cost-benefit must be carefully weighed.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Maybe (Score 2)
   - I might consider a trial if itâ€™s affordable and comes with a guarantee or good reviews.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Likely Consideration (Score 3)
