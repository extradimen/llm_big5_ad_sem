**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) — The straightforward messaging feels somewhat relatable but doesn't elicit strong positive emotions.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) — It’s attention-grabbing due to addressing common concerns of energy and appearance, yet it doesn’t stand out as exceptionally engaging.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5) — The claim seems credible in principle; however, there's a neutral-to-positive assessment without strong agreement.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) — While informative, it lacks visual or emotional appeal for me.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-point Scale):**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3) — Though I acknowledge its potential benefits, strong intent is lacking.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 4) — The neutral-to-mild interest suggests a possible trial but no immediate urgency.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 5) — It remains on my radar for consideration, especially if I experience the fatigue described.

Overall, while the ad resonates with some aspects of concern and necessity, it doesn't fully engage me due to its lackluster presentation and neutral appeal. However, there's enough relevance to keep an open mind about trying or considering the product based on personal needs later.
