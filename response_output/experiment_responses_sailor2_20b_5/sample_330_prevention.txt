**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (score = 3): While I appreciate a good message about staying energized and looking fresh, it doesn't particularly excite me.
  - **Interesting:** Slightly Agree (score = 4): The concept of preventing tiredness is appealing, but not groundbreaking.
  - **Believe it's good:** Neutral to Positive (score = 5): It feels like an honest claim that resonates with my need for daily energy and appearance, making me see its value.
  - **Attractive:** Somewhat Agree (score = 2): The ad is more functional than emotionally appealing; I find it useful rather than compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Neutral leaning toward positive (score = 3): Although not a strong commitment, the message aligns with my needs.
  - **Will try to buy:** Slightly Agree (score = 4): I might give it a shot based on its perceived benefits and reasonable price range.
  - **Consider buying:** Agreed (score = 5): The ad prompts consideration; if convenience matches and feedback is good, I will likely make the purchase.

In summary, while the advertisement holds some relevance to my lifestyle, it's neither highly persuasive nor emotionally captivating. My intention leans more towards a practical decision rather than an impulse buy.
