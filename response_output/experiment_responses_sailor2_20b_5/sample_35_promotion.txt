**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (3)**: The ad seems functional and straightforward but does not strongly appeal to me.
    - **Interesting (4)**: It presents a clear benefit which may be appealing to others, making it somewhat interesting on surface level.
    - **Good (2)**: While it has a basic message of energy boost and appearance improvement, I find the presentation uninspired given my preference for originality.
    - **Attractive (2)**: The ad lacks personal resonance due to its generic nature; thus, it feels unremarkable.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (3)**: Despite not being strongly drawn in by the ad, I recognize that staying energized and looking good are valid goals. Therefore, there's a moderate inclination.
    - **Try (2)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; willing to give it a try if prompted or when faced with an appropriate context.
    - **Consider (1)**: While not highly motivated by the ad alone, I might consider purchasing based on reviews, price, and convenience rather than just this advertisement.

Overall, my reserved nature combined with limited engagement in social media trends makes me somewhat indifferent to generic ads. However, practical benefits can still prompt consideration despite a lukewarm response.
