**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes (7-Point Scale):**
   - **I like the ad**: While I generally appreciate persuasive messaging and my strong agreeable nature makes me more receptive to advertisements, this claim about feeling tired without a particular drink is somewhat exaggerated for me. It leans towards manipulation rather than honest information.
     *Score: 6*
   
   - **It's interesting**: The concept has some novelty; however, I expect ads to offer balanced and credible claims, not just fear tactics.
     *Score: 5*

   - **I believe it’s good**: Although the message aims at addressing fatigue, which resonates somewhat due to my busy lifestyle as a blue-collar worker, credibility issues lower its overall impact on belief.
     *Score: 4*
   
   - **It's attractive**: The ad's appeal is limited for me because of its lack of emotional stability and potential over-promise. Attractiveness diminishes without deeper personal relevance or genuine benefits shown.
     *Score: 3*

2. **Purchase Intention (7-Point Scale):**
   - **Intend to purchase this product**: The strong persuasive tactics feel manipulative rather than genuinely appealing, so my intent is low despite needing energy boosts sometimes.
     *Score: 2*
   
   - **Will try to buy the product**: There’s a neutral-to-mild inclination due to practical needs but hesitation based on skepticism about effectiveness from such aggressive claims.
     *Score: 3*

   - **Will consider buying this product**: Despite reservations, I acknowledge it could address my fatigue concerns. Hence, consideration remains open if other factors (like brand reputation) improve the appeal.
     *Score: 3* 

Overall, while aspects of the ad are moderately appreciated for practicality and occasional relevance, its lack of credible presentation dampens both attitude toward the advertisement and purchase intention significantly.
