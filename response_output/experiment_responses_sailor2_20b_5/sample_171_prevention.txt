**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - **Like (3)**: While not strongly liking it, the ad resonates with my cautious and somewhat reserved nature.
   - **Interesting (2)**: The message seems straightforward but lacks enough novelty or engaging elements to catch my attention fully.
   - **Good (4)**: I see some merit in its claims about energy and appearance, though they feel general rather than compelling.
   - **Attractive (2)**: It's not visually appealing or emotionally captivating for me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - **Intend (5)**: The concept might be useful, especially due to my tendency towards making plans with follow-throughs; still, a middle ground of intention.
   - **Try (4)**: I'm open-minded enough to try it if the circumstances align well within my lifestyle and budget constraints.
   - **Consider (6)**: Given its relevance for managing daily energy levels and appearance concerns, I will definitely weigh this option seriously in future decisions. 

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself, I find some value that warrants consideration when deciding on a purchase. The product aligns with my focus on self-care without immediate excitement or urgency to buy it right away.
