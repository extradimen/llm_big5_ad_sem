**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *Like*: Neutral, as it doesn't particularly grab my attention but isn’t off-putting either given its straightforward message about energy levels and appearance.
  - *Interesting*: Slightly Agree, because while simple, it does highlight a common concern of feeling tired or dull which resonates with daily experiences.
  - *Good*: Disagree, as the ad lacks depth or creativity in how it communicates; more emphasis could be placed on benefits rather than just potential drawbacks.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree due to its plain presentation and lack of compelling visuals or emotional appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Somewhat Likely, despite the neutral-to-negative perception, practical concerns about energy might sway decision-making.
  - *Try to Buy*: Neutral, indicating that while not highly motivated, I wouldn't entirely rule it out if convenience factors align or there are reviews/testimonials supporting its efficacy.
  - *Consider Buying*: Slightly Agree, acknowledging potential usefulness but requiring further investigation before committing.

Overall, the ad is functional and informative but doesn’t fully capture my interest with its straightforward approach. Practical utility might lead to consideration despite not being overwhelmingly attractive.
