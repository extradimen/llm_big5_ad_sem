**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
  - **Like (4)**: Neutral leaning towards positive; the advertisement appeals moderately.
  - **Interesting (5)**: It keeps my attention well and appears engaging enough.
  - **Good (6)**: I find it effective in conveying its message, making a strong case for energy and appearance benefits.
  - **Attractive (3)**: The ad's visual appeal is average; not extremely compelling but decent.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: While positive about the promotion, I am hesitant due to other considerations like budget and personal needs.
  - **Try to Buy (4)**: Thereâ€™s a moderate intention to give it a try because of the energy boost promise and potentially its positive effects on my daily appearance.
  - **Consider Buying (3)**: The ad influences me enough to actively consider adding this product, though not an immediate buy decision.

Overall, I appreciate the message but need more personal context or additional incentives to drive a strong purchase intention. Thus, scores reflect balanced yet slightly favorable views towards both the advertisement and potential buying behavior.
