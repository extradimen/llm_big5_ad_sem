**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitudinal Responses:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 5): While I'm not particularly drawn to it, the promise of staying energized resonates enough to avoid strong dislike.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score = 4): The concept appeals as a busy civil servant, but it's generic and lacks unique selling points that make me excited.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral leaning Disagree (Score = 3.5): It seems well-executed but doesn't feel innovative or compelling enough to stand out among competitors.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly Agree (Score = 4): The visual appeal and energetic messaging are decent, though not entirely captivating.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Low (Score = 2.5): Despite its claims, there isn't enough personal connection or strong incentive for me to make a deliberate buy.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral (Score = 3): Might give it a shot if I see discounts or reviews from trusted sources but not actively seeking it out.
   - **I will consider buying the product:** Moderate Consideration (Score = 4): The idea of improved energy and appearance is somewhat appealing, so it's in my consideration set when evaluating similar alternatives.

Overall, while aspects of the ad align with my need for efficiency as a civil servant, its generic nature and lack of standout features prevent high levels of enthusiasm or immediate purchase intent. It remains an option I might consider under certain conditions but not a priority buy.
