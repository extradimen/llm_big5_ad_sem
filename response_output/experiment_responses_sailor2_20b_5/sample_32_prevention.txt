**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning positive (4): The message is clear but not overly captivating.
  - **Interesting:** Agree-leaning (5): It's straightforward and taps into a common concern about energy levels and appearance, making it moderately engaging.
  - **Good Ad:** Strongly Agree (6): Although simple, the ad effectively communicates its purpose: preventing tiredness and dull looks, which resonates with practical concerns.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree-leaning (3): The appeal is somewhat limited; while functional, it lacks the emotional or imaginative depth that might make it truly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to Purchase this Product:** Neutral leaning negative (2): While understanding its utility, I'm not driven enough to immediately buy.
  - **Will Try to Buy this Product:** Agree-leaning (4): There's a level of curiosity and the perceived value could lead me to try it out at some point.
  - **Consider Buying this Product:** Strongly Considered (5): Despite moderate appeal, the ad does prompt consideration; it's on my radar for future purchases.

Overall, though there is recognition of its effectiveness in conveying necessity, stronger emotional engagement or additional context might enhance both attractiveness and immediate purchase intent.
