**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Like the Ad (Score 2):**
   - While I appreciate its energetic tone for staying energized, it feels somewhat generic without specific details that resonate with my personal values or daily life.

2. **Interesting (Score 3):**
   - It catches attention initially due to its promise of looking good every day but lacks compelling content or unique selling points.

3. **Good Ad (Score 4):**
   - The message is clear and aspirational, which can be positive. However, it falls short on credibility without scientific backing, personal testimonials, or specific benefits for someone in my demographic.

4. **Attractive (Score 3):**
   - It's visually appealing but not sufficiently engaging to draw me deeply into considering the product. My personality leans more towards trust and thoroughness which this ad does not adequately address.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase (Score 2):**
   - The vague promise is unlikely to push an immediate purchase decision given my budget constraints and lack of detailed assurance about effectiveness.

2. **Try to Buy (Score 3):**
   - If the price point aligns with my monthly income, I might give it a try out of curiosity but would not prioritize this over established products or services that meet daily needs more directly.

3. **Consider Buying (Score 3):**
   - There is some level of interest due to its appealing messaging, yet I will thoroughly evaluate options and seek additional reviews before making any purchase commitment.

Overall, while the ad has potential appeal, it lacks specific relevance, detailed information, and trust-building elements crucial for someone like me who values thoroughness and practicality. Thus, a moderately positive but cautious approach towards both liking the ad and considering purchasing the product emerges.
