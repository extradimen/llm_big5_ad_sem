```

**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3)**: The ad is somewhat appealing due to its energetic promise but falls short on personal resonance.
  - **Interesting (4)**: Neutral leaning towards agree; it does convey energy benefits which are attention-grabbing, though not exceptionally engaging for me personally.
  - **Good (2)**: Slightly disagreeable—while the claims seem positive, they lack specific evidence or authenticity to convince a skeptical consumer with a reserved nature and high trust skepticism.
  - **Attractive (3)**: Neutral leaning towards agree; visually appealing but doesn't stir strong emotional interest given my low confidence in quick fixes.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (1)**: Strongly disagree. The ad's general tone, combined with the lack of detailed credibility or alignment with personal preferences, does not lead me to intend purchasing.
  - **Try (2)**: Slightly agree; there might be a tiny curiosity about its effectiveness, but this is tempered by my natural caution and reserved nature.
  - **Consider (2)**: Agree. It's worth thinking over if the product gains additional endorsements or evidence, reflecting my balancing of new ideas with cautious decision-making.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s attempt to be energizing and appealing, it doesn't sufficiently resonate due to personal preferences and trust issues, leading to moderate skepticism despite some initial interest in considering.
