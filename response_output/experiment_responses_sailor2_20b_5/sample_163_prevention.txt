**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - Being talkative is not one of my traits, but I appreciate straightforward messaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score: 4) 
   - The preventative angle might appeal to my curiosity about health effects.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (Score: 5)
   - It’s effective in highlighting potential drawbacks without feeling overly dramatic, aligning with my preference for informative content.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - The negative focus ("tired and dull") may not be visually or emotionally appealing to me; I prefer more positive branding messages.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - While the ad is effective in conveying risks, my current financial constraints make it less feasible for immediate consideration.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - Lack of budget and existing alternatives prevent me from actively seeking out a new purchase.

3. **Consider buying this product:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - The information is useful, but I don’t see an urgent need given my financial limitations; it might be considered later if circumstances change.

In summary, the ad resonates well in terms of effectiveness and informativeness, yet practical constraints and preferences hinder immediate purchase intent.
