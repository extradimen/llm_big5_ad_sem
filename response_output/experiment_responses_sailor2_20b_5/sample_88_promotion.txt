**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3): The ad doesn't strongly resonate with my personal traits, so it feels somewhat indifferent but not negative.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4): It captures the essence of energizing and looking good daily, which is appealing to me as a civil servant needing sustained energy.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5): The messaging aligns well with health-consciousness and maintaining appearance, aspects I value in my balanced lifestyle.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (4): Visually or conceptually, the ad does draw attention due to its clear focus on benefits but doesn't excite me immensely.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral leaning towards Low (3): While I appreciate its message, it won’t be a priority purchase without further consideration.
   - **Try:** Slightly Higher than Neutral (2): Given my routine, trying the product might be an option if available and affordable in local stores.
   - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (5): The potential benefits are enough to keep this on my radar for future purchases or special occasions.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's focus on energy and appearance improvement, it doesn't evoke a strong impulse buy. However, it successfully positions itself as something worth considering in maintaining personal wellness— aligning with both my cautious planning approach and desire for health improvements.
