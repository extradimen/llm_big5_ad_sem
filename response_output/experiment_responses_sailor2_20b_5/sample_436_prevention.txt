**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **Like (Score: 4)**: I'm neutral-to-positive towards the ad. The prevention angle resonates somewhat but it's not overwhelmingly engaging.
    - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: It has a compelling premise about fatigue and appearance, which sparks curiosity.
    - **Good (Score: 6)**: The message is clear and impactful for people concerned with energy levels and personal presentation.
    - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While the concept is sound, it doesn’t particularly grab me visually or emotionally.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
    - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: I might not rush out to buy immediately due to budget constraints and uncertainty about its effectiveness.
    - **Try to buy (Score: 3)**: There's a mild interest, but not enough impetus yet. A trial would depend on more information or discounts.
    - **Consider buying (Score: 4)**: The ad makes me think it could be beneficial, so I'm open to considering the product in future purchasing decisions.

Overall, while there’s recognition of its potential benefits and an interesting presentation, personal circumstances and a cautious nature make the immediate purchase intention moderate. However, the ad leaves room for consideration down the line.
