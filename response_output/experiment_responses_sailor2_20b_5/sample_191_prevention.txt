**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
   - *Like*: Neutral to slightly positive (4) due to its focus on preventing tiredness and dull appearance.
   - *Interesting*: Moderately interesting but not captivating (3).
   - *Good*: Doubtful credibility, so only mildly considered good (2).
   - *Attractive*: Not visually or conceptually appealing; hence, unattractive (1).

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Low intention (2) as the ad's claim may seem exaggerated and lacks personal relevance.
   - *Will Try*: Similar hesitanceâ€”mild curiosity but not strong enough to prompt a trial purchase (2).
   - *Consider Buying*: Though it addresses common concerns, my balanced personality and cautious nature lead me only slightly toward considering purchase (2).

In summary, the ad resonates somewhat with its potential benefits but falls short in convincingly motivating immediate or strong purchasing behavior given my background and traits.
