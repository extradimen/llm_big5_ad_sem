**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3):** The claim feels a bit generic and not particularly engaging for me.
   - **Interesting (4):** It's mildly interesting but doesn't stand out much with its straightforward messaging.
   - **Good (5):** While it gets across a clear benefit, I find other ads more compelling in terms of creativity or emotional appeal.
   - **Attractive (2):** The ad lacks the visual and narrative elements that would make it appealing to me; hence, it falls on the lower side.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (1):** Given my neutral-to-negative reaction to the advertisement, I have no strong intention to buy this product.
   - **Try (2):** Despite not being convinced by the ad, I might consider sampling if prompted elsewhere or during a sale due to curiosity.
   - **Consider (3):** There's a slight possibility of considering it over time as part of my regular consumption choices but only after exploring other options.

Overall, while acknowledging the product's potential benefit, the advertisement itself does not resonate with me strongly enough to drive immediate purchase intent. It aligns more closely with consideration and cautious curiosity rather than enthusiasm or commitment.
