**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3). As a talkative and somewhat outgoing person, it catches my attention but doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm immediately.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4). The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing given my daily energy needs as a blue-collar worker.
   - **Believe It's Good:** Strongly agree (5). This aligns with the ad’s claims which seem valuable for maintaining both physical health and appearance, aspects that matter to me despite not being obsessed by them.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2). The overall attractiveness feels generic; it doesn't match my reserved nature or appeal to my specific interests.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Consider (3). While the benefits are appealing, I wouldn’t commit fully without more information on cost and effectiveness.
   - **Try:** Agree (4). Given the moderate price range of 26–35 million VND monthly, trying a sample or small package is reasonable to test its value before committing long-term.
   - **Consider:** Strongly consider (5). The balance between my need for energy boost and budget allows me to keep it in mind as an option worth exploring further.

This evaluation reflects practicality, skepticism about superficial attractiveness, while still recognizing the potential benefits of such a product.
