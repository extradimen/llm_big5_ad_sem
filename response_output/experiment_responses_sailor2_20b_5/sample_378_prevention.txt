**Evaluation:**

**Attitudes toward the Advertisement:**
- **I like the ad. (Score: 2)** - While not strongly negative, I find it somewhat dull and generic.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)** - It lacks novelty or emotional appeal that would draw me in as a blue-collar worker with limited leisure time for brand hype.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)** - On a neutral to slightly positive note, it conveys its message clearly but doesn't connect deeply due to its vague claims about tiredness and dull appearance.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)** - The appeal factor is low; it does not speak directly to my needs or emotions.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)** - Given that Iâ€™m budget-conscious with a fixed income, I'm skeptical without more tangible benefits.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)** - Mild curiosity but no strong impulse; other priorities take precedence.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)** - It's on the radar for occasional consideration if it offers practical value, otherwise not a priority.

Overall, while the ad effectively highlights an issue ("tiredness and dull appearance"), its lack of compelling personal relevance or tangible benefits limits both engagement and purchase intent in my case. Practical, targeted messages would resonate better with my demographic profile and personality traits.
