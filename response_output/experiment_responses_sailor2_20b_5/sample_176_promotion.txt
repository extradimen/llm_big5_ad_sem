**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad (3):**
  - Given my reserved nature and lack of enthusiasm for outgoing promotions, I find it mildly tolerable but not engaging.

- **I think the ad is interesting (2):**
  - The statement feels generic without specific appeals to personal needs or values. It doesn't captivate me due to its broad appeal rather than personalized benefits.

- **I believe the ad is good (4):**
  - While it seems reasonable, there's no compelling evidence of credibility or a strong connection to my daily experience as a civil servant and someone looking for energy and self-care.

- **I find the ad attractive (1):**
  - It lacks attractiveness due to its superficial promises and doesn't align with my reserved preferences. The messaging falls short in creating emotional resonance or convincing me personally.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase this product (1):**
  - Despite a strong drive for personal improvement, the ad’s generic nature fails to create urgency or trust; hence, I have no intention of purchasing immediately.

- **Will try to buy this product (1):**
  - No compelling reason exists in the advertisement to prompt me into trying it out. My cautious and thorough nature requires more specific assurances before making an attempt.

- **Will consider buying this product (1):**
  - While I appreciate new ideas, a stronger connection or detailed benefits would be necessary for consideration. The current presentation is too vague to influence my purchasing behavior. 

In summary, while there’s recognition of its potential value, the ad falls short in engaging and motivating me personally due to its lack of specific relevance and emotional appeal.
