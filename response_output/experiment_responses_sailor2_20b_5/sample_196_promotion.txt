**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - While not strongly negative, I don't find the ad particularly engaging due to its generic nature and lack of personalized appeal.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The promise of staying energized is somewhat appealing, but it doesn’t stand out enough compared to other similar offerings in the market.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - The message is clear and positive; however, it lacks depth or compelling evidence that would make me strongly believe its claims.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - I find the ad visually unremarkable and generic, which doesn’t attract my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product** (Score: 1) - Given the lack of strong emotional or logical connection with the ad, there's no immediate intention to buy.
2. **Will try to buy this product** (Score: 2) - There’s a low likelihood that I would make an effort specifically due to this ad; other factors like recommendations or personal needs might come into play instead.
3. **Will consider buying this product** (Score: 2) – Though not compelling, the promise of improved energy and appearance remains on my periphery as part of broader health routines if prompted by different means.

In summary, while I acknowledge that staying energized is important, the ad falls short in capturing my interest or convincing me to make a purchase based solely on this presentation. More personalized benefits or credible endorsements might sway my decision further down the line.
