**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: The claim of staying energized and looking good appeals moderately. However, it might seem a bit generic.
    - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's engaging but lacks novelty given how common energy drink ads are in Southeast Asia.
    - **Good (Score: 5)**: Generally positive as the message aligns with daily wellness needs, though not exceptionally persuasive for me personally.
    - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: My reserved nature makes it less appealing visually and emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
    - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: While the benefits are appreciated, personal preferences and budget constraints slightly mitigate my intention.
    - **Try to buy (Score: 3)**: Open-minded but not highly motivated; might give it a try if available nearby or on sale.
    - **Consider buying (Score: 4)**: It remains in consideration for future purchases when other options align better with my needs and financial situation.

In summary, the ad is moderately appealing due to its practical claims, but personal traits like reserve and budget limitations make me cautious about immediate purchase intent.
