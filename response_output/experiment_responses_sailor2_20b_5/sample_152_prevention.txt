   - **I believe the ad is good (good): 6** — Credible and informative; effectively highlights potential benefits by addressing common concerns.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (intend): 3** — While I understand its benefits, it's not a high priority or urgent need at the moment.
   - **Will try to buy this product (try): 3.5** — Curiosity is piqued but doesn't lead me to commit immediately; might give it a trial run if convenient.
   - **Consider buying this product (consider): 3.5** — Definitely consider including it in my shopping list, especially during periods of higher stress or when I need an extra energy boost.

Overall, the ad is effective and relevant to someone like me who values staying alert and presentable but doesn't compel a spontaneous purchase decision due to practicality and budget considerations. The scores reflect a balanced perspective driven by helpful messaging and personal alignment with lifestyle needs.
