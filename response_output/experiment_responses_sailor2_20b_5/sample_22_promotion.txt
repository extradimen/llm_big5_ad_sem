**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like**: Disagree (3) - While not strongly negative, I don't find it particularly appealing.
2. **Interesting**: Neutral to Agree (4-5) - It's mildly engaging but doesnâ€™t grab my full attention.
3. **Good**: Tilted towards Agree (5) - The message is clear and somewhat compelling for health benefits; however, personal connection isn't strong enough.
4. **Attractive**: Disagree (2) - I don't find the overall presentation or design very appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Despite recognizing its potential benefits, there's no immediate intent due to other commitments and personal preferences.
2. **Try to buy this product**: Consideration level (3) - I might give it a try if prompted by friends or during sales, but not proactively sought after.
3. **Consider buying this product**: Tilted towards Disagree (2) - While open-minded, my current priorities and budget don't align with frequent purchases of premium energy drinks.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its benefits but falls short in resonating deeply enough to drive a strong purchase decision given my reserved nature and prioritized spending. Therefore, I remain moderately engaged without a firm commitment to buying.
