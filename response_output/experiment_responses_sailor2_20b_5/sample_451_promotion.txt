**Evaluation:**
- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - The ad's messaging of staying energized and looking good resonates moderately for me. While it isn't strongly appealing due to my preference for a more reserved lifestyle, I find some value in its straightforward benefits.
  
- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - Despite not being highly motivated by the advertisement itself (score of 3), I am open to trying or considering the product based on practical needs and convenience. The focus on energy can align with my daily work demands, making a neutral-to-positive score appropriate for "intend," "try," and "consider."

Overall, while there's room for improvement in how this ad would fully engage me (lower attractiveness), I recognize its potential utility, leading to moderate purchase intention scores.
