**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)**:
   - While I appreciate its attempt to convey energy and attractiveness, it feels somewhat generic for my personal tastes.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 6)**:
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with me as a blue-collar worker; hence, it holds moderate interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**:
   - It's not groundbreaking but adequately addresses my need for practical benefits without being overly exaggerated.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**:
   - While visually appealing to some extent, it doesn’t strongly appeal given its somewhat cliché messaging and lack of unique selling points.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - The current scores for liking and interest are modest; thus, strong intent is lacking.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - There's a cautious willingness to give it a trial since I need energy boosters, but other factors like price or brand familiarity would sway the decision.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**:
   - It qualifies for consideration mainly because of its relevance to my needs and positive outlook on staying energized; however, further information is required before making a purchase decision.

In summary, while aspects of the ad appeal slightly, they do not create enough excitement or urgency. My personality traits favor practicality over immediate impulse buying, leading to moderate interest but low intention without additional compelling factors.
