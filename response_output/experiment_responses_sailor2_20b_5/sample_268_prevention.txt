**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) — The claim of feeling tired and looking dull is plausible but not inherently exciting for me.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4) — It piques my interest since I can relate to fatigue, especially balancing studies and other responsibilities.
   - **Good Advertisement**: Moderate Agree (5) — While it's straightforward, the message resonates enough without being overly manipulative. 
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (2) — The appeal isn't strong; the focus on avoiding tiredness feels somewhat generic.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase** (Neutral/Consider): I might consider it, but not a strong intent yet.
   - **Try Buying**: Agree to try once—given my lifestyle and occasional need for energy boosts, trying the product seems reasonable.
   - **Consider Buying**: Likely scenario—I am open-minded enough with financial constraints; if reviews or friends’ experiences are positive, I’ll consider making a purchase.

Overall, while there is interest in addressing fatigue, the ad must leverage more personal resonance to sway me towards an immediate buy. The moderate scores reflect cautious optimism rather than strong conviction from my personality and current situation.
