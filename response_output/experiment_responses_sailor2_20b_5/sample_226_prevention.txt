**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
  - **I like the ad (3)**: While not strongly disagreeing or disliking, it doesn't resonate deeply due to my reserved nature and emotional stability concerns.
  - **Interesting (2)**: Neutral to slightly negative because the prevention message feels somewhat generic and less engaging for me.
  - **Good (4)**: Agrees with a preventive claim, aligns with my neutral trust levels but is not compelling enough on its own.
  - **Attractive (3)**: Slightly positive; decent visual or copy design could make it attractive if better targeted.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - **Intend to purchase (5)**: Modest agreement driven by practical utility, despite some reservations about the product's necessity.
  - **Try (4)**: Agreeable; willing to give it a chance due to its perceived benefits and my tendency to plan ahead.
  - **Consider buying (6)**: Strongly agree because preventive health measures are generally valued in Southeast Asian cultures, aligning with family-oriented values.

Overall, while the ad does not strongly appeal or intrigue me on an emotional level, I am open to considering it due to its potential benefits and logical connection to my lifestyle.
