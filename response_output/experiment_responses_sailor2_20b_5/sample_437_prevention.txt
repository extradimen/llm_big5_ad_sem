**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - I like the ad (Score: 3) — Neutral; while talkative and generally trusting, its messaging feels somewhat over-the-top.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2) — Disagree; it lacks novelty for me as someone who doesn't find ads original.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 4) — Slightly Agree; prevention messages can be useful, but not compelling enough to engage deeply.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 1) — Strongly Disagree; it's neither visually appealing nor emotionally resonant with my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2) — Agree, but reluctantly. The message is informative, yet not persuasive enough considering other priorities.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2) — Neutral; it could be an impulse decision if available in store due to its convenience factor.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 3) — Slightly Agree; a balanced approach, weighing health benefits against cost and current lifestyle constraints.

Overall, the ad has some utility but doesn't strongly connect with my personality traits or daily needs. It's more about being informed rather than driven to immediate action.
