**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**: Neutral liking; while energized drinks can appeal to my active lifestyle, it doesn't resonate strongly.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**: Agreeable level of interest due to its focus on daily vitality and appearance improvement.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**: Slightly positive; the message seems well-rounded, though it doesn’t grab me intensely.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**: Disagree—lacks personal attractiveness as I'm more drawn to authenticity and relatable stories.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**: Low intention; despite needing energy, current financial constraints make a firm commitment unlikely.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**: Neutral willingness—open but not compelled due to price concerns and other priorities.
  - **Consider buying the product. (Score: 3)**: Somewhat considerate; though cautious, I acknowledge it could fit into my lifestyle if circumstances align better.

Overall, while finding some aspects appealing, practical considerations like income and personal preferences lower my enthusiasm for immediate purchase or strong intent.
