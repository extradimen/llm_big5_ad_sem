2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score: 5) - The concept of avoiding tiredness and dull looks resonates somewhat.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Disagree to Neutral (Score: 6) - It lacks strong emotional or factual appeal, so I'm cautious about its credibility.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Agree (Score: 3) - The message isn't compelling enough visually or emotionally for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Disagree (Score: 2) - While understanding the benefits, there's not strong motivation to buy.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Neutral (Score: 2) - Might give it a chance if convenience and reviews are favorable but not actively seeking it out.
