**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.* (4/7): Neutral – While not particularly disliked, it doesn't resonate strongly either given my reserved nature and tendency towards thoroughness.
   - *Interesting*: (5/7) Agree – The promise of staying energized appeals to me as a busy office worker needing sustained focus, making it engaging.
   - *Good*: (3/7) Disagree – Credibility is unclear. Requires more substantiated claims or third-party endorsements for higher trust in the benefits offered.
   - *Attractive*: (3/7) Disagree – The general attractiveness may not align with my personal aesthetic preferences and practical focus.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: (2/7) Neutral – Despite finding it interesting, there's hesitation due to lack of strong evidence for efficacy.
   - *Try to buy*: (3/7) Disagree – I'm unlikely to make an impulse decision; need further reassurance on its effectiveness and value relative to my lifestyle needs.
   - *Consider buying*: (4/7) Neutral – Open to exploring the product if more detailed information or customer testimonials are presented, aligning with a cautious approach.

Overall, while intrigued by the concept of staying energized and looking good, I require additional convincing factors before committing to purchase. The advertisement successfully catches my attention but falls short on trust and strong motivational cues for me as a thoughtful consumer.
