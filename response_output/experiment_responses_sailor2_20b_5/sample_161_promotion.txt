   - **Interesting:** (Score: 4) Neutral/Agree; The claim of "staying energized" resonates somewhat but doesn't excite me.
   - **Good Ad:** (Score: 5) Agree; It’s straightforward and relevant for busy lifestyles, but not compelling enough to strongly endorse.
   - **Attractive:** (Score: 2) Disagree; I find it less visually or conceptually appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** (Score: 6) Strongly Agree; Although not captivated by the ad, my practical needs for energy support align with this product’s benefits.
   - **Will try to buy:** (Score: 7) Strongly Agree; Given its potential utility and moderate price range, I’m motivated enough to give it a shot.
   - **Consider buying:** (Score: 6) Strongly Agree; Despite the lack of strong ad appeal, rational decision-making leads me to seriously consider adding this product.
