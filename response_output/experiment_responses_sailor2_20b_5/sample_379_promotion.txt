**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like:* Agree with being talkative but neutral on originality, so a moderate score of 5.
   - *Interesting:* Strongly agree on imagination & creativity (7), balanced by slightly lower appeal from my reserved nature (3), resulting in 4.
   - *Good:* High agreement on thoroughness and original ideas (6) makes it generally well-conceived; thus, I believe the ad is good with a score of 6.
   - *Attractive:* Strongly agree being helpful but moderately disagree on sociability when considering individual preference for reserved behavior—balancing to an average attractiveness level at 3.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend:* While I appreciate the promotion, my practicality and careful approach (Strongly Agree with thorough job) make me cautious; thus, a lower intent score of 2.
   - *Try*: The energetic benefits resonate well (Agree), but financial constraints limit immediate purchase—encouraging trial at 4.
   - *Consider:* Given the emotional stability (Agree) and active imagination, it aligns with my values to keep options open; hence a moderate score of 5 for future consideration.

Overall, while I find aspects appealing, practicality and personal habits influence cautious but positive purchase intentions.
