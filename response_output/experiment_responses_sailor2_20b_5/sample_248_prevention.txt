**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - I like the ad (3): The message seems neutral and functional but doesnâ€™t excite me.
  - I think the ad is interesting (4): It's informative but lacks engagement or creative flair for someone who prefers straightforward content over flashy ads.
  - I believe the ad is good (5): It conveys a clear benefit, which aligns with my practical outlook as a blue-collar worker seeking solutions to daily fatigue.
  - I find the ad attractive (2): The appeal isn't high; it lacks emotional resonance or relatability for me.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - I intend to purchase this product (1): While acknowledging its utility, there's no strong motivation yet to buy based on the advertisement alone.
  - I will try to buy this product (2): Mild curiosity might prompt a trial, especially if it fits within my budget and lifestyle constraints.
  - I will consider buying this product (3): The idea of feeling more energized is appealing enough to keep the option open for future consideration.

Overall, while I value its practicality and trust in benefits presented, the ad needs additional emotional connection or compelling evidence to drive a strong purchase decision.
