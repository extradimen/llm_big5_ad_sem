**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (Score: 3)  
  Neutral to slightly positive. The straightforward messaging may be adequate but not exceptionally appealing.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4)  
  Somewhat engaging, highlighting potential fatigue issues can draw initial attention.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5)  
  Moderate agreement; it effectively communicates a problem and solution but lacks emotional depth for strong engagement.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)  
  Not very appealing due to the lack of relatability with my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)
  The advertisementâ€™s message is clear but not compelling enough given my strong preference for thoroughness and trust. I need more evidence or a personal experience before committing.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)  
  Mild inclination; curiosity might push me to test the product, especially if it's affordable.

- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2)
  Open to considering but not actively planning a purchase. The appeal is insufficient given my current priorities and limited budget (<15,000,000 VND).

Overall, while I find the ad informative about potential benefits, it does not strongly influence my decision due to personal preferences for cautious behavior and skepticism towards immediate claims without additional validation or experiences.
