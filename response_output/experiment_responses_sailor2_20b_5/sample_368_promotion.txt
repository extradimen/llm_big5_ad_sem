**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like**: 
   - Given my outgoing and social nature (Strongly Agree), I appreciate engaging ads, but this one feels slightly generic.
   - Score: **3** (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)

2. **Interesting**:
   - The promise of energy and looking good is compelling for someone in their late 30s, though the claim seems somewhat expected rather than novel.
   - Score: **4** (Slightly Agree)

3. **Believe**: 
   - As I'm cautious about trusting claims without sufficient evidence (Disagree), this ad's credibility isn't fully convincing to me.
   - Score: **3** (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)

4. **Attractive**:
   - The idea of staying energized resonates, and the aesthetic appeal is decent but not particularly unique.
   - Score: **5** (Agree)

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: 
   - Although I find some aspects appealing, there are competing options in this category, so intent isn't strong.
   - Score: **2** (Slightly Agree leaning towards Neutral)
   
2. **Try to buy**:
   - While not highly motivated, curiosity might drive a trial if it fits into my routine without high investment.
   - Score: **2** (Neutral)

3. **Consider buying**:
   - The ad piques mild interest but doesn't prompt immediate action; I'll keep an open mind for future opportunities or reviews.
   - Score: **1** (Slightly Disagree leaning towards Neutral)

In summary, the advertisement is moderately engaging and attractive to me, yet falls short of strong trust or purchase intent due to its generic nature and lack of unique selling points. My cautious approach combined with balanced social tendencies results in modest scores for both attitudes and intentions.
