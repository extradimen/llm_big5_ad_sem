**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
    Neutral leaning towards liking due to the relatability of feeling tired and looking dull.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 6)**  
    Strongly agree, as the message connects with everyday experiences that resonate in a modern lifestyle.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**  
    Slightly less enthusiastic but still positive; it addresses common concerns effectively without being overly dramatic.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**  
    Moderate appeal—though impactful, the imagery or creative execution might not fully captivate me.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**  
    Neutral leaning towards low; while I appreciate its message, strong intent isn't there.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**  
    Slightly agree—openness to trying it for personal benefits despite not being highly persuaded by the ad alone.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**  
    Low, due to my generally skeptical nature and preference for products I've experienced or trusted sources recommend.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively identifies relatable issues, it lacks enough persuasive appeal in its current form to drive a strong purchase intention from someone with balanced skepticism and cautious decision-making habits like mine. An engaging follow-up campaign could potentially increase consideration levels further.
