**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards positive (score = 4) – I appreciate its energetic message but don't find it exceptionally appealing.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (score = 5) – The promise of energy and looking good is intriguing, making me pay attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (score = 6) – It seems well-crafted to address common goals like staying energized and feeling confident.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Somewhat agree (score = 3) – While engaging, it doesn't captivate me strongly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Disagree (score = 2) – I'm not committed enough to buy right away based on the ad alone.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1) – The immediate urge isn't there, so no efforts toward purchasing are likely.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (score = 3) – There's some interest, and I might look into it further if circumstances align or additional information is provided.

Overall, while the ad has a positive impact on my attitude due to its clear benefits, my direct purchase intention remains moderate to low given other factors like budget constraints and personal priorities.
