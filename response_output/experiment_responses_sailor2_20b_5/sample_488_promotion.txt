**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **Like (4)**: While I'm talkative and appreciate good messaging, this particular ad doesn't strongly resonate with me.
  - **Interesting (3)**: The promise of energy and looking best is generic; it lacks a personal connection or unique angle that would make it stand out.
  - **Good (2)**: Given my preference for thoroughness and trust in products backed by credible evidence, this ad feels superficial and lacks depth.
  - **Attractive (1)**: As someone who tends to be reserved, the promotion doesn't appeal enough; its general messaging isn’t compelling.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
  - **Intend (2)**: Although I appreciate being energized, there are many alternatives. My low trust in generic ads pushes me away from a purchase intent.
  - **Try (3)**: Neutral leaning towards Disagree—there's no strong urge to try based on this ad alone.
  - **Consider (4)**: Open but not highly motivated; I may consider it if there are specific, compelling reasons elsewhere.

Overall, the advertisement lacks personal relevance and depth, resulting in a generally negative attitude and low purchase intention.
