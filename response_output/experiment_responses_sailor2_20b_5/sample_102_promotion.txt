**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** (Score: 2) As a talkative and somewhat sociable person who values thoroughness but is also careless at times, I appreciate an energetic vibe but feel slightly indifferent because it doesn't cater directly to my day-to-day struggles.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3) It sparks some interest due to its focus on energy and appearance, which are universal needs. However, given my practical nature, it doesn’t captivate me entirely.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4) The message has merit—everyone wants sustained energy and a good look—but I’m neutral as the ad lacks specific appeal for someone in my profession or life stage.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 5) It's visually appealing, but it’s not enough to make me enthusiastic about purchasing.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 3) Given my busy blue-collar work and financial constraints (16M-25M VND/month), the perceived benefits might be worth considering.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 4) There’s a willingness to give it a shot, especially if friends or family recommend it; however, my cautious nature means I won’t rush into buying without more information.
   - **I will consider buying the product:** (Score: 6) The ad aligns somewhat with my needs for staying energized and maintaining appearance. Therefore, despite being careful, it ranks high enough to warrant consideration as a possible future purchase.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates at a moderate level due to its clear benefits, other factors such as budget constraints, practical concerns about efficacy, and personal lifestyle influence lower intent scores but leave room for potential future acquisition.
