**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** I'm somewhat neutral (5). It's not bad but doesn't excite me much.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to slightly agree (4), as it raises awareness about feeling tired and dull, which could relate to my day-to-day life.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly disagree (3). The claim feels a bit exaggerated; I don't see immediate benefits or trust in the effectiveness of this drink.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly disagree (2). It lacks personal appeal and emotional connection, especially for someone with high energy levels like me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly disagree (1). The lackluster presentation and exaggerated claims don't make it compelling.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly agree (2), only if there were better reviews or discounts available, but overall low interest.
3. **I will consider buying the product:** Disagree (1), not inclined due to doubts about its effectiveness and value for my limited budget.

Overall, while the ad somewhat addresses real issues, it fails to build strong engagement or trust necessary for a purchase decision given my demographic profile and personality traits.
