**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:** 
  - *I like the ad (2):* Despite being talkative and helpful, I find it slightly unappealing due to its overemphasis on potential negative feelings without addressing deeper needs.
  - *Interesting (3):* The message is mildly engaging but lacks emotional connection or novelty that would fully capture my interest.
  - *Good (4):* While the ad claims benefits like energy and appearance, I feel it's standard fare without compelling evidence; hence a neutral-positive evaluation.
  - *Attractive (3):* It falls short in attractiveness due to its generic tone—though not overtly unattractive, it doesn't excite me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (1):* Strongly disagree—I'm highly skeptical of such claims without substantiation.
  - *Try to buy this product (1):* Similarly, no intent to give the product a trial because I believe my current lifestyle or habits would suffice.
  - *Consider buying it (2):* Neutral leaning toward slightly positive; if there were more credible assurances and personal relevance, I might consider it but not actively pursue at present.

Overall, the ad feels manipulative rather than persuasive for someone with my personality traits. While open to original ideas, its presentation falls short in trustworthiness and compelling reasons to invest financially or emotionally.
