**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad:** Agree with some degree (Score: 4) — The message seems relevant to feeling energetic and presentable.
  - **Interesting:** Neutral leaning positive (Score: 3) — It's attention-grabbing, but not exceptionally captivating.
  - **Believe it’s good:** Somewhat agree (Score: 5) — The ad presents a clear benefit without seeming exaggerated.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree slightly (Score: 2) — While I understand the appeal, it doesn't strongly draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Neutral leaning negative (Score: 2) — The ad resonates but not enough for a strong buying intention.
  - **Will try to buy:** Somewhat inclined (Score: 3) — I might give it a chance based on the benefits mentioned.
  - **Consider buying:** Slightly more likely than not (Score: 4) — It's worth considering, especially if other factors align.

Overall, while the ad effectively highlights its core message and is somewhat persuasive, my practicality and current financial situation make me cautious about committing to a purchase. I'm open but not strongly compelled yet.
