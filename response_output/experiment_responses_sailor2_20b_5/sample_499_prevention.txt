**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** (5)
   - Neutral leaning towards slight agreement; it seems somewhat engaging but not overly appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (4)
   - Slightly agree, as the focus on fatigue relief can catch attention, but doesn't spark significant interest personally given my lifestyle and priorities.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (6)
   - Agree; effectively conveys a clear problem-solution message which is straightforward and relevant for many people.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (3)
   - Neutral leaning towards slight disagreement; lacks emotional or imaginative appeal that would truly draw me in, especially as I have strong practical leanings and minimal artistic interests.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (2) 
   - Disagree; personal habits and budget limitations mean immediate purchases for everyday energy boosts are not a priority at the moment.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (1)
   - Strongly disagree; given my monthly income constraints, trying out new products frequently is financially impractical right now.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (2)
   - Neutral leaning towards slight agreement; might be open to considering it if faced with persistent fatigue affecting daily activities or during special occasions where an energy boost could help, but not a regular purchase item at present.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively communicates its benefits and has some elements of appeal for me as someone who values straightforward solutions, my practical constraints and current priorities lead to lower intentions toward purchasing this product. The message resonates on a rational level without strong emotional pull or immediate budget fit.
