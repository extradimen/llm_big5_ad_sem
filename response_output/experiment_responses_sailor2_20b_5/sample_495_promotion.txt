**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *I like the ad (5/7):* The promotion is generally appealing to my preference for energetic and positive messaging, but I'm not overly enthusiastic.
  - *I think the ad is interesting (4/7):* It grabs attention with its promise of energy and appearance benefits. However, it might seem slightly generic in a crowded market.
  - *I believe the ad is good (6/7):* The message aligns well with maintaining wellness, which I value; thus, there's credibility here.
  - *I find the ad attractive (3/7):* While not visually striking or innovative enough to captivate me deeply, it doesn't feel unappealing either.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (2/7):* My strong focus on thoroughness and reliability means I won't impulsively buy based solely on an ad.
  - *Will try to buy the product (3/7):* There's a moderate curiosity driven by its claims, but I'd want more evidence or user reviews first.
  - *Consider buying the product (4/7):* The idea resonates slightly; it aligns with my values of health and looking good, making me open to considering if recommendations from trusted sources support this claim.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message, personal preference leans towards a cautious approach due to my trait of being thorough and not easily swayed by marketing alone. Thus, positive but measured intentions for purchasing.
