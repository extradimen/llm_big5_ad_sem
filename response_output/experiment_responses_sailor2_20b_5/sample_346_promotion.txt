**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - While not strongly positive, I find it engaging due to its focus on energy and appearance.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - The message is clear but lacks novelty or deep connection for me; thus, somewhat interesting yet average.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - The ad seems well-produced with appealing claims, though not entirely convincing given my skepticism about quick fixes.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - It's visually and conceptually okay but doesn't strongly attract me due to reserved nature and personal health-consciousness preferences.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (Score: 3)** - I'm open to the idea of trying energy drinks, but this ad alone isn’t enough for a strong purchase intent.
2. **Try (Score: 4)** - If it aligns with my current needs and budget, I might give it a try; cautiously optimistic.
3. **Consider (Score: 5)** - The product is definitely in the consideration set due to its potential benefits but not an immediate buy decision.

Overall, while this ad resonates at moderate levels and holds some appeal, additional factors—like reviews or specific health needs—would play key roles before a purchase commitment.
