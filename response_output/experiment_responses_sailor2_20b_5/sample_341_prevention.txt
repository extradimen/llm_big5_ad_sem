**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral – The statement is somewhat attention-grabbing, but it's not particularly appealing given my reserved nature.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree – It targets fatigue and appearance concerns which resonate with me as a busy office worker.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree – It effectively highlights potential negative outcomes without this drink, making its benefits clear.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly Disagree – While it's persuasive in conveying importance, I slightly prefer more engaging or emotionally resonant ads.

### Purchase Intention
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral – The argument is strong but doesn't automatically drive a decisive buy decision; other factors (like budget and convenience) matter too.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Agree – There's enough motivation from the ad for me to consider giving it a trial run, especially if fatigue has been an issue.
3. **Consider buying this product:** Strongly Consider – The compelling nature of avoiding tiredness and maintaining appearance nudges my consideration towards making a purchase once practical details align (e.g., budget compatibility).

Overall, while I'm not immediately sold on the ad's aesthetic appeal or tone, its messaging effectively addresses key concerns that could influence future purchasing behavior.
