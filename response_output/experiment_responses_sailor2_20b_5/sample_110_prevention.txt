}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Ad Type: Prevention):**
   - **Like:** Neutral to slightly positive (`3`), as it’s relevant but not overly exciting.
   - **Interesting:** Somewhat interesting (`4`) due to its clear message about fatigue and appearance.
   - **Good:** Generally considered good (`5`). The straightforward messaging aligns with practical concerns.
   - **Attractive:** Not highly attractive (`2`) since the appeal is utilitarian rather than emotionally engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Moderate intention (`4`), showing a willingness but not strong desire yet.
   - **Try to Buy:** Willingness to give it a try if needed (`3`).
   - **Consider Buying:** Open to considering the product in future scenarios (`3`). The ad resonates enough for consideration, especially under fatigue situations.

Overall, while I find the advertisement functional and effective at communicating its message, my social nature makes me slightly more open to trying products with preventive health benefits. However, it doesn’t create an urgent or compelling emotional drive that would push immediate purchase. Thus, moderate scores reflect balanced interest without high commitment.
