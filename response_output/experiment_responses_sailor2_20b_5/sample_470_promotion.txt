**Evaluation Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) – As a talkative and somewhat sociable person, the appeal isn't strongly felt but is present.
   - **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree (4) – The concept of staying energized resonates; however, it doesn’t grab my full attention.
   - **Good:** Agree (5) – I appreciate that the ad promotes a beneficial outcome for health and appearance.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – While potentially useful, its visual or emotional attractiveness is minimal due to personal preference.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral (3) – Despite not being strongly drawn in by the ad, I acknowledge its potential benefits for daily life.
   - **Try:** Somewhat Agree (4) – The idea of trying it aligns with my pragmatic approach; willing to give it a chance if convenient.
   - **Consider:** Agree (5) – Given the financial range and desire to maintain energy levels, considering purchase is rational.

Overall, while not particularly captivated by the ad’s presentation or imagery, I recognize its functional value. This results in moderate positive scores with intentions leaning towards future consideration and trial usage.
