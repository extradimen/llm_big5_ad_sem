**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - *Like (3):* Neutral. I don't find the ad particularly appealing or unappealing; it's just average.
   - *Interesting (4):* Somewhat Agree. The concept is a bit engaging but doesn’t grab my full attention.
   - *Good (3):* Neutral. It’s passable, not compelling enough to stand out as well-crafted or impressive.
   - *Attractive (2):* Disagree. While it presents an issue, the design and message lack sufficient attractiveness for me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend (1):* Strongly Disagree. Despite being aware of fatigue and dullness concerns, I don’t have a strong drive to purchase this drink.
   - *Try (2):* Neutral but leaning towards unlikely. Given my practical nature and tendency toward carelessness in planning purchases, there’s minimal incentive for trial.
   - *Consider (3):* Might Consider. The idea of feeling tired is relevant; I may entertain the thought when faced with a choice.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to personal health concerns, this ad falls short on emotional resonance and fails to strongly influence my purchasing behavior due to my reserved but sociable nature and careful spending habits.
