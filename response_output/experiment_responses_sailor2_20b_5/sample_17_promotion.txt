}

**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (score = 4):** The advertisement is somewhat appealing but not overly so due to my reserved nature and occasional need for energy boost.
   - **Interesting (score = 3):** While it holds some attention, the claims are generic enough that I don't find them exceptionally captivating or unique.
   - **Good (score = 5):** It presents a positive image of staying energized and looking good, which aligns with general health awareness; however, its overall execution feels average.
   - **Attractive (score = 3):** The ad isn’t particularly visually compelling for me. My taste leans towards more straightforward messaging over glossy visuals.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my somewhat careless and unstructured approach, I'm not highly inclined toward immediate purchase actions.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** There is a moderate likelihood of trying the product if I need an energy boost or see positive reviews from trusted sources.
   - **Consider Buying:** The concept resonates enough for me to keep it in mind as an option, especially during periods when I feel less energetic.

Overall, while not entirely dismissive, my reserved and practical nature means that the advertisement is moderately appealing but doesn’t drive a strong immediate purchase intent. My cautious yet open attitude allows room for consideration if needed.
