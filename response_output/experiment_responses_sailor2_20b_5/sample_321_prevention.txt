**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)*
   - Given my reserved and sometimes careless nature, I find this generic health concern-based ad lacking personal connection or relevance to me.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - The message about fatigue and dullness hits a basic need for energy but doesn’t stand out as engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Score = 4 (Agree)*
   - It conveys clear benefits in avoiding tiredness, which aligns with daily concerns. However, it’s straightforward rather than compelling.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Its simplicity and lack of emotional appeal or unique creativity make it unappealing for someone who appreciates originality in ads.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)*
   - While acknowledging the problem, my current budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and general tendency toward caution weigh against immediate purchases for such a claim.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - Neutral curiosity about its effectiveness might prompt me to research further before committing. However, the ad itself doesn't drive urgency or strong intent.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)**
   - Given my preference for thoroughness and planning, I am more likely to deliberate on other factors like reviews, price points, and potential long-term benefits rather than making a quick decision based solely on the ad.

In summary, while acknowledging its utility message, **the advertisement falls short in capturing my interest due to lack of personal connection, emotional appeal, or unique creativity**. Therefore, it doesn’t significantly influence immediate purchase intent but opens room for future consideration through thorough research and budget planning.
