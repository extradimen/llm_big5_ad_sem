**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: (Score = 3)
   - As someone who is generally talkative but strongly reserved, I find it mildly engaging yet not enough to evoke strong liking.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: (Score = 4)
   - The energy and appearance benefits sound appealing, making it moderately intriguing.
  
3. **I believe the ad is good**: (Score = 5)
   - It addresses common needs for daily vitality and aesthetics; hence, I find its messaging constructive but not exceptional.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: (Score = 2)
   - While the concept seems decent, my reserved nature means it doesn't captivate me visually or emotionally enough to be considered highly attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: (Score = 2)
   - My neutral outlook towards helpfulness and being a civil servant implies practicality; however, no strong desire arises from the ad alone.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: (Score = 1)
   - Given my tendency not to make plans with follow-throughs, there's little motivation for me to specifically aim at purchasing it.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: (Score = 3)  
   - The advertised benefits align somewhat with personal needs; thus, I might give the product a thought if convenience or opportunity arises without strong commitment.

In summary, while the advertisement holds some appeal due to its practical promises, my reserved and non-committal nature keeps the overall interest moderate, influencing lower scores on intention despite considering it reasonably.
