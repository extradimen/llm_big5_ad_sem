     The message about preventing tiredness and dull looks resonates somewhat; it's clear and concise.

2. **Purchase Intention**

     Neutral leaning towards slight interest; I'm open but need more information or a compelling reason.
   
   - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
     Considering my budget constraints and the current situation, trying it out is not a top priority.
