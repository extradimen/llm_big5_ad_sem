**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like the ad (Score 4):* The ad is somewhat appealing due to its straightforward messaging and direct consequences, but it doesn’t excite me strongly as a blue-collar worker with my focus on reliability and practicality.
   - *Interesting (Score 5):* The preventive message resonates because I often worry about fatigue and appearance issues. It captures my attention in an engaging way.
   - *Good (Score 6):* Given its clear, impactful claim of addressing a common issue, the ad effectively communicates value, though it's balanced by cautious skepticism.
   - *Attractive (Score 3):* While not unappealing, I find it neutrally attractive. It doesn’t hit my personal taste for creativity or originality.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase:* Although the ad is persuasive and aligns with my concerns about staying energized and looking alert (especially important in a blue-collar job), immediate intent isn't high due to budget constraints.
   - *Try to buy:* With an average income of over 46,000,000 VND, I'm financially stable enough that trying the product seems reasonable if it genuinely alleviates fatigue and improves appearance.
   - *Consider buying:* The thoroughness (Strongly Agree) in my work approach aligns with evaluating products carefully. Thus, I'll definitely consider this drink as part of managing daily stressors.

Overall, though not entirely drawn to its aesthetics or novelty, the ad effectively addresses real-life issues relevant to my lifestyle and job role, nudging me towards thoughtful consideration for purchase.
