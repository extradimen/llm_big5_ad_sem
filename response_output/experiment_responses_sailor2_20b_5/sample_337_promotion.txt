**Evaluation Details:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
1. **I like the ad (Score = 4):** Neutrally positive; finds it somewhat appealing but not overly engaging.
   
   Given my personality traits of being generally trusting and a thorough worker, I appreciate straightforward claims about energy and appearance benefits.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 5):** Agreeable interest;
 
   The concept resonates with practical needs for daily performance and looks, making it relevant to my life as an office worker aiming for efficiency.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 6):** Somewhat strong agreement;

   Its claims seem credible since staying energized aligns with maintaining productivity and health awareness common in Southeast Asian urban workplaces.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly unattractive;
   
   While functional, the overall aesthetic appeal doesn’t strongly captivate me due to my reserved nature; I prefer more straightforward visuals over flashy ones.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):** Disagree;

    Despite finding it good and interesting, there isn't a strong personal drive or immediate need right now for an energy drink with these benefits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1):** Strongly disagree;
   
   Given my current satisfaction with other products, trying this one without significant incentives doesn’t seem compelling.

3. **I will consider buying it (Score = 2):** Slightly neutral;

    If I encounter a situation where an energy boost is crucial or find attractive discounts/offers, consideration might increase but isn't guaranteed.

Overall, while the ad appeals moderately and aligns with my values, the immediate purchase intent remains low due to existing habits and preferences. It could sway me under specific conditions though, reflecting balanced evaluation rather than strong aversion.
