**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3)
   - While I appreciate that it addresses fatigue and appearance issues, which are concerns for many people, its messaging feels somewhat clich√© without compelling creativity.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly Disagree (Score = 2)
   - The claim about feeling tired and looking dull isn't groundbreaking or particularly engaging; hence, it lacks novelty.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree but with reservations (Score = 4)
   - It effectively highlights a common problem that can lead to product interest. However, its execution could be more dynamic given my preference for originality and innovation.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1)
   - The design and tone seem generic; I expect more visual appeal or unique storytelling elements considering my taste in effective marketing communication.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral with Consideration (Score = 3)
   - Addressing tiredness is a plus, but the advertisement alone isn't enough motivation to immediately make an impulse buy given other factors like personal experience and reviews.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly Disagree (Score = 2)
   - I am not driven by urgency; if I notice positive user feedback or discounts during consideration periods, then my interest might increase.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree with Consideration (Score = 5)
   - The issue of looking dull resonates somewhat as it affects confidence. If the brand provides further evidence and aligns with personal wellness goals, I'm more likely to add it to my purchase consideration list.

In summary, while there are aspects that make me appreciate its practicality, the ad needs stronger creative elements and compelling reasons beyond simple fatigue prevention to sway a strong purchase intention from someone like myself.
