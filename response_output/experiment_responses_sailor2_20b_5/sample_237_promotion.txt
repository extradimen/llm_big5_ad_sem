**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **Like (Score 3):**
  Given my reserved nature and tendency to be less talkative, the ad's energetic tone doesn't immediately resonate. It feels somewhat hyperbolic.

- **Interesting (Score 4):**
  There is an element of novelty in promising both energy and appearance benefits, which peaks curiosity but falls short due to overemphasis on superficial aspects.

- **Good (Score 5):**
  The message aligns with common wellness trends, making it generally acceptable. However, the lack of detail about ingredients or substantiated claims limits its perceived quality.

- **Attractive (Score 2):**
  My reserved and sometimes rude nature find this overly polished appeal somewhat manipulative, reducing attractiveness despite broad market targeting.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (Score 1):** 
  Despite the intriguing proposition, my strong agreement with being careless in planning makes it unlikely I would make a deliberate decision based on this ad alone. 

- **Try to buy (Score 2):**
  There's a small impulse driven by curiosity but not enough trust or confidence due to my generally disagreeing attitude towards trusting claims without evidence.

- **Consider buying (Score 3):** 
  While I might think about it, the overall impression is neutral leaning negative. The lack of comprehensive information and personal skepticism tip me towards lower consideration for purchase.

In summary, this ad appeals moderately but fails to significantly influence my purchasing behavior due to its superficial messaging and my skeptical outlook on promotional claims.
