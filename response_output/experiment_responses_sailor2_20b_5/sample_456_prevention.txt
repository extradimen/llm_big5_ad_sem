**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like**: Neutral (3). As a sociable but not overly talkative person, I find it somewhat appealing but don't feel strongly drawn to ads in general.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4). The concept of preventing fatigue and dull appearance is interesting; it resonates with everyday concerns.
  - **Good**: Agree (5). While not the most compelling ad, it effectively communicates a need for an energy drink’s benefits.
  - **Attractive**: Disagree (2). Given my tendency to be careless and lack an active imagination, I find this straightforward message less visually or emotionally engaging.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend**: Neutral (3). My neutral attitude towards the ad doesn't necessarily drive immediate purchase intent but leaves room for further consideration.
  - **Try**: Agree (4). The product's benefits align with my values of being helpful and unselfish, as it can improve daily functioning and productivity without overpromising.
  - **Consider**: Strongly Agree (5). Despite the ad’s limitations in appeal, I recognize its practicality. As a busy professional, I would evaluate whether this drink fits into my lifestyle and budget.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates moderately with me due to its functional benefits, its attractiveness could be improved for higher engagement. However, it successfully encourages consideration for potential purchase based on real needs.
