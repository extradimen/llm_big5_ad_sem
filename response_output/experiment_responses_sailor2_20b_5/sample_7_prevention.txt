**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
  - I like the ad (Score: 2): The promise of preventing tiredness and dull appearance might appeal slightly due to its practical nature.
  - Interesting (Score: 3): It's moderately interesting but lacks a strong emotional or creative hook for me.
  - Good (Score: 4): Neutral, as it seems straightforward in conveying benefits but not exceptionally compelling.
  - Attractive (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; the ad feels generic and less appealing to my tastes.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - Intent to purchase (Score: 1): I have no immediate intent given my limited budget and personal preferences for simpler, cost-effective solutions.
  - Will try to buy (Score: 2): Slightly inclined towards trying if circumstances change or there are discounts/samples available but not a high priority.
  - Consider buying (Score: 3): Low likelihood of serious consideration due to lack of strong motivation from the ad.

Overall, while understanding its purpose and potential benefits, my reserved nature and practical mindset lead me to a low evaluation of both the advertisement's effectiveness on personal appeal and subsequent purchasing behavior.
