**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (2)**: Despite being reserved and a bit cautious, I acknowledge that it's not unpleasant but falls short of my liking.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The idea of feeling tired or looking dull is relatable; however, given my modest lifestyle, the ad doesn't grab me intensely enough to be truly interesting.
   - **Good (4)**: It conveys a clear message and appears well-produced, but it doesn’t inspire strong confidence in its effectiveness for someone like me who prefers practical reassurance over flashy claims.
   - **Attractive (3)**: The visual appeal is average; the ad's attempt to connect with emotional concerns aligns somewhat with my tendency to worry, yet I find it slightly manipulative.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (5)**: While not strongly intended due to budget constraints and a preference for practical over flashy solutions, there’s enough concern about fatigue that might sway me.
   - **Try (6)**: Given my thorough work ethic and tendency to make plans, I'm inclined to give the product a try if it's reasonably priced and recommended by peers or trusted sources.
   - **Consider (7)**: The perceived benefits align with my need for maintaining energy levels, making this something worth considering in future purchases when budget allows.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself, its relevance to daily challenges creates enough consideration for potential purchase.
