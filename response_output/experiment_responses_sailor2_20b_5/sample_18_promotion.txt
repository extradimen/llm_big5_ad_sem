**Evaluation Details:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 4)**: The energy-boosting and appearance-enhancing claims appeal to my daily needs but feel a bit generic.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: While not groundbreaking, it piques mild curiosity because of its promise for everyday use.
   - **Good (Score: 3)**: Though the message is clear, it lacks depth or unique selling points that would stand out more in my mind.
   - **Attractive (Score: 6)**: The visual appeal and straightforward benefits make it somewhat attractive despite not being overly compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: On a cautious score of 2 because the ad's promises are tempting but need more detailed information about efficacy, cost, and side effects.
   - **Try to Buy (Score: 3)**: I'm open to giving it a try if available at an affordable price point within my budget range (26-35 million VND).
   - **Consider Buying**: A score of 4 indicates that while the ad doesn't seal the deal instantly, it does encourage me to think about trying this product as part of managing daily stress and energy levels.

Overall, the advertisement resonates on a practical level but falls short in compelling me strongly due to its general nature. I'm inclined toward cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
