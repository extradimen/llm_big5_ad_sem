**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - **Like (4):** While not strongly positive, it's engaging enough given my outgoing nature but doesn't fully resonate with me due to its typical energy drink claims.
   - **Interesting (5):** Agrees; I find energetic benefits and daily appearance enhancements appealing.
   - **Good (3):** Neutral leaning toward agreeable since the ad promises practical results, aligning slightly with my focus on thorough work performance but lacks originality.
   - **Attractive (2):** Slightly disagree because of its generic presentation compared to what truly attracts me personally.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3):** Neutral leaning towards not high intent; I appreciate the benefits, but other factors influence my purchasing decisions.
   - **Try (4):** Likely try it given its practical claims and relevance for daily life energy boost.
   - **Consider (5):** Will definitely consider buying since it aligns with staying productive without being impulsive.

In summary, while not overwhelmingly persuaded by the ad's presentation or visuals, the core messaging appeals to my needs as a working professional looking for effective ways to stay energized. The scores reflect balanced consideration and interest but not an immediate purchase commitment due to other personal factors like brand preference and budgeting.
