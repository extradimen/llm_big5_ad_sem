**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 5):**
   - The talkative and generally trusting traits make me moderately receptive to persuasive messages, but it's not overly engaging given my reserved nature.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
   - It taps into concerns about fatigue and appearance, which are relevant for daily life, making it somewhat appealing.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 3):**
   - Neutral on this as it sounds a bit generic; more personalized or compelling evidence would be better.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):**
   - Strongly agree to being reserved means I'm cautious about overly persuasive claims, finding it slightly unappealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):**
   - While concerned with fatigue and appearance, my strong tendency toward careful decision-making prevents immediate intent without further evidence or personal experience.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
   - Slightly higher due to agreeable traits of being thorough in work but still hesitant given the lack of compelling proof.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):**
   - I'm open-minded and emotionally imaginative, so it lands on consideration; a potential trial might be influenced by peer experiences or further credible information.

Overall, while the ad resonates somewhat with my concerns and values, its effectiveness is limited due to reservations about trustworthiness and lack of compelling detail. Therefore, scores reflect moderate interest but not strong purchase intent at this point.
