**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (2/7):** As a reserved person who doesn't enjoy being overly talkative or sociable, my initial reaction to an attention-grabbing ad is generally neutral leaning towards dislike.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The concept of avoiding tiredness and looking dull appeals slightly but isn’t captivating enough given my calm disposition.
   - **Good (4/7):** It communicates a clear benefit which aligns with self-care, somewhat convincing on an objective level.
   - **Attractive (1/7):** Finding the ad visually or emotionally attractive is low due to personal preferences and the generally serious tone of the message.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (5/7):** Despite not being fully engaged by the ad, I recognize the importance of energy levels and appearance in my role as a civil servant. This slightly nudges me towards intent.
   - **Try to Buy (6/7):** The product aligns with maintaining productivity and professional image; thus, there’s willingness to give it a try based on perceived benefits.
   - **Consider Buying (7/7):** Given my tendency for thoroughness in tasks (Strongly Agree), I will definitely consider the purchase as part of improving daily routines despite reservations about advertising style. 

Overall, while the ad might not be appealing from an emotional or social standpoint, its practicality aligns with personal needs and work responsibilities, leading to a strong consideration for potential purchase.
