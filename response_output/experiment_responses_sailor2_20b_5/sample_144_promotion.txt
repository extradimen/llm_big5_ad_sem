**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like (Score = 3):**
   - Being moderately reserved yet helpful, I appreciate the sentiment but find it slightly self-promotional.
   
2. **Interesting (Score = 4):**
   - The promise of staying energized is appealing, though its execution in the ad seems generic and not exceptionally engaging.

3. **Good (Score = 5):**
   - It's a reasonable claim about health benefits, making it somewhat credible but lacking unique value proposition details that would truly stand out to me.
   
4. **Attractive (Score = 2):**
   - The focus on looking "your best" feels superficial compared to my preference for practical and genuine product features.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (Score = 1):** 
   - Given my moderate income, lack of strong branding appeal, and personal inclination towards proven products, I have no immediate intent to purchase this.
   
2. **Try (Score = 1):**
   - Low desire to experiment due to unconvincing messaging and limited trust in the product's effectiveness from a quick ad.

3. **Consider (Score = 2):** 
   - A neutral inclination towards consideration if I encounter more substantial evidence or reviews, but not enough incentive based on this ad alone.

Overall, while I recognize its potential benefits, my cautious nature and need for more compelling information outweigh the brief promise conveyed by the advertisement.
