**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad (`2`/Neutral): The claim is straightforward but doesn't resonate emotionally.
  - I think the ad is interesting (`3`/Slightly Agree): It's mildly engaging, focusing on a common issue of fatigue and appearance.
  - I believe the ad is good (`1`/Strongly Disagree): Given my preference for more creative ads and skepticism toward health claims without strong evidence, it lacks credibility.
  - I find the ad attractive (`4`/Agree): Slightly appealing due to its relevance but not highly so.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (`1`/Strongly Disagree): Despite acknowledging a need for energy and appearance, my financial constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) and lack of trust in the claim keep me from intent.
  - I will try to buy this product (`2`/Disagree): Mild consideration due to necessity but low confidence in efficacy and budget limitations.
  - I will consider buying this product (`2`/Disagree): The ad sparks some thought, especially if there's a sale or lower price point, but the overall skepticism and current state of finances discourage immediate action.

Overall, while I recognize the potential benefits addressed by the ad, my personality traits (reserved, untrusting, sometimes rude) coupled with financial constraints lead to moderate disinterest and low purchase intent.
