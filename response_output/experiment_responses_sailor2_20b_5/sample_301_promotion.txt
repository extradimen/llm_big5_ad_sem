**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** 2 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)
     * As someone who is reserved and emotionally stable by default, I find the energy claims somewhat appealing but not exciting enough.
   
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** 3 (Somewhat Agree)
     * It touches on common desires for energy and appearance enhancement, which are generally relevant themes.

   - **I believe the ad is good:** 4 (Neutral leaning towards Agree)
     * The concept is okay, but I lack trust in such claims without more concrete evidence or personal experiences.
   
   - **I find the ad attractive:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
     * Given my reserved nature and sometimes rude demeanor (if provoked), visual aspects and catchy slogans may not attract me.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
     * My strong tendency towards carelessness, lack of thoroughness in evaluating products, and skepticism about the claims make it unlikely I will commit to a purchase right away.
   
   - **I will try to buy this product:** 2 (Disagree)
     * While not completely ruling out trying once, my general cautious approach means initial interest is low.

   - **I will consider buying this product:** 3 (Neutral leaning towards Agree)
     * The idea of looking good and being energized might prompt consideration if I come across the product again in a more familiar or less stressful setting. However, it's not a priority given my current lifestyle and priorities as a civil servant.

Overall, while there is some recognition of the adâ€™s relevance, personal traits like reserve, skepticism, and carelessness contribute to low engagement and purchase intent for this energy drink promotion.
