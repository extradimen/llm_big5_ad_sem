**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** Agreeable but not strongly so due to a neutral-to-disagree tendency towards being emotionally stable.
     *Score: 6*
   
   - **Interesting:** The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing, aligning with strong agreement on being helpful and unselfish (health-conscious).
     *Score: 5*

   - **Good Advertisement:** While the core message resonates, concerns about thoroughness and carelessness slightly dampen its perceived quality.
     *Score: 4*
   
   - **Attractive:** The overall aesthetic appeal might be average; my strong agree on having an active imagination balances with my careless nature.
     *Score: 3*

2. **Purchase Intention (Scores):**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Despite liking and finding the message good, past tendencies towards carelessness lower this score significantly.
     *Score: 2*
   
   - **Try Buying it:** A cautious consideration emerges due to balanced interests in health and beauty products but with reservations about reliability.
     *Score: 3*
   
   - **Consider Buying:** There's a willingness to think through the purchase, influenced by the adâ€™s positive aspects while acknowledging my more variable attitudes towards commitment and planning.
     *Score: 4*

In summary, though I appreciate the energy and appearance benefits highlighted in the ad, personal habits (carelessness) and moderate engagement with detailed plans make me cautious. This results in a mix of interest but tempered intent to buy.
