**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
- **Like (Score 3):** Neutral to mildly negative; The ad's straightforward message feels somewhat generic for me.
- **Interesting (Score 4):** Moderately interesting; It effectively highlights potential drawbacks, but doesn't spark excitement or novelty.
- **Good (Score 2):** Below average; Lacks depth and creativity given my background in a postgraduate field where I expect more sophisticated messaging.
- **Attractive (Score 1):** Not attractive; The overtly negative framing feels manipulative rather than appealing, aligning poorly with my reserved nature.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to Purchase:** Moderate consideration (2); While acknowledging the product's potential benefit in preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it doesn't inspire a strong desire.
- **Try Buying:** Consider trying (3); There is some curiosity due to its relevance but not enough personal connection or trust in the ad.
- **Consider Buying:** Slightly likely (4); Given my monthly income range and occasional need for energy boosts, I am open to considering it despite reservations about the promotional style.

Overall, while there's a minimal appeal based on practical benefits, the ad falls short due to its manipulative tone and lack of alignment with my personality traits. Thus, the scores reflect cautious consideration rather than strong intent or attraction.
