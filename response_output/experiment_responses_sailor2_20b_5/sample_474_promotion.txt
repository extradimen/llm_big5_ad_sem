**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (Score: 3):** Neutral to slightly positive. The language and promise of energy and appearance appeal somewhat but may not fully resonate due to my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4):** Slightly agree. It has attention-grabbing elements, but it's generic enough that it doesn't uniquely stand out for me.
  - **Good (Score: 5):** Neutral leaning towards positive. The ad communicates benefits effectively but does not evoke strong enthusiasm.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** Strongly disagree. As a reserved person, I find the presentation overt and slightly overpromising.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my preference for careful planning and considering practical needs, there isn't enough convincing evidence or personal relevance here.
  - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Slightly agree. There's a curiosity driven by the claims but not strong enough intention due to general cautiousness about new products.
  - **Consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards mild consideration. While it doesn't compel immediate action, I might think about it after further information or reviews.

Overall, while there are some positive aspects, my reserved and thorough nature combined with concerns over effectiveness lead to a cautious evaluation of the ad's impact on my purchase intention. The scores reflect a balance between slight interest and practical restraint.
