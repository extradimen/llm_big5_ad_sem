**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4/7):** The ad resonates somewhat due to its straightforward message about feeling tired and looking dull, but it doesn't excite me strongly as a talkative yet reserved individual.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** Neutral leaning towards mildly interesting; the concept is clear enough for understanding without being groundbreaking or engaging.
   - **Good (5/7):** The ad effectively communicates its benefit in preventing fatigue and dull appearance, which aligns with my goal-oriented nature. I find it sufficiently informative.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** Despite strong agreement on trustworthiness and thoroughness, the overall presentation lacks personal appeal for me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Although the message is credible, my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make a strong purchase intent low.
   - **Try (3/7):** There's moderate curiosity and openness to giving it a try if available at an affordable price point.
   - **Consider (4/7):** I'll keep the product in mind; its potential benefits align with my desire for better self-care without immediate commitment.

Overall, while the ad is serviceable and truthful, personal preferences toward social interaction (disagree being outgoing) and financial limits reduce strong engagement or immediate purchase intention.
