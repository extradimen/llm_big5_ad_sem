**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 3):** The ad's messaging feels generic and doesn't particularly resonate with my personal preferences or lifestyle.
    - **Interesting (Score: 2):** It’s not compelling enough to capture my attention given my lack of outgoing nature and focus on practicality over appearance.
    - **Good (Score: 4):** I see the ad as functional, but it doesn’t inspire strong positive emotions due to its broad appeal. 
    - **Attractive (Score: 3):** It’s neutral in terms of attractiveness; not enough to stand out positively or negatively.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score: 1):** Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and a conservative spending mindset, I am unlikely to commit fully to buying this product.
    - **Try (Score: 1):** There’s little incentive for me to try the drink since it doesn't align with immediate needs or interests.
    - **Consider (Score: 2):** While not dismissive, the ad won’t prompt serious consideration; I might look into cheaper alternatives or other essentials first.

Overall, the advertisement seems unconvincing and irrelevant to my current priorities. The lack of specific appeal combined with practical financial limitations means it scores low on both attitude and purchase intention scales for me personally.
