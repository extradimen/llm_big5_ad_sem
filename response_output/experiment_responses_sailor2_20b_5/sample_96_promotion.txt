**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 4 (Agree)*
    - As a reserved but not overly sociable person, while I might find some aspects of energy drinks appealing, the overall presentation doesn't grab my attention strongly.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 3 (Neutral)* 
    - It's mildly engaging, but without specific resonance or excitement for staying energized and looking good, it feels average rather than compelling.
3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
    - The message seems too broad and lacks details that might appeal to my practical nature as a blue-collar worker with limited free time for self-care routines.
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* 
    - Given my tendency towards being reserved, I'm not drawn by flashy or overly promotional content. The focus on appearance isn't particularly relevant to my daily priorities.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
    - My financial constraints and the lack of alignment with my values make me highly unlikely to invest in a drink solely for these benefits.
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* 
    - With limited disposable income, I have no incentive to experiment on something that doesn’t directly address practical needs like energy for work or health concerns.
3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
    - The ad's promises don't resonate strongly enough; my current budget and lifestyle make it an impractical choice, so I won't even give serious consideration.

In summary, the advertisement falls short in capturing both personal interest and practical relevance for me. My conservative approach to spending means this product wouldn’t be on my radar despite its claims of benefits.
