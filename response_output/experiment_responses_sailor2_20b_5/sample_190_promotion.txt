   - *Believe the ad is good (6):* The promise of staying energized resonates with maintaining productivity, making me think positively about its claims.
   - *Attractive (4):* While not entirely unattractive, it lacks strong visual or emotional appeal to really draw me in deeply.

   - *Intend to purchase this product (3):* I appreciate the benefits but haven’t reached a firm commitment yet due to other budget considerations and existing routines.
   - *Will try to buy this product (2):* There’s mild curiosity, but it's not urgent enough for me to actively seek out or plan to buy it immediately.
   - *Consider buying this product (3):* It is on my radar as a possible option if I notice improvements in energy levels and confidence from others who use it.
