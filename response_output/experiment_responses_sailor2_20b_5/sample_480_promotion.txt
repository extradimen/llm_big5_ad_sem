**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**: 
   - **Like (3)**: While I appreciate the concept of a drink that promises energy and appearance benefits, my reserved nature means it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (4)**: The message is interesting due to its focus on daily wellbeing; however, it’s not compelling enough given my preferences.
   - **Good (5)**: I acknowledge the ad's intention to promote a useful product and can appreciate that aspect from an analytical standpoint, despite personal reservations.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Given my reserved personality, the overall appeal of the ad feels somewhat lacking.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend (2)**: Despite being aware of its potential benefits, I'm not highly motivated to purchase right now due to my cautious nature and ongoing commitments.
   - **Try (3)**: There’s a mild curiosity that might lead me to consider sampling the product if it's available or recommended by trusted sources.
   - **Consider (4)**: Given the thorough job requirement trait, I’m open-minded enough to keep this option in mind for future needs or special occasions.

Overall, while my personality and values don't strongly align with the advertisement’s energetic pitch, there is a middle ground of cautious consideration. The product might appeal more under specific circumstances but doesn’t elicit immediate purchase intent based on current feelings.
