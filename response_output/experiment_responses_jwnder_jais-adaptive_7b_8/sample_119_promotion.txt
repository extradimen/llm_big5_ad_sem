 The ad is not very appealing to me and does not make me want to buy the product. It seems like a normal advertisement that tries to convince people to buy their product by saying it helps them look their best and stay energized. However, I do not believe this drink would help me achieve these goals. Therefore, my attitude towards the ad is neutral (score 4).

Regarding my purchase intention, I do not have any intention of buying this product. While I find the product interesting and may even consider trying it out at some point in the future, there are many other drinks on the market that can help me stay energized and look good without spending money on this one (score 3).

Overall, I think the ad is not very effective because it does not target its audience well. The message of the ad may appeal to some people who want a quick fix for their energy levels or appearance, but others like me will find it unpersuasive and not worth buying (score 4).
