 Here is a sample response to the given question:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [5, 4, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 3.5, 3]
}
```

In this response, the score of 1 for `like` represents that the advertisement is neither liked nor disliked by me, and similarly, the scores for other questions are also determined based on my personal feelings towards them. The purchase intention score is lower as I might not be interested in buying the product but would still consider trying it out. This response follows a critical evaluation of the ad, keeping in mind my personality traits and demographic profile.
