 Here's an example of how I would answer the questions as a virtual assistant. Please note that this is just an example and not the actual output of a real chatbot. Also, please replace "you" with "I" to get the appropriate response for an AI-powered chatbot:

First, your **attitude toward the advertisement**: 
1. I like the ad. - Score: 7
2. I think the ad is interesting. - Score: 6
3. I believe the ad is good. - Score: 5
4. I find the ad attractive. - Score: 7

Second, your **purchase intention**: 
1. I intend to purchase this product. - Score: 5
2. I will try to buy this product. - Score: 4
3. I will consider buying this product. - Score: 3
