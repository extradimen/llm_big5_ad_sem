 Here is the JSON output for your task:
```
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [6, 5, 4, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 1, 0]
}
```
This JSON represents your responses to the questions asked in the task. The values are scored on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is strongly disagree and 7 is strongly agree. For instance, for the question about the ad's attitude scores, you responded with: "I like the ad" which gets a score of 6. The same logic applies to the purchase intention questions as well. In this case, you indicated that you will "consider buying this product", and hence the answer is scored as 0.

The final output shows your responses for each question in the form of a JSON object with two keys - 'ad_type' and 'score'. The value for each key represents your score on the respective question. For example, the value '6' indicates that you strongly agree with the statement "I like the ad".

This format allows for easy processing and analysis of your responses by a machine learning algorithm or a human analyst.
