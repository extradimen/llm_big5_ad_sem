 The ad does not appeal to me. It is rather dull and generic, and I don't see any connection between the product and its benefits. Therefore, my attitude towards this ad is:
1. Like - 3/7
2. Interesting - 4/7
3. Good - 5/7
4. Attractive - 6/7

As for my purchase intention, I am not interested in buying this product. My scores are:
1. Intend - 0/7
2. Try - 2/7
3. Consider - 3/7

Therefore, the JSON format would be:
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [0, 2, 3]
}
