 As a blue-collar worker, I have very little money to spend on fancy drinks. The ad makes the product seem luxurious and unnecessary, which makes me think it's not for someone like me. However, I can see why some people might be attracted to it because of its glamour. In terms of purchase intention, I would only consider buying it if I had more money or needed energy to perform my job better.
