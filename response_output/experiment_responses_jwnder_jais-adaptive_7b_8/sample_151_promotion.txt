 Here is an example of how you can answer the question:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}

In this example, the user thinks highly of the ad and considers purchasing it, but is not necessarily sure if they will actually make a purchase. The scores are based on the user's own opinion and may vary from person to person.
