In this example, the ideal virtual assistant is a male blue-collar worker in their 40s with a postgraduate degree. They are outgoing and sociable, which may make them more open to advertising messages that appeal to those personality traits. However, they do not necessarily feel the need or desire to purchase any products advertised in this way.

The assistant scores the first three items in their attitude towards the advertisement as follows: like - 7 points, interesting - 6 points, good - 5 points. This shows that while they find the ad attractive and consider it to be of quality, they do not necessarily agree with all its claims or messages.

The purchase intention scores are as follows: intend - 6 points, try - 5 points, consider - 4 points. These scores indicate that the assistant is only slightly interested in buying this product. They might think about it but ultimately decide against making a purchase based on other factors (e.g., price, quality, availability).

Overall, the assistant has mixed feelings towards the ad and shows little interest in purchasing any products advertised through it.
