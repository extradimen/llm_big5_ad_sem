 As an AI model, I do not have personal feelings or preferences. However, based on the information provided, I can analyze the advertisement objectively and provide a response accordingly. Here is my evaluation:

First, let's consider the attitude toward the advertisement. The ad claims that the product can help prevent feeling tired and looking dull. As an individual who values being active, alert, and well-rested, I would likely find this claim appealing. However, I might also be skeptical about the effectiveness of the product due to the general lack of scientific evidence supporting such claims in advertisements. Therefore, my scores for the ad attitude would be:

1. I like the ad. - 4
2. I think the ad is interesting. - 3
3. I believe the ad is good. - 5
4. I find the ad attractive. - 6

Next, let's consider the purchase intention. The advertisement suggests that by drinking this product, consumers can avoid feeling tired and looking dull. However, as an individual who values health and wellness, I might be skeptical about the effectiveness of the product, given that there is no evidence to support its claims in scientific literature. Moreover, I do not currently have a need for such a product due to my active lifestyle and good sleep habits. Therefore, my scores for purchase intention would be:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - 0
2. I will try to buy this product. - 3
3. I will consider buying this product. - 4

In conclusion, while the advertisement is interesting and somewhat believable, it lacks credibility due to a lack of scientific evidence supporting its claims. As such, my purchase intention is low, reflecting a skeptical response to the ad.
