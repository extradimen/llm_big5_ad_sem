 The advertisement seems manipulative as it uses fear to persuade the target audience. I do not like the ad and will not buy the product. Therefore, my scores are 1 for "I like the ad" and "I think the ad is interesting", and 3 for "I believe the ad is good" and "I find the ad attractive".

As for my purchase intention, I do not intend to purchase this product, so I will score it 1.
