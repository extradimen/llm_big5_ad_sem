  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 3, 3]
}
```
In this response, I have rated the ad as 'like' (score 4), indicating that the ad is interesting to me. The score of 5 for being 'interesting' suggests that while the advertisement might be well-crafted and creative, it does not evoke a strong emotional response in me. I scored it as 'good' with a score of 6, which means that I believe the ad is truthful and realistic, but I am not convinced to buy the product after watching it. Finally, I rated the advertisement as being 'attractive' (score 7), indicating that despite its good qualities, it fails to make me want to purchase the product.

Regarding my purchase intention, I scored it at 3 for both 'intend' and 'try', which means that although I find the advertisement interesting and consider it to be well-crafted, I do not intend or plan on buying the product anytime soon. However, I will try it out if given an opportunity.
