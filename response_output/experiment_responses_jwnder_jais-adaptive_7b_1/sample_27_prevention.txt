 The given advertisement states that without the drink, one may feel tired and look dull. I disagree with this statement because being tired or looking dull is a natural part of life and can occur even if one doesn't consume the product. Therefore, my attitude toward the advertisement is Neutral (score 3).

As for my purchase intention, I am not likely to buy the product because it seems irrelevant to me. Therefore, my score for this question is 1.
