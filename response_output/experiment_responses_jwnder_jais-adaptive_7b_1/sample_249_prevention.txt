 The ad is a prevention-focused advertisement. It targets people who may feel tired and look dull if they do not consume the drink in question. The ad attempts to persuade viewers that by consuming the product, their energy levels will be increased, and they will appear more vibrant.

I like the ad: 7
I think the ad is interesting: 6
I believe the ad is good: 5
I find the ad attractive: 4

The ad makes me feel energetic and youthful. It appeals to my emotions and creates a desire in me to look better and feel more alive. The product's benefits are clearly stated, but I don't need this particular drink to improve my energy levels. Additionally, I am skeptical about the claims made by the ad, as it seems too good to be true.

I intend to purchase this product: 3
I will try to buy this product: 4
I will consider buying this product: 5

While I think the ad is interesting and appealing, I am unlikely to actually purchase this product. There are other products on the market that can provide similar benefits without such a high price tag. Also, my values as a consumer prioritize safety and trustworthiness over advertising claims. I believe that companies should be honest about their products' effects rather than exaggerating them for the sake of selling more product.
