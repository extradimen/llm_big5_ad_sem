  Here is an example of how you might answer this question:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
In this example, the score for attitude towards the ad is 4 (like) and the score for purchase intention is 3 (consider).
