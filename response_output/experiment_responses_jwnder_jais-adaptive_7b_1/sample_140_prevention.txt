 Here is a sample response for the given prompt:
```
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": {
    "like": 6,
    "interesting": 7,
    "good": 7,
    "attractive": 7
  },
  "purchase_intention_scores": {
    "intend": 7,
    "try": 5,
    "consider": 4
  }
}
```
In this response, I have scored the ad positively on all four attitude and purchase intention questions. This is because as an older male with a bachelor's degree who values helpfulness and honesty, I find the advertisement about a drink promising restfulness and clear-looking skin to be appealing. While I may not necessarily intend to buy it myself at this point in time due to my financial situation or other factors, I could see myself trying out this product if it were available within my budget.
