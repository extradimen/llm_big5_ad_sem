 The advertisement is not targeted to me as I do not need an energy drink. Moreover, the ad is not interesting or appealing to me due to its generic claim about staying energized and looking good. Therefore, my attitude toward this ad is negative with scores of 1 for like, interesting, good, and attractive. In addition, I don't intend to purchase this product so my purchase intention score will be 1 as well. Finally, my overall rating of the advertisement is 2.
