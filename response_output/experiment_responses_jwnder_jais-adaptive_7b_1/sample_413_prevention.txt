 As an AI language model, I don't have personal feelings or emotions. However, based on the information provided about my demographic profile and personality traits, here is how I would evaluate this advertisement as if I were a real person:

Firstly, regarding the ad's **attitude**:
1. The ad is interesting to me because it emphasizes a common problem (feeling tired and looking dull) that many people might relate to.
2. While I believe the ad is good in terms of its message, I don't find it particularly attractive or appealing.
3. I am not sure if I would consider it an "attractive" advertisement since my personality traits make me more cautious about buying things, especially new products.

Secondly, regarding the ad's **purchase intention**:
1. Even though the product sounds promising, I am not sure if I would intend to purchase it right away due to my current financial situation and personal preferences.
2. I may try to buy this product if it is available at a reasonable price and has good reviews from other consumers.
3. Considering that I am a student with limited budget, I will probably not consider buying the product unless there are special offers or discounts.
