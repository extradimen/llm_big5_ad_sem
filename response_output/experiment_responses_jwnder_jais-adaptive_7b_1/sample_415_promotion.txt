 Here's an example of how you can format your response based on the given instructions:\n\n```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [5, 7, 6, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
In this example, the user gave a score of 5 for liking the ad, 7 for finding it interesting, and 6 for thinking that it's good. They also scored their purchase intention lower, giving a score of 4 to find the product attractive. The final result is represented in JSON format, where each value is assigned a numerical score between 1 and 7.""
