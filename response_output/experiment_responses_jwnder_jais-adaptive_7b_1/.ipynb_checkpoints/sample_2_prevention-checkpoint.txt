 The ad type is prevention. I like the ad because it's informative and tells me about the product's benefits without being too pushy. It's interesting because it targets a specific audience (older adults) and tries to solve their problems (tiredness and dullness). However, I don't think the ad is good since it seems like an attempt to sell something rather than helping me with my problem. The ad isn't attractive; instead, it looks like a regular commercial that tries to convince me of buying something.

As for purchase intention, I intend to purchase this product because I understand its purpose and need (to be more alert). I will try to buy it since I'm interested in solving my problem but not sure if I trust the advertisement completely. Lastly, I will consider buying this product only if I find a better one elsewhere or if this one doesn't work for me.
