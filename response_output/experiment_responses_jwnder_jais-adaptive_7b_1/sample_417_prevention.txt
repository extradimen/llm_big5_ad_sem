 Here's an example of how you could format the JSON response for this task:

{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3,4,5,6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [7,7,7]
}
This would mean that the user found the ad interesting and attractive, but didn't find it very good. They also intended to purchase the product, tried to buy it, and considered buying it in the past.
