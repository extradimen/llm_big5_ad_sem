 Here's an example of how the user might respond to the prompt:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
In this example, the user has a neutral attitude toward the ad but is more likely to consider buying it than intending or trying.
