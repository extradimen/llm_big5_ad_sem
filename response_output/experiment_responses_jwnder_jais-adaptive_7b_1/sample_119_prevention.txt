 Here is the output of this example for me as a virtual assistant. Notice that I have filled in my responses as if I was an ideal consumer based on my demographic profile and personality traits:

{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 7, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [5, 6, 7]
}

Notice that I rated the ad as "interesting" and "good" because it appealed to me based on my personality traits. However, my purchase intention is only slightly higher than my attitude score for this product since I don't actually need or want this type of drink.
