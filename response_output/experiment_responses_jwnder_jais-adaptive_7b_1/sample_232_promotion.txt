 I am a virtual assistant, and I don't have personal feelings or opinions. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the advertisement as if I were a real person or ideal consumer. However, I can provide you with a general answer based on common human behavior towards such ads.

First, your attitude toward the advertisement: 
1. I like the ad (5): The advertisement uses positive language and appeals to people who value staying energetic and looking their best every day. It is likely to be appreciated by a wide audience.
2. I think the ad is interesting (6): The drink's benefits are clear, but some people might not find them compelling or believable.
3. I believe the ad is good (4): The ad provides enough information about the product and its benefits to be effective, but it could improve by showcasing the product in use or including testimonials from satisfied customers.
4. I find the ad attractive (7): With a catchy tagline and visually appealing graphics, this ad has potential to grab attention and generate interest among its target audience.

Second, your purchase intention: 
1. I intend to purchase this product (3): The ad does not provide enough information about the product's price or where it can be purchased. Without that knowledge, people may not feel confident making a purchase decision.
2. I will try to buy this product (4): If the product is widely available and reasonably priced, some consumers might give it a shot after seeing the ad.
3. I will consider buying this product (6): This score indicates that most people would be open to trying the product if they learned more about its features and benefits.
