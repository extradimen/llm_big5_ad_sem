 The given advertisement is neither persuasive nor unappealing. It doesn't resonate with me as I am not looking for an energy drink that would help me stay energized and look good every day. I do not have any artistic interests, so the product does not appeal to me on that basis either. While it seems like a healthy option compared to sugary drinks, I don't think it is worth buying due to my personal preferences. Therefore, I will score all questions 1 (strongly disagree) except for "I intend to purchase this product", where I will score it 4 (neutral).
