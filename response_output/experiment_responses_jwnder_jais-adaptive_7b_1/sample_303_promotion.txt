 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model I don't have the ability to view or analyze advertisements. However, based on my programming and understanding of human behavior, it is possible to score these questions hypothetically.  Please enter your responses below:
```
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 7, 7, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 4, 6]
}
```
