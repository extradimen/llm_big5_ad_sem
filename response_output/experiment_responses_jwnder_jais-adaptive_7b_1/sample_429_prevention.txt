 The ad type is prevention. Here are my scores:

  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}

I like the ad. I think it is interesting and good. However, I find it not very attractive or convincing. Therefore, my attitude toward the advertisement is mixed. Although I believe in preventing tiredness and dullness, which are essential for a healthy lifestyle, I am doubtful about this product's effectiveness and credibility, as there are no scientific evidence to support its claims.

Moreover, my purchase intention is low. Even though the ad is interesting and informative, it does not persuade me enough to consider buying the product or even try it out. In fact, I don't even know what this drink is, where it comes from, or how it works. This lack of information makes me feel uneasy about its safety and effectiveness. Therefore, I will probably not buy this product or recommend it to anyone else.
