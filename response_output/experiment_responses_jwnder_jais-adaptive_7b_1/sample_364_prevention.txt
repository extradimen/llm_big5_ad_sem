 The first thing I noticed about the ad was that it said "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This immediately made me think of myself, since I am a very active person who likes to be energetic and lively.

The second thing I noticed was that the ad showed people who were feeling healthy and looking good after consuming the product. At first glance, this made me feel like I could benefit from using the drink as well. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that these people may be actors or models hired specifically for the purpose of promoting the product. This made me suspicious of the ad's authenticity.

As a result, my attitude towards the advertisement is lukewarm at best. While it did catch my attention initially, I am now skeptical about its effectiveness and do not feel motivated to purchase it. Furthermore, while the product seems to promise an increase in energy levels, I have concerns over whether or not this can be achieved naturally through exercise and a balanced diet. Overall, I find that the ad is intriguing but ultimately unconvincing.

In terms of purchase intention, my score is 3 out of 7. This reflects my belief that while I am open to trying out new things, there are many other factors at play in terms of what makes a product worth purchasing. For example, price and availability are important considerations for me when making buying decisions.
