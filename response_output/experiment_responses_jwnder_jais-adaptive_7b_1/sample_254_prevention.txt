 Here is a sample response to the question:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 4, 4]
}
```
In this response, the user likes and thinks the ad is good (scored 4), but they are unsure whether to buy it or not, so they scored their purchase intention as "consider" (score 3).
