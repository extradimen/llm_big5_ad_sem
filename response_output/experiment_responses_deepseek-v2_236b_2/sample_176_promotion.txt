Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. The ad is somewhat attractive (score 5) as it promises energy and looking one's best, which could appeal to my demographic profile that includes being young and potentially concerned about appearance and performance in my civil servant role. However, I am not particularly outgoing or sociable, so the idea of staying energized for social reasons does not strongly resonate with me (score 2). The ad is interesting enough (score 4) but not necessarily good in my opinion as it lacks personal relevance to some of my traits such as being reserved and having few artistic interests (score 2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite the neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement, my purchase intention is low. As a civil servant with a lower monthly income, I am likely more budget-conscious, which could affect my willingness to try new products that might not be essential (score 1). However, if there was significant peer influence or perceived value in improving work performance, I might consider buying the product (score 3), but it is not something I intend to do immediately (score 1).
