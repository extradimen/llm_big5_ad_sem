Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately likeable (3), somewhat interesting (4), not particularly good but acceptable (2), and relatively attractive (5). The ad's claim about energy and appearance is appealing to a certain extent.
- Purchase intention: While the ad has some appeal, my intention to purchase the product is low (1) as I might try it out of curiosity (2), but considering buying it would depend on further information or recommendations (3).
