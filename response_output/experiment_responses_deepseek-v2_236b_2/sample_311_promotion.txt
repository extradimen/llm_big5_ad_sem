In this response, I've indicated that while the ad is somewhat attractive and good (scoring a 5 on being good and a 6 on being attractive), it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally. However, it does hold some interest (4 on interesting) and is liked to an extent (3 on like). As for purchase intention, I am considering buying the product (score of 5 on consider), but there isn't a strong intent to immediately buy or try the product right away (scores of 2 and 3 respectively).
