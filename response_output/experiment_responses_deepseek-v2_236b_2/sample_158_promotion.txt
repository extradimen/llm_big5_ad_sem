Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it aligns with my need for energy and appearance. However, while I think it's interesting enough to catch my attention (score 5), I don't fully believe in its claims as being universally good for everyone (score 3). My agreement on liking the ad is moderate (score 4), reflecting a cautious interest rather than strong enthusiasm.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding some appeal in the ad, my intention to purchase the product is low (score 1) due to skepticism and personal preferences that may not align with the advertised benefits. I might try it if there's an opportunity or promotion (score 2), but overall, I would consider buying it only after more information and consideration (score 4).
