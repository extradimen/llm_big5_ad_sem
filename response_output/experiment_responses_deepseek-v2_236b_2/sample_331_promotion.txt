Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude:** As a sociable and outgoing person who values trustworthiness and helpfulness, the advertisement's claim to help stay energized and look one's best is somewhat appealing. The ad seems interesting (score 6) as it aligns with my desire to be at my best for social interactions. It is perceived as good (score 5) but not overly attractive (score 4), perhaps because of the lack of details on how exactly it achieves these benefits.
- **Purchase Intention:** While the ad captures some interest, there's a skepticism about its claims due to being emotionally stable and sometimes skeptical about thoroughness in advertising. Therefore, while I might consider buying the product (score 3), there is not a strong intention to immediately purchase or try it out at this moment (scores 1 and 2).
