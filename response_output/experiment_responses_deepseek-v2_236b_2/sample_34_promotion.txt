Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: While I find the ad to be somewhat attractive and interesting due to its promise of energy and looking one's best (which is appealing at any age), it doesn't fully resonate with my personal values or lifestyle. As a high school educated, blue-collar worker in his 60s, I am more focused on practical benefits rather than "looking my best," which might be less relevant to me at this stage of life. However, the promise of energy could be appealing for someone who is still actively working and needs that boost during the day.
  
- Purchase intention: The ad does not strongly convince me to intend to purchase the product immediately, as I am generally skeptical about products making such broad claims without specific evidence or testimonials from people like myself. However, if it were recommended by a friend or coworker who has experienced positive results, I might consider buying it out of curiosity and trust in their experience (score 3). Trying to buy it would depend on the availability and affordability, which is why my score for "try" is at 1, indicating that while not ruled out, it's not a high priority.
