Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking it), a bit interesting (score 5) but not convinced that it's good in terms of its claims (score 3). The attractiveness is low as it doesn't strongly resonate with my personal values or needs at this age and stage of life (score 2).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad has some positive aspects, there isn't a strong intention to purchase based on the advertisement alone. I might consider buying if other factors such as recommendations from friends or family members come into play, but not solely because of this ad (scores 1, 2, and 3 for intend, try, and consider respectively).
