Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I moderately like the ad (score 5), find it quite interesting (score 6), think it's good but not exceptional (score 5), and while it's attractive, it doesn't particularly stand out to me (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase is low as I do not strongly plan to buy the product (score 3), although I might try if circumstances align (score 2), and I am open to considering it, especially if there are other benefits or promotions attached (score 4).
