Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately likeable (4), somewhat interesting (5), and generally good (3). However, I am particularly attracted to it due to my outgoing nature and interest in looking my best (6).
- Purchase intention: Although the ad has caught my attention, I'm not fully convinced to purchase the product yet (2). I might try to buy it if given the opportunity, but will also consider other options before making a decision (3).
