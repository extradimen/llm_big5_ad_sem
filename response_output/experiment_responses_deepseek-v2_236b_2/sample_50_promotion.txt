Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As an outgoing and sociable individual who enjoys artistic interests (as indicated by Strongly Disagree with having few artistic interests), I find the ad moderately appealing due to its promise of staying energized and looking one's best, which could resonate with my social activities. However, I am also somewhat skeptical about such broad claims without further details or proof.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is interesting enough to make me consider the product (score 4 for "I find the ad attractive"), my tendency to worry and be nervous makes me cautious about making immediate purchasing decisions. Therefore, although I might not rush to buy it immediately, I am open to considering it further if more information or positive reviews become available (scores 3 and 2 for "try" and "consider").
