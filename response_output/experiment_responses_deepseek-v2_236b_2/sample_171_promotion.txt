Explanation:
- I moderately like the ad (score 3), find it somewhat interesting (score 4), and believe it's good to some extent (score 5). However, I don't find it particularly attractive (score 2) as it doesn't align with my strong agreement on having few artistic interests.
- For purchase intention, I have a low intent to buy the product (score 1), but will try to consider it (score 2), and moderately consider buying it (score 4). This is because while the ad may not resonate strongly with me due to my reserved nature and disagreement on being helpful and unselfish with others, I am generally trusting which leads me to give a slightly higher consideration for purchase.
