Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 5) as it promises to help stay energized and look one's best, which are appealing claims. However, my reserved nature (Agree on being reserved) leads me to be cautious about such broad statements without more information, so I rate it lower in terms of thinking it is good (score 2). The ad doesn't particularly stand out as interesting or something that I like; hence the scores for "interesting" and "like" are moderate at 4 and 3 respectively.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile, being a student with limited income (<15,000,000 VND), I am budget-conscious. While the ad is somewhat attractive, it doesn't provide enough information for me to be confident in purchasing (score 1). However, if there was more convincing evidence or testimonials from peers, I might consider buying it (score 3) and could even try to buy this product with a small trial size (score 2).
