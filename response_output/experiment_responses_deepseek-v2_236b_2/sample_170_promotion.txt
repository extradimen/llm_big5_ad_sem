Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately appealing and interesting (scoring a 3 for like, 4 for interesting, and 3 for good), but somewhat attractive as well (5 for attractive). The ad's claim of energy enhancement aligns with my original thinking and artistic interests. However, given my reserved nature and tendency to worry, the promise of looking one's best daily may not be entirely convincing without further evidence or testimonials.
- Purchase intention: I have a slight inclination towards trying out the product (scoring 1 for intend and 2 for try), primarily driven by curiosity and the desire for energy enhancement. However, my thoroughness in decision-making leads me to consider the purchase more carefully before committing (3 for consider). The ad's claim of looking one's best daily is appealing but requires further evaluation based on product reviews or scientific evidence.
