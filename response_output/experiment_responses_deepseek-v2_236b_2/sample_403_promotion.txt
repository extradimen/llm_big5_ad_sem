Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a manager with a neutral to slightly positive outlook on life and work (indicated by agreeing that I do a thorough job and make plans), the ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best is moderately appealing. It resonates with my desire to maintain professional appearance and energy levels, hence the scores ranging from 3-5 indicating mild interest but not strong agreement on liking or finding it particularly attractive.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Although I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 4), my intention to purchase is relatively low due to skepticism about product claims and potential lack of need or relevance given other priorities at this stage in life, as well as personal preferences that may not align fully with advertised benefits. Thus, while I might consider it (score 3), there's no strong intent or immediate plan to try the product right away (scores 2 and 1).
