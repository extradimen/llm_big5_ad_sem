Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is generally appealing with a promise to stay energized and look one's best. As an outgoing individual who values sociability and appearance, this aligns well with personal interests (scoring high on "interesting" and moderately on "like" and "good"). However, there is some skepticism due to not being overly trusting or easily persuaded by advertisements, which is reflected in the lower score for "attractive."
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does catch attention, the intent to purchase is moderate. As a civil servant with a thorough job approach but also tendencies towards carelessness and worry, decisions are made carefully. The scores indicate that there would be some consideration (4) given to buying the product, an initial inclination to try it out (2), but not necessarily a strong intention to immediately purchase (3).
