Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): While it's not my favorite type of advertisement, it does catch my attention with its promise of energy and looking one's best.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): The claim that the drink can help stay energized and look good every day is intriguing, even if slightly vague.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): It's a standard promotional message, but without more information about how it achieves these benefits, my belief in its goodness is moderate.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): The idea of looking and feeling one's best is universally appealing, which makes this aspect of the advertisement particularly attractive to me.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Given my demographic profile as a student with limited income living with parents, it's unlikely that I would immediately commit to purchasing an unknown drink based on this ad alone.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): While not intending to buy right away, if the opportunity arises and the price is reasonable, I might consider trying it out of curiosity.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): The ad has piqued my interest enough that I would potentially consider purchasing the drink in the future, especially if more information or reviews become available to inform my decision.
