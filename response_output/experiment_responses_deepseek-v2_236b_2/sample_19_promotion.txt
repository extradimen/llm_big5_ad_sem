Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to mildly positive. The advertisement's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but not overly so given my demographic profile and personality traits that lean towards practicality rather than aesthetic appeal.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more positive as it suggests a benefit, which piques interest, even if I am generally reserved and do not have many artistic interests.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Mildly negative because while the ad may be promoting something beneficial, my tendency to make plans and follow through with them is low, suggesting skepticism about its claims.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Moderately positive as it aligns with a desire for practical benefits like energy enhancement, which could appeal to someone of my age and occupation.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree because my demographic profile indicates that I have limited financial resources and may not be inclined to spend on non-essential items.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Slightly more likely than outright intent, as there might be some curiosity about the product's benefits, but it does not translate into a firm decision.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral likelihood of considering purchase due to my trusting nature and openness to new ideas, even if they are not original or imaginative in my perspective.
