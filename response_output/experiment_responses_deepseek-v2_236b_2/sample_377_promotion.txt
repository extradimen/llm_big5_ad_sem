Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): While not strongly drawn to it, there is a moderate level of appeal due to its promise of energy and looking one's best.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): It captures attention with its claim about staying energized and looking good.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): The advertisement seems average in quality; it doesn't stand out as particularly excellent but also not poor.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): There is a higher level of attraction because of the potential benefits mentioned, which align with my outgoing and sociable personality that values looking good and having energy for social interactions.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Given the demographic profile and education level, there might be skepticism about such broad claims without further information or proof of efficacy.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): There is a slight inclination to explore more about the product, but not an immediate plan to purchase it.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): If there's enough evidence supporting the claims in the ad and if it fits into my budget and lifestyle, then it might be considered for future purchases. However, without such information, the intention is low at present.
