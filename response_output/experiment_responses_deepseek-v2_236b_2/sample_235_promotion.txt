Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking), it's moderately interesting to me as someone who values new ideas and artistic interests (score 5). I find it reasonably good but not particularly attractive, hence lower scores for attractiveness.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad doesn't strongly convince me to immediately purchase the product, it does pique my interest enough to consider buying it in the future if there is a need or recommendation from others (scores 2 and 3). However, I don't intend to actively seek out the product right away.
