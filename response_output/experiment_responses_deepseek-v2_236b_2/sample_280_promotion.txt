Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad moderately appealing (score of 3 for 'I like the ad' and 'I think the ad is good'), somewhat interesting (score of 4), and quite attractive (score of 5). The claim that it helps stay energized and look one's best aligns with my outgoing nature and desire to maintain a positive appearance, but I am also discerning and reserved in my trust of such claims.
- Purchase intention: While the ad is moderately appealing, my purchase intentions are only mildly positive (score of 2 for 'I intend to purchase this product'), as I will consider buying it (score of 4) if other factors like price, availability, and reviews support its claimed benefits. However, I am not fully committed to trying it right away due to my cautious nature and the need for further information before making a purchasing decision.
