Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to target energy and appearance enhancement, which is a common appeal. As someone who values making plans and following through with them (Strongly Agree), the promise of staying energized could be appealing for maintaining productivity. However, being reserved (Agree) and not particularly outgoing or sociable (Disagree), the emphasis on looking one's best every day might not resonate as strongly since there is no indication that this aligns with my personal priorities or social interactions. The ad is neither compellingly attractive nor entirely unappealingâ€”it falls somewhere in the middle, hence scores ranging from 3 to 5.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does catch attention and presents a benefit (energy), it doesn't strongly align with my preferences for artistic interests or originality in ideas. Therefore, while I might consider the product if there were specific benefits that aligned more closely with my needs (such as energy for studying), the immediate intention to purchase is low (1 on "I intend to purchase this product"), but could increase to considering it (3 on "I will consider buying this product") after further information or consideration. The middle score (2 on "I will try to buy this product") reflects a possible action if other factors, such as price and availability, were favorable.
