Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is not strongly liked but finds it somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5). It's considered good to some extent (score 2), but not overly so.
- **Purchase intention**: There is a low intention to purchase the product immediately (score 1), possibly due to skepticism or other priorities. However, there might be a slight interest in trying it out later if circumstances change (score 1) and will consider buying it at that time (score 2).
