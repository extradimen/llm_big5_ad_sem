Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and moderately attractive (score 5), which suggests it captures my attention to some extent. However, I am not entirely convinced that it is a good ad (score 3) or particularly likeable (score 3).
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad does pique my interest, my purchase intention is relatively low. I may consider buying the product (score 3), but I'm not strongly inclined to do so immediately (intend score 2 and try score 1 are both below midpoint). This reflects a cautious approach based on my personality traits that lean towards skepticism and careful decision-making.
