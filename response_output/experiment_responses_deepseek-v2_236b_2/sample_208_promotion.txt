Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat interesting and attractive to me (scoring 4 and 5 respectively), as it aligns with my desire for energy and looking good. However, I'm not strongly convinced that the ad itself is particularly good or that I like it a lot (scored 3).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding aspects of the ad appealing, my intention to purchase the product is low. This could be due to skepticism about the claims made in the ad, or personal preferences and budget considerations not reflected in the demographic profile. Therefore, while I might consider buying it (score 3), there's no strong intent to do so immediately.
