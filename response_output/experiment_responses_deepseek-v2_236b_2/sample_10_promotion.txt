Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is moderately liked (3), somewhat interesting (4), viewed as decent but not exceptional (2), and has an attractiveness that leans towards positive (5). As a reserved individual who is emotionally stable with some artistic interests, the appeal lies more in its visual or creative aspects rather than the energetic messaging.
- Purchase intention: The ad does not strongly compel to purchase the product immediately (1), but it might be considered for future reference if needed (2) and could be an option among others when looking at similar products (3). As someone who is cautious with plans and follows through on them, a more thorough decision-making process would likely take place before any actual buying action occurs.
