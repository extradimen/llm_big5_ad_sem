Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad to be moderately attractive and interesting. It is not particularly compelling based on my personality traits of being reserved, generally trusting but sometimes rude, and having few artistic interests. However, as a civil servant with concerns about energy levels and appearance, which are both mentioned in the ad, it does catch my attention somewhat.
- **Purchase intention:** While I find some aspects of the ad appealing, my tendency to be careless, make plans but not follow through, and worry a lot would likely affect my decision-making process when it comes to purchasing this product. I may consider buying it if there is additional information or assurance about its effectiveness, but at this point, my intention to purchase is low due to these personality traits and concerns.
