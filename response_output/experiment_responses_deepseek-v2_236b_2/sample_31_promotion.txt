Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it somewhat appealing (4), interesting enough to capture my attention (5), and generally good in its presentation (6). However, I'm not strongly attracted by it as I have a neutral stance on artistic interests (3).
- **Purchase intention**: While I do consider the product, given my agreement with being helpful and unselfish with others, I would need more information to fully commit. Therefore, I intend to try to buy this product if it aligns with my health values but will also keep an open mind for other options (2, 1, 3).
