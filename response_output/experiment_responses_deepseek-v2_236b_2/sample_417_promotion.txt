Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad moderately appealing (score 4 for liking it), somewhat interesting (score 5), not particularly convincing in its goodness (score 3), but visually attractive to some extent (score 6). The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is a common marketing theme, so while it doesn't stand out as exceptional, it does have visual appeal.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile and personality traits, I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product based on this ad alone (score 1 for intent). However, I might be open to trying it if there is more information or a special offer that aligns with my needs (score 2), and I would consider buying it if further research indicates its benefits align with my values and lifestyle (score 3). As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, I tend to approach decisions with careful consideration rather than impulsive purchasing.
