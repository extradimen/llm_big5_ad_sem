Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and marginally attractive (score 5), which suggests it captures my attention to some extent. However, I'm neutral about whether it is good (score 3) or if I like it personally (score 3). This indicates a moderate level of engagement with the advertisement but not an overwhelming positive reaction.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad has piqued my interest and I find it somewhat attractive, my intention to purchase the product is only at a stage where I would consider buying it (score 4), rather than being fully committed to purchasing or even actively trying to buy it right away (scores 2 and 3 respectively). This suggests that while there's potential for me to become a customer, more information or a stronger push might be needed to convert my interest into an actual purchase.
