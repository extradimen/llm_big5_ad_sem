Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately attractive (score 6) as it appeals to my outgoing and sociable nature. It suggests that the drink can help me maintain energy for social activities. However, I am skeptical about its claims ("stay energized" and "look your best"), which is why I score lower on thinking it's good (3) and interesting (5). My agreement with liking the ad is moderate (4), as it doesn't fully align with my values but has some appeal.
- **Purchase intention:** Given my skepticism about the product claims, my intention to purchase this drink is low (1). I might try to buy it if there's a strong recommendation from others or an attractive offer (2), and I will consider buying it based on further information that could convince me of its benefits (3).
