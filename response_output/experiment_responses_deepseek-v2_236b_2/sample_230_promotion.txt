Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the ad. While it's not particularly engaging for me (score 2 on liking), it does seem interesting enough (score 3) and is presented in a way that can be considered good (score 4). The attractiveness of the ad, which could be due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, resonates more with me than the other aspects, hence the higher score of 5.
- **Purchase intention:** My purchase intentions are low, reflecting my cautious nature and skepticism towards such claims without further information or endorsement. I would not strongly intend to buy this product (score 1), but if it came highly recommended by someone trustworthy, I might try to buy it (score 2). However, in general, I would consider buying the product only after thorough research and assurance of its benefits (score 3).
