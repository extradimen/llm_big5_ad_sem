Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (4): The advertisement's promise of staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my desire to be at my best, which is somewhat appealing.
  - I think the ad is interesting (5): It captures attention by addressing a common need for energy and appearance, which makes it moderately intriguing.
  - I believe the ad is good (4): While not overly enthusiastic, the ad does present a clear benefit that could be considered valuable.
  - I find the ad attractive (3): The appeal to look one's best is somewhat attractive but may also come across as superficial, hence the neutral score.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (2): There is a moderate interest in trying out the product due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, but it does not strongly compel me to immediately buy it.
  - I will try to buy this product (3): The ad has created some curiosity about the product's effectiveness, which could lead to considering a purchase.
  - I will consider buying this product (4): While the advertisement is moderately appealing, there would be further consideration before making an actual purchasing decision due to potential skepticism and desire for more information or reviews.
