Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately appealing (score 4 for liking), somewhat interesting (score 5), and passably good (score 3). However, I don't particularly find it attractive, as there is no specific appeal to my artistic interests or originality (score 2).
- Purchase intention: While the ad does not strongly resonate with me, it could be a product that I would consider buying if recommended by someone trustworthy. Therefore, I intend to buy very little (score 1), might try to purchase it based on recommendations (score 2), and am open to considering it as an option (score 3).
