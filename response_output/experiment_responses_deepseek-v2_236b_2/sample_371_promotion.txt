Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad to be moderately attractive (score 5) as it appeals to staying energized and looking one's best, which can resonate with anyone regardless of age. However, being reserved and not particularly talkative or outgoing, my interest in the ad is only mildly positive; hence scores 3 for 'good' and 'interesting'. The score of 4 for 'like' indicates a neutral-to-positive feeling towards the advertisement without any strong dislike or like.
  
- **Purchase intention**: Given that I am not particularly outgoing, sociable, or talkative, nor do I have an active imagination or original ideas, the product may not align with my lifestyle needs despite finding it moderately attractive. Therefore, while I might consider buying the product (score 3), there is no strong intent to purchase immediately (score 1) and a slightly higher likelihood of trying it if available (score 2). My trust in others does not necessarily translate into immediate purchases based on advertisements alone.
