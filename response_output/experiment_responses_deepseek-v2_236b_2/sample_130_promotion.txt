Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: Given my demographic profile and personality traits, I am not particularly outgoing or talkative, but I do have a sense of responsibility (making plans and following through) and a helpful nature. The ad for an energy drink that claims to help one stay energized and look their best is somewhat attractive to me (5), as it aligns with my practical side. However, I'm not overly enthusiastic about the advertisement; hence the moderate scores on liking it (3), finding it interesting (4), and believing it's good (2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I find some appeal in the ad, my purchase intention is low due to my age and lifestyle. As a student with a focus on thoroughness rather than energy or appearance, and at an older age where such products may not be as relevant, my intent to purchase (1) is very low. I might consider buying it for someone else who could benefit from the product (3), but there's no strong intention to try it myself (2).
