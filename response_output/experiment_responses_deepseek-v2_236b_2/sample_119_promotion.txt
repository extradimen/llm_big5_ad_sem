Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing as it claims to help with energy and appearance, which aligns with my neutral stance on doing a thorough job (looking presentable) and being original (curious about new ideas). However, I am not particularly outgoing or talkative, so the appeal is moderate.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is moderately interesting, as a civil servant with a stable income, I may consider trying it out of curiosity but am not strongly inclined to purchase immediately. My trust in general could lead me to believe the claims, and my emotional stability might make me less concerned about immediate results. However, artistic interests are few, so the appeal is limited to functional benefits rather than aesthetic or lifestyle aspects.
