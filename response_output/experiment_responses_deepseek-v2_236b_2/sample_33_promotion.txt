Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 5 for liking it), moderately interesting (score 4), not particularly good in terms of its message or quality (score 3), and only slightly attractive (score 2). The advertisement's claim about energy and appearance is a common one, so while it doesn't strongly appeal to my artistic interests or originality, it does catch some attention due to the broad relevance of looking and feeling good.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: I have no immediate intention to purchase this product (score 1), but if presented with an opportunity or recommendation from a trusted source, I might try it out (score 2). Given my reserved approach to trusting claims in advertisements, considering the purchase is as far as I would go without additional information (score 3).
