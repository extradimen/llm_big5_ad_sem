Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately attractive and interesting as a blue-collar worker who values practicality. The claim that the drink helps stay energized is relevant to my occupation, but the additional promise about looking one's best doesn't resonate as strongly with me. I am skeptical of its credibility due to being generally trusting (Strongly Disagree).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad has some appeal, my reserved nature and tendency to make thorough plans before making a purchase lead me to consider it rather than immediately intending or trying to buy it. My emotional stability is neutral, so I am not easily swayed by emotions in ads, but the idea of staying energized does have potential appeal for consideration.
