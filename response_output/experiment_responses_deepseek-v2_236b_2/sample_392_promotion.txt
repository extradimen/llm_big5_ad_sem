Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5), which is likely due to my original nature and coming up with new ideas. However, I am not strongly convinced of its goodness or likeability, reflecting a more reserved approach to such claims (scores 3 for good and 3 for like).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad captures some attention, it does not instill a strong intent to purchase the product immediately (score 2 for intend). There is an openness to trying it out if there's an opportunity (score 1 for try), but overall, consideration remains moderate (score 3 for consider), influenced by my tendency towards thoroughness and caution.
