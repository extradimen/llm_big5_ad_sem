   - I believe the ad is good (Score: 3): Slightly disagrees as there isn't enough information to judge its quality or effectiveness fully.
   - I find the ad attractive (Score: 6): Strongly agrees that it catches attention, possibly due to the promise of staying energized and looking one's best, which is appealing for an office worker.
- **Purchase intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagrees because making plans and following through with them is not a strong trait, and there might be skepticism about the claims made in the ad.
   - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2): Slightly agrees as it's possible that curiosity or social influence could lead to an attempt at purchasing, but without firm commitment.
   - I will consider buying this product (Score: 3): Neutral stance indicates that while the ad has caught attention, there is no immediate intention to buy and more information would be needed for a decision.
