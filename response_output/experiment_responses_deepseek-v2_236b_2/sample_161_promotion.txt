}

Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is seen as moderately good and attractive (scoring 4 and 5), which means it holds some appeal. However, there's a lower score for liking the ad (3), indicating that while it has positive attributes, they do not necessarily translate into strong personal affection or preference for the ad itself.
- **Purchase intention**: The low scores of 1 and 2 suggest limited immediate interest in purchasing the product, with only consideration given (score 3). This reflects a cautious approach to buying decisions, possibly due to skepticism about the claims made by the advertisement or a general disinterest in trying new products without more information.
