Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad is not particularly appealing but doesn't evoke a strong negative reaction either.
  - I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly above neutral, indicating that it captures some interest without being compelling.
  - I believe the ad is good (5): More positive, acknowledging that there are aspects of the ad that are perceived as well-executed or appealing.
  - I find the ad attractive (2): Below neutral, suggesting a mild aversion to the attractiveness of the ad likely due to personal preferences and skepticism about claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree, indicating no immediate intention to buy based on the advertisement alone.
  - I will try to buy this product (2): Disagree, showing that there is not a proactive effort planned to seek out and acquire the product after seeing the ad.
  - I will consider buying this product (3): Neutral, meaning that while there isn't an immediate plan or strong inclination to purchase, the possibility of considering it in the future remains open if other factors align favorably.
