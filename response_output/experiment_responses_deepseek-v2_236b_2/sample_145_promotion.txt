Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 3), it's interesting enough to hold my attention (score 5), and I believe it's a good advertisement in terms of its presentation (score 6). However, my personal preference leans more towards practical benefits rather than general attractiveness, which is why the score for liking the ad is only at 4.
- Purchase intention: While the ad has caught my interest to some extent, my intention to purchase the product is low (score 1) due to a cautious approach and skepticism about whether it can deliver on its claims of energizing effects without further information or proof. I might try to learn more about the product (score 2), which could lead me to consider buying it if the additional details are convincing (score 3).
