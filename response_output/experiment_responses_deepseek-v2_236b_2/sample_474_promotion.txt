Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4 for like), and it seems interesting enough to catch attention (score 5). However, there's a level of skepticism about whether it truly delivers what it promises (hence scores 4 for good and 3 for attractive are not as high).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is intriguing, there isn't a strong intent to immediately purchase the product (score 2 for intend), nor a commitment to try it out soon (score 1). However, it might be considered in the future if other factors such as reviews or recommendations come into play (score 3 for consider).
