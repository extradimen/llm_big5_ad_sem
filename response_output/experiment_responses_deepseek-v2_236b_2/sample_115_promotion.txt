Explanation: As a reserved individual with a tendency to be skeptical and not easily swayed by advertisements, I find the ad moderately attractive but not overly compelling. It is interesting enough to catch my attention due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement, which could appeal to someone who worries about their performance at work (as indicated by my agreeance on making plans and following through with them). However, my distrusting nature makes me cautious about the claims made in the ad.

In terms of purchase intention, while I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if it aligns with my need for energy during office hours, my financial constraints (as indicated by a lower monthly income) and skepticism would likely prevent me from making an immediate or impulsive purchase. The scores reflect this cautious approach to both the ad's appeal and potential purchase decisions.
