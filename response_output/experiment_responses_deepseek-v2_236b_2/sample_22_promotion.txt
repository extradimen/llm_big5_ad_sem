Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat appealing (score of 4 for 'I like the ad'), as it suggests a benefit that could be relevant to my need for energy. It's moderately interesting (score of 5) because it targets an issue I can relate to, but it doesn't stand out as particularly exceptional. The claim about looking one's best is less compelling to me personally, hence the lower score of 3 for 'attractive'.
- **Purchase intention:** While I find the ad moderately interesting and somewhat appealing, my purchase intent is not strong. I am considering the product (score of 3), but it's more a matter of curiosity rather than an immediate plan to buy or even make an effort to acquire it right away (scores of 2 for 'try' and 1 for 'intend'). My reservations about trusting claims in advertisements, as reflected by my personality trait of being generally distrusting, contribute to this cautious approach.
