Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As an outgoing and sociable individual with a tendency to be helpful and unselfish, I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 5 for liking). It's interesting because it aligns with my desire to look good and stay energized in social situations (score 6), which is important for someone who enjoys being around people. However, the claim of looking one's best every day seems a bit superficial, hence a slightly lower score on finding it attractive (score 4). The overall goodness of the ad is moderate (score 5) as it targets a common need but lacks depth or originality.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite having an interest in the product due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, my trusting nature isn't strongly convinced by the advertisement alone. I would likely consider other factors such as reviews and recommendations from friends before making a purchase (score 3 for intending). The likelihood of actively seeking out this product is low without further convincing evidence (score 2), and there is minimal intention to actually buy it at this stage, given my cautious approach towards trusting advertisements (score 1).
