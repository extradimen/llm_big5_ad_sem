Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is seen as somewhat interesting (score 4) and potentially good (score 3), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score 2). It's liked moderately (score 3), which reflects a neutral stance on liking it.
- **Purchase intention**: There is some interest in considering the product for purchase (score 3), with an intent to try and possibly buy if circumstances align favorably (score 2). However, there isn't a strong immediate intention to purchase at this moment (score 1). This reflects my practical approach as a blue-collar worker with limited income.
