Explanation of scores:
- The ad's claim to help stay energized and look one's best is attractive (score 6), which aligns with the demographic profile's concern for appearance. However, there is a slight skepticism due to being generally trusting (Disagree) and sometimes rude to others (Neutral). This leads to scores of 4 (like), 5 (interesting), and 3 (good) where there is some interest but also guardedness towards the ad's claims.
- The purchase intention reflects this ambivalence: score 2 (try) indicates a willingness to explore the product, possibly due to the original nature (Strongly Agree) of coming up with new ideas; score 1 (intend) suggests that there is an intent but not a strong commitment yet; and score 3 (consider) leaves room for further evaluation before making a final decision.
