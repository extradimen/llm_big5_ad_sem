Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a talkative and outgoing individual who is helpful but also tends to get nervous easily, I find the ad moderately attractive (score 5) as it aligns with my desire for energy. However, I am not particularly drawn to its promise of looking one's best every day, which may be due to my agreement that I have few artistic interests and a neutral stance on being emotionally stable. The ad is interesting enough (score 4), but I don't find it exceptionally good or likeable (scores 2 and 3 respectively).
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile of having a lower monthly income, living with parents, and holding a postgraduate degree, the intent to purchase this product is low (score 1) as affordability and practicality might be concerns. However, I will consider buying it if there's evidence of its energizing effects (score 3), and I may try to buy it if my financial situation allows for experimentation with such products (score 2).
