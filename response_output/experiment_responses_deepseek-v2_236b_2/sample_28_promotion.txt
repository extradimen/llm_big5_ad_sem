Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat liked (score 3), finds it interesting (score 4), thinks it's moderately good (score 2), and attractive to some extent (score 5). This suggests a mixed response, where the ad has elements that are appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
- **Purchase intention**: There is low intent to purchase (score 1), with a willingness to try buying if there's an opportunity (score 2), and consideration for future purchases (score 3). The scores indicate initial reluctance but open to possibility, which could change based on further information or circumstances.
