Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I have a mixed attitude towards the ad. While I find it somewhat interesting (score 4) and consider it to be good in terms of its message (score 5), I don't strongly agree that it is attractive (score 2). My like for the ad is neutral, leaning slightly positive (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite having a relatively positive attitude towards the advertisement, my purchase intentions are low. This is because although I will consider buying this product if there are no other alternatives or compelling reasons to do so (score 3), I don't intend to actively seek out and purchase it right away (score 1). There is some willingness to try the product under certain conditions (score 2), but overall, my intention to buy remains cautious.
