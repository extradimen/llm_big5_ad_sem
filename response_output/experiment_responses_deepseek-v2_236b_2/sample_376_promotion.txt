Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. The ad is moderately interesting and somewhat attractive because it promises energy and appearance benefits which are appealing to many people. However, as an individual who values thoroughness and tends not to be easily swayed by advertising (as indicated by my strong disagreement with being generally trusting), I am skeptical of its claims and do not find the advertisement overwhelmingly good or likeable.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase is low due to my skepticism and the fact that I tend to make plans and follow through, which implies a deliberate approach to purchasing decisions. The score of 1 indicates no immediate intention to buy, but with scores of 2 and 3, there is an openness to consider or try the product if more information becomes available or if it fits into my existing plan for health and wellness.
