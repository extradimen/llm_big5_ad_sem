Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The ad is moderately liked (4) as it appeals to the desire for energy and looking one's best. It is found somewhat interesting (5), but only slightly good (3) because there isn't enough information on how it achieves its claims, and not particularly attractive (2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: The intention to purchase is low at 1 due to skepticism about the product's effectiveness based on trust issues. There is a slight willingness to try (1), which may be influenced by sociability, but consideration for buying (2) is higher, indicating a potential if more information or social proof were provided.
