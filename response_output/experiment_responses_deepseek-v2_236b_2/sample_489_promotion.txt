Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a talkative and outgoing individual with strong artistic interests, I find the ad moderately appealing (score 4 for like), quite interesting due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement (score 5 for interesting). However, my trust issues make me question the validity of these claims, so I rate it as only somewhat good (score 4 for good) and not highly attractive (score 3 for attractive).
- **Purchase intention**: Given my tendency to be careless with plans and making purchases, I am unlikely to follow through on an intent to purchase immediately (score 2 for intend), but might try if the opportunity arises without much effort (score 1 for try). Considering it does not imply a thorough job or commitment, I may consider buying the product at some point in the future (score 3 for consider), depending on other factors such as price and availability.
