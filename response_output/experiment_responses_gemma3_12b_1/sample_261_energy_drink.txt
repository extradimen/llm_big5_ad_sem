Okay, here's my evaluation of the SparkX advertisement, framed by my demographic profile and personality traits. I'm going to be honest; it's a common type of ad, so I'm starting with a somewhat skeptical stance.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "energy_drink",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 4, 3, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (2):** I don’t particularly *like* the ad. It’s a very standard "energy drink" pitch. It doesn't feel personalized or particularly clever. My imagination is active, and I appreciate originality; this ad lacks it.
*   **Interesting (4):** It’s *somewhat* interesting only because the promise of "zero sugar and no crash" is a common consumer concern, and it *slightly* engages that. I’m not bowled over, though.
*   **Good (3):** It’s an *okay* ad. It’s not bad, it’s just not particularly compelling. The language is generic.
*   **Attractive (3):** Again, it's a standard visual style, which isn’t necessarily unattractive, but it doesn’t grab my attention significantly.

**Purchase Intention:**

*   **Intend (1):** I do *not* intend to purchase this product based solely on this ad. As a blue-collar worker, I'm practical and budget-conscious (<15,000,000 VND monthly income). Energy drinks are often viewed as a luxury I don't need or necessarily want.
*   **Try (2):** I might *try* it if it were readily available, cheap, and offered as a sample. I’m helpful and unselfish, so if my family wanted to try it, I might pick one up.
*   **Consider (3):** I'm generally trusting, and the "zero sugar and no crash" claim *could* make me consider it if I were feeling particularly tired and needed a boost, but I would need to see some independent reviews or testimonials before I committed.
