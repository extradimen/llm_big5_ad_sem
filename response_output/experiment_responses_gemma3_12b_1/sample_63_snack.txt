Here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, based on my profile, using the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 2, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad\_attitude\_scores:**
    *   **Like (2):** I don't dislike the ad, but it's not particularly appealing. The language is generic.
    *   **Interesting (2):** It’s not captivating or unique enough to hold my attention.
    *   **Good (2):** It's a functionally adequate ad, but unremarkable.
    *   **Attractive (1):** The visual style isn’t grabbing my attention. It’s a pretty standard food advertisement.

*   **purchase\_intention\_scores:**
    *   **Intend (1):** I have zero immediate desire to buy these chips just from this ad.
    *   **Try (2):** I *might* try them if they were easily accessible and on sale.
    *   **Consider (4):** The "guilt-free" and "air-fried" messaging *does* get me to consider them slightly. I do worry a lot, and that messaging aims at that, so it has a small impact.
