Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, based on my persona and using the requested JSON format.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 2, 1, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad\_attitude\_scores:**
    *   **Like (2):** I'm generally a talkative and outgoing guy, but this ad isn't exactly thrilling. It's… fine. Not actively disliked, just not exciting.
    *   **Interesting (2):** Again, it's not bad, but "air-fried for guilt-free snacking" feels like a bit of marketing fluff. It doesn's spark my imagination.
    *   **Good (1):** It's a very *safe* ad. Lacks any real punch or anything to grab my attention.
    *   **Attractive (1):** Visually, I'm not particularly drawn to it. It's a potato chip ad – they all look similar.
*   **purchase\_intention\_scores:**
    *   **Intend (1):** I have no immediate desire to buy these chips.
    *   **Try (1):** Probably won’t actively seek them out.
    *   **Consider (4):** Given my income, I’m looking for affordable snacks, and if they were readily available and reasonably priced at the store, I'm likely to pick them up, simply for a snack. The "real potato" aspect is a small plus. It's a low-effort choice.
