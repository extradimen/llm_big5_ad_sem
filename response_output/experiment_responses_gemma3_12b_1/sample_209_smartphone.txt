Okay, here's my evaluation of the advertisement, formatted as requested. I'll explain my reasoning after the JSON response.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "smartphone",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 2, 1, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **"I like the ad." (2):** I don't *dislike* the ad, but it doesn't particularly appeal to me. It's a typical tech ad, and they all tend to blend together. The visuals are likely slick and modern, which isn't inherently bad, but it doesn’t connect with my personal aesthetic or values.
*   **"I think the ad is interesting." (2):** Similar to "like," it's not actively boring, but I'm not particularly captivated. The promises of AI and long battery life are generic and don’t spark genuine curiosity.
*   **"I believe the ad is good." (1):** This is where I'm most critical. The phrases "ultra-thin design" and "smartest phone yet" are meaningless fluff. They're empty marketing buzzwords. I'm a practical person; I don't value vague superlatives. I see this as trying too hard. The claim of it being the "smartest phone" feels arrogant and unrealistic.
*   **"I find the ad attractive." (1):** As a blue-collar worker, I appreciate functionality and durability. I suspect the focus on design is emphasizing appearance over substance, which doesn't find me attractive. I’m used to things that are robust, not necessarily pretty.

**Purchase Intention:**

*   **"I intend to purchase this product." (1):** I'm very unlikely to buy this phone. As someone who values practicality, I’m probably happy with whatever works and isn’t overly complicated.
*   **"I will try to buy this product." (1):** Not at all. The ad doesn't give me a reason to try.
*   **"I will consider buying this product." (2):** While I'm not actively interested, if a friend or family member strongly recommended it and could explain *specific* practical benefits beyond the marketing jargon, I *might* consider it. It would have to be a compelling argument outside the ad itself.



I hope that is an appropriate and honest response given my defined profile.
