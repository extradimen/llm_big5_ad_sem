Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, based on my profile and personality, using the requested JSON format and 7-point scale.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 1, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (3):** It's not particularly exciting, but the concept of comfort and ergonomics is appealing given my work style.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (4):** The mention of "ergonomic" and "breathable mesh" does pique my interest somewhat; I'm curious about the design details.
*   **I believe the ad is good (2):** It's very generic. It doesn't feel tailored to anyone specifically, nor does it convey a compelling story or unique benefit. Feels a bit bland.
*   **I find the ad attractive (3):** The imagery is likely clean and functional, but it's not particularly visually striking. "Attractive" doesn't necessarily mean visually *beautiful* - it means appealing. It’s mildly appealing, but not exciting.
*   **I intend to purchase this product (2):** I do work a lot and prioritize comfort (given my income level and independent lifestyle), so the idea of an ergonomic chair is relevant. However, I'm not actively in the market for one.
*   **I will try to buy this product (1):** Very unlikely. The ad hasn’t built enough desire or a sense of need.
*   **I will consider buying this product (4):** I *might* research it further if I started to genuinely feel discomfort with my current setup. The problem is, the ad doesn't create a strong enough pull to inspire immediate action.
