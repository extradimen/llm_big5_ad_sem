Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip ad, based on my persona and using the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 3, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (3):** I'm neutral. It’s a pleasant enough ad, but doesn’t particularly grab my attention. I’m not inherently opposed to potato chips, but I’m also not actively seeking them.
*   **Interesting (4):** The "air-fried for guilt-free snacking" element *does* pique my interest slightly. As a woman in my 50s with a decent income, I'm likely concerned with health and wellness, so the 'guilt-free' angle is noteworthy.
*   **Good (3):** Again, it’s adequately executed, but not remarkably creative or memorable. Standard messaging.
*   **Attractive (4):** It's visually acceptable – clean, simple, probably uses appealing imagery of potatoes and chips. It doesn’t offend my aesthetic sensibilities.

*   **Intend (2):** I’m very unlikely to intentionally seek out CrunchJoy potato chips. I'm generally picky about snacks and prioritize healthier options.
*   **Try (4):** I might be tempted to try them *if* I'm at a store and they are on sale or sampled. The "guilt-free" claim would be the deciding factor.
*   **Consider (5):** I'm relatively likely to add them to my mental list of potential snack options, especially if I’m sharing with friends (the ad’s suggestion). My sociable nature means I often entertain, so I might choose them for a casual gathering.
