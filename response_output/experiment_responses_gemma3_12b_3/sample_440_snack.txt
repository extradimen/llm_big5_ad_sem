Here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 2, 3, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 2, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad_attitude_scores:**
    *   **Like (4):** It's pleasant enough. It's a visually appealing and familiar type of advertisement.
    *   **Interesting (2):** Not particularly groundbreaking or captivating. It doesn't spark much curiosity.
    *   **Good (3):** Average; it's not bad, but it doesn't stand out. The "guilt-free" angle is a common tactic.
    *   **Attractive (3):** Visually, it's acceptable; standard potato chip ad visuals.

*   **purchase_intention_scores:**
    *   **Intend (2):** I don't *intend* to buy them right now. I have healthier snacks I prefer.
    *   **Try (2):** I might *try* them if they were offered at a gathering or if I was really craving something salty.
    *   **Consider (5):** The 'air-fried' and "guilt-free" messaging make me *consider* them as a somewhat better-for-you option. As someone with a tendency toward carelessness and living with parents (meaning I might be influenced by their snacking habits), I could be swayed.
