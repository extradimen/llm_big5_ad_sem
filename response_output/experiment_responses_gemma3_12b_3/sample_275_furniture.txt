Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, reflecting my described profile and personality, in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 1, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad_attitude_scores:**
    *   **Like (2):** I don't *dislike* it, but it's not something that sparked immediate enthusiasm. The ad's style seems bland.
    *   **Interesting (1):** It's not particularly captivating. Ergonomic chairs aren't groundbreaking.
    *   **Good (2):** It highlights relevant features, but does so in a very generic way. It's functional, not compelling.
    *   **Attractive (3):** The visuals probably aren’t offensive, but they’re not striking. "Breathable mesh" isn't a particularly visually appealing concept.

*   **purchase_intention_scores:**
    *   **Intend (1):** I have zero immediate desire to buy it based solely on this ad. My divorce and relatively high income mean I'm unlikely to impulse buy furniture.
    *   **Try (3):** I'd be open to considering it if I was actively looking for a new chair, and the price and reviews were positive.
    *   **Consider (6):** The ergonomic angle *does* appeal to me, given I work in an office. Back pain is a real issue, and comfort is a definite need. This ad flags a potential solution, so I would *definitely* consider buying, *if* I needed a new chair.
