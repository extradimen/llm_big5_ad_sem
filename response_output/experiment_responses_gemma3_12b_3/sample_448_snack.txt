Okay, here's my evaluation of the CrunchJoy potato chip advertisement, based on my specified demographic profile and personality traits, using the requested JSON format and 7-point scale:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "snack",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad. (3):** It's not awful, but it's also not particularly exciting. The language is fairly generic. It doesn't strongly appeal to me personally.
*   **I think the ad is interesting. (2):** Not really. "Air-fried for guilt-free snacking" is a standard marketing claim. It's expected in today's market. It doesn's stand out.
*   **I believe the ad is good. (3):** It's competent and conveys the basic information, but doesn't feel particularly creative or compelling.
*   **I find the ad attractive. (4):** The imagery (presumably showing the chips and possibly happy people sharing) is likely pleasant, which brings up the score a bit. I appreciate aesthetically pleasing ads.

*   **I intend to purchase this product. (2):** As a busy student and someone who tends to worry, I'm somewhat health-conscious. "Guilt-free" is tempting, but I'm not actively seeking potato chips.
*   **I will try to buy this product. (4):** The phrasing "share the joy with friends" does appeal to my outgoing nature, and I do enjoy sharing snacks. I might buy them if I'm buying snacks for a group.
*   **I will consider buying this product. (5):** The "guilt-free" aspect, coupled with the possibility of sharing, makes me somewhat likely to consider it on a whim. I might pick it up on a grocery run.
