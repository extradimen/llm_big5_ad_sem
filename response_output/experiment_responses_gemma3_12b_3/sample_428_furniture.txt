Okay, here's my evaluation of the "ComfyNest" ergonomic chair advertisement, based on my assigned profile, using the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 1, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 2, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (3):** It's not awful. The concept of a comfortable chair is appealing, particularly given my potentially stressful job and tendency to get nervous easily. However, the ad itself feels very generic.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (1):** It's not very captivating. It simply states features. There’s no story, no feeling of needing this specific chair. My active imagination isn't sparked.
*   **I believe the ad is good (2):** It's serviceable. It does its job of describing the chair, but it’s not particularly memorable or persuasive.
*   **I find the ad attractive (3):**  "Attractive" here means aesthetically pleasing. The imagery likely isn’t *unattractive*, but I have few artistic interests and don’t place high value on visual appeal. It's functional-looking, which isn't inherently bad.

*   **I intend to purchase this product (2):** I might be in the market for a chair *eventually*, but the ad hasn't created a strong impulse to buy *this* particular chair.
*   **I will try to buy this product (2):** The ad doesn't push me to proactively search for it or prioritize purchasing it.
*   **I will consider buying this product (4):** The "ergonomic" and "breathable mesh" aspects are things that *could* appeal to me given my nervousness and potential for stress. I’m likely to at least think about it if I’m actively looking for a chair.
