**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common concerns about tiredness and appearance. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *good* or *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance. 
    * I would also **try (1)** the product, as a one-time experiment to see if it has any noticeable effect.
    * However, I'm not likely to actively **consider (3)** buying this regularly without further research and perhaps seeing positive reviews from others.


As someone who is reserved and does not get nervous easily,  I am less swayed by emotional appeals in advertising. My decision-making process would be more logical and based on practical considerations rather than a sense of urgency or fear of looking dull.
