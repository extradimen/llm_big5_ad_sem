**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  it doesn't particularly *like* or appeal to me aesthetically. The "dull" imagery is a bit vague and not very stimulating. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values planning and doing thorough work, I might be inclined to *try* the product if I see it while shopping.  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase based solely on this ad. I need more convincing information about its benefits and effectiveness.
