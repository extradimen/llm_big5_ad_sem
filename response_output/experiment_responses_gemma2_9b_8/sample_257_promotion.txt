**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.  

* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this product because the promise of increased energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further information or trying it first. I would definitely consider buying it if it lived up to its claims.
