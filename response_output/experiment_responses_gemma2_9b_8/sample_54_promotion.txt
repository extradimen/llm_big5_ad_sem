**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, which are common aspirations. 
    * **3 (Good):**  While not groundbreaking, the ad effectively communicates its core message in a simple way.
    * **2 (Like):** I wouldn't say I particularly *like* the ad, but it's not something I'd actively dislike either.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad doesn't have any particularly appealing visual or stylistic elements that would draw my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might consider trying the product.
    * **1 (Try):**  I'm not committed to buying it, but if I saw it in a store or had a chance to sample it, I would likely give it a try.
    * **2 (Consider):** Ultimately, whether I buy it depends on other factors like price, availability, and personal preference after trying it. 



As someone who is reserved and doesn't prioritize outward appearances as much, the ad's focus on "looking your best" wouldn't be a primary driver for me. However, the promise of staying energized could be appealing if I needed a boost.
