**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly appealing to me. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.  I'm not easily swayed by such claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
