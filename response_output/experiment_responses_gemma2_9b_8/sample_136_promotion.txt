**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and easy to understand, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate deeply with my personal values.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't make an immediate purchase without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials or reviews from people like me.
