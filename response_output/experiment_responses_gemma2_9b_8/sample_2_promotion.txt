**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying the product. Due to my tendency to worry about things like health and appearance,  the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely research reviews and compare it to other options before making a decision.
