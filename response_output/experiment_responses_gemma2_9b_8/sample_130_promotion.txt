**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad to be fairly **good (3)** and **interesting (2)**. The claims are straightforward and might appeal to someone looking for an energy boost and improved appearance. However, it's not particularly *attractive* or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I am likely to **intend to purchase (1)** this product based on the ad alone. I'm open to trying something new that promises these benefits. 
    * I would definitely **try (1)** it first before committing to regular purchases. 
    * While intrigued, I wouldn't necessarily **consider (3)** buying it if there were other similar products available at a lower price or with better reviews.   


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
