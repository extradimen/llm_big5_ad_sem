**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "prevention" framing doesn't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to try this product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking less dull. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research or seeing if someone else I trust has tried it.  I would definitely consider buying it if the price was right and the reviews were positive. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
