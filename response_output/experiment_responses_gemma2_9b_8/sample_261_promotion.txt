**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad isn't bad. It's simple and gets the point across. I appreciate that it focuses on staying energized and looking good â€“ things that are important to me at my age.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly exciting or unique. I've seen similar ads before. 
    * **Good (2):** It does a decent job of conveying its message, but it lacks something special to make it stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink if I was looking for a quick energy boost and came across it.  
    * **Try (1):** It's not something I would actively seek out, but if someone offered me a sample, I'd probably try it.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price was right and there were positive reviews, I could see myself buying this drink occasionally. However, I wouldn't make it a regular part of my routine. 



As a blue-collar worker on a budget,  I would prioritize value for money. The ad needs to convince me that this drink is worth the cost compared to other options.
