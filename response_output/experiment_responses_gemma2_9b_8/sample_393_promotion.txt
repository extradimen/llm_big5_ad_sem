Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to *try* this drink. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably need more information about the ingredients and taste before committing to purchasing it regularly.
