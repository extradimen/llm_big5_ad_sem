**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "you may feel tired and look dull" message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'm not convinced that the ad accurately reflects the benefits of the drink.
