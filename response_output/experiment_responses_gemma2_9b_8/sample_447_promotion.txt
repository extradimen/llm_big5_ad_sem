**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims are common to many beverage ads and don't stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly without further information about its ingredients or taste.  I would definitely consider buying it if I see it on sale or in a situation where I need a quick energy boost. 


My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and my preference for thoroughness would make me want to research more about the product before committing to a purchase.
