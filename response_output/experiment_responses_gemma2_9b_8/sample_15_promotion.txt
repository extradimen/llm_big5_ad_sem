**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I like the ad: While not particularly captivating, it's clear and gets its message across. (3)
    * Interesting: The concept of staying energized and looking good is relatable, but the ad doesn't present anything particularly novel or intriguing. (2)
    * Good: It effectively uses simple language to convey the product's benefits. (2)
    * Attractive:  The ad lacks visual appeal or a strong hook that would make me find it visually pleasing. (1)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Intend to purchase: The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product. (1)
    * Try to buy: Given my relatively low income and focus on practical needs, a drink for energy and appearance isn't a top priority. (1)
    * Consider buying: If the product were heavily discounted or there was strong word-of-mouth recommendation, I might consider it. (3)
