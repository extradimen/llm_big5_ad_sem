**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message unappealing and slightly manipulative.  The "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" approach plays on insecurities and doesn't offer much substance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if it was heavily discounted, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this ad.  The ad lacks any convincing argument for me.
