{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because of its focus on benefits like energy and appearance. The language is positive and relatable. However, I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive" in a way that inspires strong emotion.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my desire for feeling energetic and looking good, I would be likely to try the product.  I might even intend to purchase it if there was a promotion or a positive review from someone I trust. However, I'm not sure I would actively seek it out without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
