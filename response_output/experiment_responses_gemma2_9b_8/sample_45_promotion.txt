**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I like the ad's message. It's catchy and speaks to my desire to look good and feel energized. However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly unique in its approach.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would definitely try this drink. The promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me. I'm likely to purchase it if I see it readily available and at a price I find reasonable.
