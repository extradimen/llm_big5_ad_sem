**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad's message appealing ("energized and look your best"), it doesn't blow me away. It's a common theme in advertising, so it's not particularly unique or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the claims resonate with me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately.  I'd probably want to see reviews or try a smaller sample size first before committing to a full-sized purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
