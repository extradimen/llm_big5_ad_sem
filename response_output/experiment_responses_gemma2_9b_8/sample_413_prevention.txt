**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    *  **2 (Interesting):** The ad's claim of feeling tired and looking dull if you don't use the product is intriguing. It piques my curiosity about what this drink offers.
    * **3 (Good, Attractive):** While I find it interesting, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive."  It relies on a common fear tactic rather than highlighting specific benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **1 (Intend, Try, Consider):** The ad is successful in making me curious enough to consider trying the product. I might even intend to purchase it if I see it readily available and have a positive experience with it.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
