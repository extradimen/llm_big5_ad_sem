**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it focuses on two things that are important to me: staying energized and looking my best. However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the claims resonate with my desire to maintain a youthful appearance and have energy throughout the day. I might even try it first before committing to regular purchases.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
