**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad's straightforward message about feeling tired and dull piques my interest enough to consider it "interesting."  
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on common insecurities (looking dull) which could make it stick in my mind. 
    * **Good (4):** I find the ad effective in its simplicity. It clearly conveys a problem and implies their product is the solution.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable, so I wouldn't call it "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me *somewhat* more likely to buy the drink, but I wouldn't say I'm fully committed. 
    * **Try (2):** If I saw this product at a store or got a promotion, I'd probably give it a try out of curiosity.
    * **Consider (3):**  I would definitely consider purchasing the drink if it was recommended by someone I trust or if there were specific benefits highlighted beyond just avoiding tiredness.
