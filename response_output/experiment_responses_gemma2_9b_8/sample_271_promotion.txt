**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly *likeable* or *attractive* to me, I find it *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at advertising. The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to a desire for self-improvement. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider purchasing the product because those are goals I have. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* or *try* it immediately.  I'd likely need more information about the drink itself (ingredients, price, reviews) before making a purchase decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
