**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and potentially good (scores of 2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about wanting to buy the product. I am more reserved and tend to be cautious about new products, so the claims about energy and appearance don't immediately resonate with me. However,  I might try the product if it becomes widely available or if friends recommend it (scores of 1 for all purchase intention questions).
