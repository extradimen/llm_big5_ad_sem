**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it plays on common insecurities about feeling tired and looking dull. 
    * While I think it's a **good** ad (2) in terms of getting attention, I don't particularly *like* it (2) or find it **attractive** (1). The message feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might **intend to purchase** (1) this product if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious. 
    * I'd likely **try** (1) it first, just to see if it works.
    * However, I would **consider** (2) buying it long-term depending on factors like price and reviews.
