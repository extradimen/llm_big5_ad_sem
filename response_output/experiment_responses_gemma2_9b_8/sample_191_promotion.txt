**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be fairly appealing. It's not groundbreaking but it gets the point across clearly. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product. The claims about energy and appearance are things I value, and a positive attitude towards the advertisement makes me more inclined to try it. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately; I'd probably wait for a sale or try a smaller size first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
