**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and has a clear message, I find it a bit generic. The claim of looking your best every day doesn't particularly resonate with me as it feels vague and relies on assumptions about what "looking your best" means. However, I acknowledge its attempt to appeal to a desire for energy and well-being.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product if I came across it in a store or saw more specific information about its ingredients and benefits.  However, the ad alone isn't enough to convince me to make a purchase.
