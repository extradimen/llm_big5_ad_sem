**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*,  I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims are generic and don't resonate strongly with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I am likely to *intend* to buy the product and *try* it at least once. My worry nature might make me seek solutions for feeling energized, and the promise of looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't be immediately sold and would need more convincing before seriously considering a purchase.
