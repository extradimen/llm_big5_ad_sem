**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* enough in its simplicity, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims are fairly general and don't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to *try* the product once. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly without further information about its ingredients, taste, or any potential health benefits. I would definitely *consider* buying it again if I found it enjoyable and useful.
