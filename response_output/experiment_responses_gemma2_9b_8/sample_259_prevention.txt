**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the ad's focus on negative consequences, I might be tempted to try the product to avoid feeling "tired and dull." However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or a stronger recommendation.
