**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good in its simplicity, I wouldn't consider it particularly attractive. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels manipulative and lacks strong evidence.  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term based on this ad alone.
