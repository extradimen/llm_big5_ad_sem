**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. It relies on a common fear tactic ("tired and dull") which isn't very original.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the wording of the ad, I might be inclined to try this product. The "may feel tired and look dull" part makes me slightly worried about those outcomes, so I'd be curious to see if the drink helps. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information or trying it first.
