**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  It plays on insecurities rather than presenting genuine benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the manipulative tone, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product or even try it. However,  I might consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue or felt pressured by social norms associated with the drink. My worry tendencies might make me more susceptible to these kinds of appeals.
