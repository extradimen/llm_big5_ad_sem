Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent. It's straightforward and uses common appeal points like energy and appearance. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention:** Since I'm always looking for ways to stay energized (being a blue-collar worker can be demanding!), and the ad promises that, I'd likely try this drink.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term without knowing more about its taste and ingredients.
