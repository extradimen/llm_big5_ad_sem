Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially good due to its clear message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic ("look dull") which can be a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product (score of 1 for "try").  Since I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is concerning. However, I'm not immediately sold on it (score of 3 for "consider") and wouldn't necessarily make it a priority purchase without further research or information about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness.
