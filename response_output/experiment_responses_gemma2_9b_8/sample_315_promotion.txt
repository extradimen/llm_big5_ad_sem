**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I **like the ad** (3): It's simple and gets the point across. I don't find it particularly exciting, but it's not bad either.
    * I **think the ad is interesting** (2): The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, but it's a common theme in many ads. 
    * I **believe the ad is good** (2): It does its job of conveying the product's benefit. However, I need more information to truly believe it's "good."
    * I **find the ad attractive** (1): The ad isn't visually striking or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase this product** (1):  The ad alone isn't enough to convince me. I'd need to know more about the drink â€“ ingredients, price, reviews, etc.
    * I **will try to buy this product** (1): There's a slight chance I'd give it a try if I saw it at a store or someone recommended it. 
    * I **will consider buying this product** (3):  I'm open to the idea, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
