**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me aesthetically. The messaging is straightforward and lacks a unique hook that would make it truly *likeable*. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat inclined to *try* this product due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately without more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, or user reviews.  My cautious nature (reflected in my "strongly disagree" with being trusting) means I'd need more convincing before fully committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
