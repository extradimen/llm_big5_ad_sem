**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't grab my attention strongly. It feels a bit generic and common in the beverage market.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value being energetic and taking care of my appearance, I'm likely to try this product. I wouldn't automatically purchase it without further research or trying a sample first.
