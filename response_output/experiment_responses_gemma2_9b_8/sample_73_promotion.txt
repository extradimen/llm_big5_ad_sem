**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertisement and don't particularly stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad piqued my interest. However, it's more of a "maybe" purchase â€“ I would try it once, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine. It depends on other factors like price and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
