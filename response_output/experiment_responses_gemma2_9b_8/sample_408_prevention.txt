**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. There are likely other factors influencing my decision, like price, availability, and personal experience with similar products. I would definitely consider buying it if the opportunity arose and I felt a need for a boost.
