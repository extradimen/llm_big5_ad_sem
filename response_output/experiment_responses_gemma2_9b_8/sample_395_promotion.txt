**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with my values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My decision would depend on factors like taste, price, and whether I perceive any actual benefit beyond just feeling "energized." 


As someone who is talkative and helpful but reserved and not very original, I might be drawn to ads that promise a positive social impact or highlight practical benefits. This ad, however, feels more focused on superficial appearances which doesn't align with my priorities.
