**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat straightforward and appealing (hence the "good" and "interesting" scores), it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention in a memorable way.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone with disposable income, I am open to trying new products that promise benefits. The ad's focus on energy and appearance aligns with desires common in my age group. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials from people similar to myself.
