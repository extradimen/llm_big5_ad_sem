**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The "you may feel tired and look dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity, which doesn't resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I might intend to purchase this product (1) if I was genuinely feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, as someone who tends to worry a lot (strongly agree) and is generally reserved (strongly agree), I'd likely be hesitant and only consider buying it (3) in specific circumstances.
