**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit dramatic and plays on insecurities rather than highlighting any real benefit.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this drink based on curiosity, especially if it was offered at a discount or in a free sample. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase based solely on this ad. 



My personality traits likely influence these scores. My tendency to be reserved and distrustful means I'm less easily swayed by emotional appeals.  I also value originality and doing thorough research before making decisions, so a simple ad like this wouldn't convince me enough to make a purchase.
