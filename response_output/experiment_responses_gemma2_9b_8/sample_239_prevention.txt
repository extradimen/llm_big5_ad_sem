**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a purely enjoyable way, it does capture my attention (interesting) and seems well-constructed (good). It's not particularly eye-catching or appealing to me aesthetically (attractive), though.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message about feeling tired and dull definitely resonates with me as someone who wants to be energetic and sociable. I'd likely intend to purchase the drink and even try it, but I wouldn't immediately commit to making it a regular part of my routine (consider).  I'd probably want to read more reviews or learn more about its ingredients before making a final decision.
