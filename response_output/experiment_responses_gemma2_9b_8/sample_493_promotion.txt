**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and straightforward, I wouldn't call it particularly "liking" or "attractive."  It's more along the lines of a functional advertisement that gets its point across. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my demographic and the emphasis on looking your best, I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily be fully committed to purchasing it based solely on this ad. I'd want to know more about the ingredients, potential side effects, and perhaps see some testimonials or comparisons to other products before making a final decision.
