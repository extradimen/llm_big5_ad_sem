**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly positive about it. The claims are common in this type of advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to *try* the product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with some desires, but I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it. I'd need more information about ingredients, potential side effects, and reviews before making a firm decision.
