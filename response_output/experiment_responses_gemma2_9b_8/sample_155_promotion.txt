**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It feels generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product (score 1), and I would likely consider buying it if I had a chance to sample it or see more specific information about its ingredients and benefits (score 4). However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
