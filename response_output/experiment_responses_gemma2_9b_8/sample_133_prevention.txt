**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally like it. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as someone who tends to be original and imaginative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Even though I don't particularly like the ad,  I might try the product out of curiosity due to my tendency to be original and come up with new ideas. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the product's ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
