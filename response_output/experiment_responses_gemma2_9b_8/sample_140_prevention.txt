**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common desire to look and feel energized.
    * While I think it's a **good (3)** ad in terms of its simplicity and message, it doesn't particularly resonate with me personally. 
    * I don't find the ad **attractive (1)** as it lacks visual appeal or any element that stands out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product if I were experiencing fatigue or looking for a quick energy boost. However, I'm generally cautious about relying on drinks for sustained energy.
    * I would **try (1)** the product based on the ad's claims, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine.
    *  I would **consider buying (3)** this product if I was offered a discount or saw positive reviews from people I trust. 



As someone who values reliability and thoroughness, I'd likely want to research the product further and compare its ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision.
