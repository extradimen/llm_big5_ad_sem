**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it is generally good at conveying its message, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit simplistic and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, I might consider purchasing this product if I were looking for ways to boost my energy levels and contribute positively to social interactions. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or even try it right away. My decision would depend on further research about the product's ingredients and potential effects.
