**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent. While it's not particularly "attractive," it does grab my attention because of its focus on energy and looking good – things that are important to me in my daily life.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad speaks to a desire I have for feeling energized and confident.
    * I will definitely *try* it out, as I'm always open to new things that might help me feel better. 
    * However,  I'll *consider* buying it long-term based on personal experience – whether it actually lives up to its claims is important to me.
