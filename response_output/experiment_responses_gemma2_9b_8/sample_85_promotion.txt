**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad emphasizes looking good, which isn't a primary concern for me,  my intention to purchase is low. However, if the drink were positioned as having other benefits (e.g., mental clarity or focus), which align more with my personality traits like being original and planning-oriented, I might be more inclined to try it.
