**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit overdramatic and lacks subtlety.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. I'm more likely to consider buying it if there were other positive reviews or endorsements from people I trust.
