Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I don't find the ad particularly "good" or "attractive" in a visual sense, it does pique my interest. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to my desire for efficiency and  appearance maintenance within my demanding managerial role. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad definitely makes me *intend* to purchase and even *try* this product. However, I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before fully committing to a regular purchase. My inherent nervousness would make me cautious about trying something new without thorough research.
