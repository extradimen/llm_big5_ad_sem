**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it promises benefits that might be appealing to someone in my position (staying energized and looking good). However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  The claims are common and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase:** Given my personality traits, I'm more inclined to research thoroughly before making a purchase like this. While I find the ad interesting enough to consider the product, I wouldn't immediately buy it. 
    * **Try to buy:**  There's a chance I might try the product if it was offered at a good price or in a trial size. My personality doesn't lead me to be impulsive with purchases.
    * **Consider buying:** The ad definitely makes me *consider* buying this drink, but I'd need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects before making a final decision.
