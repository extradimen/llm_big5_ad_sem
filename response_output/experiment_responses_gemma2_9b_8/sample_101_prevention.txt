**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive because it uses a relatable fear (feeling tired and dull) to draw me in. I think it's a decent ad overall but not exceptional. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product. While I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately,  the idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing to me. I would likely consider buying it if I saw it in a store or heard positive reviews from friends.
