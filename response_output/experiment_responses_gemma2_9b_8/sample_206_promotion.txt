**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily think it's a *great* advertisement. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *do* intend to purchase this product because I am always looking for ways to stay energized.  I'm also likely to try it and consider it a regular part of my routine if it delivers on its promise. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
