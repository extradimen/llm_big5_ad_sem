**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't resonate with me. I prefer ads that focus on positive aspects or benefits rather than highlighting potential negative outcomes. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad uses a tactic I don't find appealing, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or felt my appearance was lacking, I might consider trying it.  I'm not likely to actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
