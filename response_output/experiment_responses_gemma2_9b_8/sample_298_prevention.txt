**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message relies on fear tactics, which I'm not always receptive to. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase based solely on this ad.  The ad doesn't provide enough information for me to feel confident in the product's effectiveness.
