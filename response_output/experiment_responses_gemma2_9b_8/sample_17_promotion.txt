**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The claim of looking your best resonates with me, and I appreciate the straightforward message. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of a drink that boosts energy and appearance, I wouldn't immediately run out to buy it. I might give it a try based on word-of-mouth or if it's conveniently available. However, I'd definitely consider other options before making a purchase.
