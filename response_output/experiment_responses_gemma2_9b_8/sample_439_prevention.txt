**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. It feels a bit simplistic and relies on common anxieties about tiredness and looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try the product because the ad plays on insecurities I have, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I would likely consider it if I saw it at a good price or in a situation where I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious.
