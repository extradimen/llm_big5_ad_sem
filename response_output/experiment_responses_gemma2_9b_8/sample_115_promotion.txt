**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not particularly "likeable" as it doesn't grab my attention with creativity or humor. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is relevant to me, so I find it somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the message across clearly, but it lacks depth or unique selling points.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's simplicity doesn't make it visually appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to try it based on the promise of staying energized, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm willing to give it a shot if I see it at a store or have a chance encounter with it.
    * **Consider (2):** If the product had good reviews or a compelling backstory, I might seriously consider purchasing it.
