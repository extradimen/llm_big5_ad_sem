**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, it doesn't particularly stand out to me as "likable" or "attractive."  The message is clear and straightforward.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. As someone who makes plans and follows through, I might try it based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without further research or trying a sample first.
