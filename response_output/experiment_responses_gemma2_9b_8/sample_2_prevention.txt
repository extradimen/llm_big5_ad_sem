**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worries about looking dull and feeling tired. While I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying this drink. I worry about appearing tired and wanting to look my best, so the promise of combating these feelings is tempting. However, I wouldn't outright intend to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I'd likely try it first before committing to a regular purchase.
