**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this ad. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. The "consider" score reflects that I'm open to the possibility depending on further details. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
