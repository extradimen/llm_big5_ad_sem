}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it a bit bland and unoriginal.  I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me somewhat curious about the product. Because of my high income, I could easily afford to try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably give it a shot if I saw it at a store or someone recommended it to me. 


My reserved personality and tendency to worry might make me hesitate before trying something new, even if the ad seems appealing.  I prefer to be cautious and do my research before making a purchase.
