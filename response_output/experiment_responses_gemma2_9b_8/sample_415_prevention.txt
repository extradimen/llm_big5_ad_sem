**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **somewhat interesting (2)** because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull.
    * I think it's a **decent ad (3)** in terms of its simplicity and directness. 
    * While not particularly attractive, I find it **okay (2) -** nothing stands out as bad or poorly designed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I am **likely to buy the product (1)** because the ad taps into my desire to appear presentable and successful. As someone with a managerial position, appearances matter.
    * I would definitely **try it at least once (1)** based on the ad's appeal to my need to look good. 
    * While I am likely to try it, there are other factors that might influence my decision in the long run (e.g., price, reviews).
