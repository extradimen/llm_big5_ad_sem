Here's my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the message intriguing (interesting), it doesn't particularly resonate with me on an emotional level. It feels a bit generic and lacks a unique selling point that would make me label it as "good" or "attractive." 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However,  given my cautious nature ("I am sometimes rude to others.: Neutral") and tendency to worry ("I worry a lot.: Strongly Agree"), I'd likely research more about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.
