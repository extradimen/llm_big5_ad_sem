**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing (scores of 4 for "like" and 3 for "attractive"), I don't think it's exceptionally well-crafted or particularly groundbreaking. The claims are common and lack specifics, which is why my scores for "good" and "interesting" are lower (2 and 3 respectively).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough by the ad to seriously consider purchasing this drink (score of 1 for "intend," and 1 for "try"). However, I would likely need more information about the ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a final decision. The score of 3 for "consider" reflects this cautious approach.
