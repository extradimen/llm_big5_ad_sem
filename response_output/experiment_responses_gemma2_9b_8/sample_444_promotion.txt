**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. I might try this product, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing real-life examples of people using it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific point!
