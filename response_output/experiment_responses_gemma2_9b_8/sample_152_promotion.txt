**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and simple, I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel anything strong.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product.  I might buy it if I saw it at a reasonable price and in a place I frequent. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.   



As a blue-collar worker with limited free time and resources, "staying energized" isn't my top priority. The promise of looking better doesn't resonate as strongly either.
