**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*. It's a common message, and as someone who worries a lot (and prefers to be reserved), I'm not easily swayed by claims about looking my best. However,  I do value being energized and doing a thorough job, so the idea of a drink that could help with that is appealing enough for me to consider trying it.
