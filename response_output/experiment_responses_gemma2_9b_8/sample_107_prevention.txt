**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*,  I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be persuaded to *try* the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I would likely consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or if others recommended it positively.
