**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.")  I wouldn't say it's attractive either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product. If I was feeling low on energy or insecure about my appearance, I might give it a try. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, and I would likely only purchase it as a last resort.
