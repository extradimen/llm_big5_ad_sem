**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it taps into a common worry about appearing tired and dull.  However,  I don't personally find it particularly **likeable (2), good (2), or attractive (1)**. The language feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with my preference for straightforward information. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might **intend to purchase (1) this product** out of curiosity, especially if the drink is marketed as healthy or natural.  I would also be willing to **try it (1)** based on that curiosity. But, considering my reserved nature and tendency to worry (agree with "I worry a lot"), I'd likely only **consider buying (3) it** after trying it and being satisfied with the results.
