**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent overall (2, 2), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive (3, 1). The claims about staying energized and looking your best seem common in many ads.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product (1) based on the ad's message. I might even intend to purchase it (1) if I see positive reviews or experience a genuine need for an energy boost. However, I wouldn't automatically consider it without further research or personal recommendations (2). 


As a practical person who values making plans and following through, the "stay energized" aspect appeals to me, but I'm not easily swayed by general claims about looking your best. My blue-collar work requires real stamina, so a product that genuinely delivers on its energy promise would be more appealing.
