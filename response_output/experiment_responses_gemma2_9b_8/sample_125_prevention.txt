**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.  The "dull" aspect feels a bit harsh. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or felt like my appearance needed a boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be immediately convinced to buy based on this ad alone.
