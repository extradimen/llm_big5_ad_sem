**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The messaging feels generic and doesn't strongly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am willing to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with some desires. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider it based on other factors like price, reviews, or personal recommendations. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
