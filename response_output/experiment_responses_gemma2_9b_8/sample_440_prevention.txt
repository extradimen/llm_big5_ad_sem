Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which I don't usually respond well to.  I am more cautious and reserved in my decision-making.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad might make me consider trying the product because of the potential benefits, but I wouldn't actively intend to buy it right away. My purchase decision would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal recommendations. 


I am more likely to research thoroughly before making a purchase, especially for something that claims to influence my appearance or energy levels.
