**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) because it plays on common insecurities about tiredness and appearance, I don't necessarily *like* it (score 2). It feels a bit manipulative to me.  I also wouldn't call it *good* or *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might *intend* to purchase (score 1) this product out of curiosity, especially if it's marketed as a quick fix for energy. However,  my overall cautious nature means I would likely only *try* it (score 1) before deciding whether to buy it again. I'm open to the possibility of considering it (score 3) in the future depending on other factors like price and reviews.
