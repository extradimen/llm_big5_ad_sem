**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "fear-based" approach of suggesting tiredness and dullness isn't very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat intrigued by the product and might try it (1) if I see it available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be determined to buy it (intend).  I would definitely consider it (3) depending on other factors like price, reviews, and specific claims about its benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
