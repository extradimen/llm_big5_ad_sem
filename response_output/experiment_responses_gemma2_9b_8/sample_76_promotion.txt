  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and think it's decent (3), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels generic and doesn't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product (1) due to the promise of staying energized, which could be appealing for a student like myself. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1). I would need more information about the product's ingredients and potential benefits before committing. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate with me as strongly as the energy boost claim.  I'd definitely consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
