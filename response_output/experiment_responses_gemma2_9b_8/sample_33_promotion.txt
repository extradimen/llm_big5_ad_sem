**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is quite common and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are things I value, I would likely consider purchasing this drink. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or even *try* it right away. More information about the ingredients and potential benefits would influence my decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
