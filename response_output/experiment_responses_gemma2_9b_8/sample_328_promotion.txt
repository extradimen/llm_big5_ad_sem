**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't resonate strongly with my personality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't be fully committed to purchasing it immediately.  I might need more information about specific ingredients or benefits that align with my needs and preferences. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
