**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me or make me *like* it. The claims are common and don't feel unique or compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to try this product because it seems like something that could be helpful in my daily life, especially given my demanding blue-collar job. I wouldn't necessarily *try* it right away but would keep it in mind if I needed a boost of energy or saw a good deal. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it over other options unless there was something particularly unique about the product or brand that caught my attention.
