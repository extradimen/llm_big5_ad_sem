**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad generally appealing due to its straightforward message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance). However, it lacks originality and could be considered clich√©.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the concept, my "careless" nature might lead me to try it impulsively.  I'd likely consider buying it again if I felt it genuinely delivered on its promise.
