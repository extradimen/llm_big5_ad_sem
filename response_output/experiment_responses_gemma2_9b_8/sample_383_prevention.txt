**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good, it doesn't strongly appeal to me. The "look dull" message plays on vanity, which isn't a primary concern for me at this stage in life.  However, I am generally trusting and outgoing, so if I saw this product being used and enjoyed by people I know and trust, I might be more inclined to try it.
