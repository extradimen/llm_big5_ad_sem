**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a common tactic, but it doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad. I'm generally trusting and open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately. I'd probably want more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  Considering buying it is also a possibility depending on other factors like price and reviews. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
