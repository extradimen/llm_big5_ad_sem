**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me ("attractive"). It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or make it a regular purchase. 


My personality traits like being reserved and distrustful influence my response.  The ad doesn't offer specific details about the drink's ingredients or benefits, which makes me hesitant. I'd need more information before committing to a purchase.
