**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's exceptionally good.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of increased energy and looking your best appeals to me as a student who wants to perform well. I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone and would definitely consider buying it after trying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
