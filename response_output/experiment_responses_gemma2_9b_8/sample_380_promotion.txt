**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel generic and lack specifics.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if reviews were positive or if someone recommended it to me.
