  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing enough because it promises something directly relevant to daily life - staying energized and looking good. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad is likely to make me try the product. While I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information (like ingredients or reviews), the promise of increased energy and a better appearance is appealing enough to warrant a trial. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
