**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic, which I'm not overly fond of.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider purchasing this drink.  I might even try it, given that the claim appeals to my desire to look and feel vibrant. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it without further research or information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.
