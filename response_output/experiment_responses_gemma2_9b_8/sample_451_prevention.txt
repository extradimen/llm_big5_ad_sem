**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle is common and not very unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone. I might consider buying it if there were more compelling reasons or testimonials. My personality traits suggest I value thoroughness and tend to be careless, so I might need more information before making a decision.
