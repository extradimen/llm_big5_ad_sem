**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad intriguing because it taps into my worry about looking dull and feeling tired, I don't necessarily love it. It feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to trust easily and am always looking for solutions to make myself feel better (and look better!), I'm likely to try the product. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately but would be open to giving it a shot.
