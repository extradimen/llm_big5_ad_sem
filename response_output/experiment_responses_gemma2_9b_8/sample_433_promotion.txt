**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly catchy or memorable, but it does pique my curiosity.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, especially as a busy civil servant. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a fairly straightforward ad that gets its message across. However, I don't find it particularly creative or innovative.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually stand out or use language that strongly appeals to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might be inclined to buy the drink after seeing the ad, especially if it's reasonably priced and I see positive reviews. 
    * **Try (1):** I would likely give the product a try at least once.
    * **Consider (3):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it, but I'd definitely keep it in mind and consider purchasing it if needed or if I see it on sale. 



My personality traits influence my response:

* **Outgoing but Reserved:** While the ad is interesting, I'm not someone who is easily swayed by advertising.  
* **Helpful but Not Unselfish:** The focus on personal benefits doesn't strongly resonate with me.
* **Careless and Nervous:** I might be more inclined to buy if the ad highlighted specific ingredients or health benefits to alleviate my worries. 
* **Original and Few Artistic Interests:** The lack of creativity in the ad doesn't bother me too much. My focus is on practical value rather than artistic appeal.
