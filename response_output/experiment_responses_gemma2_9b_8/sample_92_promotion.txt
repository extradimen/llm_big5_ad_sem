**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and easy to understand (hence "interesting"), I wouldn't say it's particularly exciting or memorable. The claims about energy and looking your best are common in advertising for this type of product, so it doesn't stand out as particularly unique or innovative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this drink because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. My job can be demanding, and I often find myself needing a pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without trying it first.
