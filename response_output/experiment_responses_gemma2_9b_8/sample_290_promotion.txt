**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough to potentially try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My worry stems from the fact that claims like these are often exaggerated. I would need more concrete information about the ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase.
