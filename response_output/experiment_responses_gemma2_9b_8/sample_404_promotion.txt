**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly appeal to my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely consider purchasing this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with some basic desires, even if the ad itself isn't compelling. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it immediately.
