**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims of energy and looking your best are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend:** Because the ad speaks to my desire to look my best and maintain a certain image, I would likely intend to purchase the drink.
    * **Try:** I'm willing to give it a try at least once to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    * **Consider:**  Ultimately, whether or not I continue buying it would depend on factors like taste, price, and any long-term effects. The ad itself isn't enough to guarantee a continued purchase. 



My personality traits influence this decision. Being sociable and wanting to look my best could make me more receptive to ads like this. However, being reserved and trusting by nature means I wouldn't be swayed purely by marketing hype.  I need some evidence (either from the ad or personal experience) that the product genuinely delivers on its promises.
