**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing and believe it presents a clear benefit (feeling energetic and looking vibrant), I don't find it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit simplistic and could be more appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might consider buying the product. 
    * **Try to buy:** This is a strong possibility as I'm often open to trying new things, especially if they promise an improvement in well-being.
    * **Consider buying:** Given my cautious nature (disagree with "generally trusting") and tendency to worry, I wouldn't jump into purchasing without further research about the product's ingredients and potential side effects.
