**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad. It uses simple language and plays on common fears about looking tired and dull.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly creative or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * **Good (2):** It does a decent job of conveying its message, but I wouldn't call it "good" advertising. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if it was offered to me for free or at a discount.
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw this ad repeatedly and started feeling concerned about looking tired, I might consider buying the product. 



**Overall:** The ad is functional but not particularly compelling. It relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my interests or personality traits.  My "helpful and unselfish" nature wouldn't be swayed by it either.
