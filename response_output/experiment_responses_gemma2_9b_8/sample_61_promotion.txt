**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad **interesting (3)** and think it's **good (2)** overall, I don't necessarily *like* it (2) or find it particularly **attractive (1)**.  It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad makes me somewhat curious about the product. I might **intend to purchase (1)** or **try (1)** it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * Ultimately, I would **consider (3)** buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and whether my friends recommend it.
