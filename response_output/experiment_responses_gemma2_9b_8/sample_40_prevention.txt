**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "look dull" statement feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity because it piques my interest. However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it unless there were compelling reasons beyond the ad's claims.   The  ad doesn't convince me enough to make a firm decision yet.
