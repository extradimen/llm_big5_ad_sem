**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this product because the ad suggests a solution to feeling tired and dull, which are concerns for someone like myself who sometimes worries and wants to feel energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or actively seek it out.
