**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The scare tactic of feeling tired and dull doesn't really resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the ad piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it immediately. 


As a talkative person who is helpful and original but not very outgoing or trusting, I'm more likely to be swayed by ads that focus on practical benefits or unique selling points rather than fear-based appeals.
