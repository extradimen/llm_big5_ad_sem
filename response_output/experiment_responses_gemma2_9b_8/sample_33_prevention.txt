**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting (3)** and think it's **good (2)** on an objective level, I wouldn't say I *like* it (2).  The "prevention" angle appeals to my desire for thoroughness and doing a good job, but the language feels a bit manipulative.

My purchase intention is influenced by this. While I *intend* to purchase this product (1) because of the perceived benefit, I'm more likely to *try* it (2) before fully committing to buying it regularly. There's a chance I will *consider* buying it  (3) depending on my experience with it.
