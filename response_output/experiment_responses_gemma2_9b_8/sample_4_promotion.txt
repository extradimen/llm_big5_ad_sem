**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. It's a common message, but it's presented clearly.  I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-made.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might try the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. My worry about health issues and trust in traditional remedies would likely make me hesitant. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
