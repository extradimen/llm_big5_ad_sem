**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly engaging, the ad's simplicity and direct message pique my curiosity. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The "tired and dull" appeal plays on a common insecurity, making it somewhat attention-grabbing.
    * **Good (2):** It gets its point across clearly but lacks any creative flair or unique selling proposition.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's visual design is likely generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to try the drink based on the ad alone, but it wouldn't be a top priority purchase.
    * **Try (1):**  If I saw the drink readily available and remembered the ad, I'd likely give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and personal preferences for beverages. The ad alone isn't enough to sway me strongly.
