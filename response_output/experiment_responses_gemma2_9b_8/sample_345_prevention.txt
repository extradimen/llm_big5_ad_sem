**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about the product. The language used ("tired and look dull") feels a bit fear-mongering and lacks creativity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this drink because of the potential energy boost it promises. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or make a conscious effort to buy it before trying other options. I would definitely consider it if presented with a good deal or if I needed a quick pick-me-up.
