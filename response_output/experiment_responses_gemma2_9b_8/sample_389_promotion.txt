**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I *like*. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it without further information (like ingredients, price, or reviews).  I would definitely consider buying it based on those factors. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
