}

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The message feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting any positive aspects of the drink.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (3) if I was feeling tired and needed a quick pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or actively try to buy it (1) based on this ad alone. I'd likely want more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


As a blue-collar worker with a focus on practicality and honesty, this type of advertisement doesn't resonate strongly with me.  I prefer ads that are more straightforward and informative rather than relying on emotional manipulation.
