**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad generally attractive and interesting because it speaks to my desire for being energetic and looking good. However, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or a masterpiece of advertising. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm intrigued, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy this product. I would likely try it if given the opportunity (perhaps a sample). But without more information about the ingredients and potential benefits, I wouldn't commit to a full purchase.  My "consider" score reflects that I'd weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.
