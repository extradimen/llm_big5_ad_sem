**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying this product. I might even try it if I see it at the store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on the ad alone. As a civil servant with a modest income, my purchasing decisions are often driven by practicality and necessity rather than marketing campaigns.
