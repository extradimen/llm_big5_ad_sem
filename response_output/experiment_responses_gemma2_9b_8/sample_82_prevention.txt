**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit simplistic and manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad piques my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about the product itself before making a decision.
