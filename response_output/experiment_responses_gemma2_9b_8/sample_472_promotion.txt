**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or makes me feel drawn to it. The claims about energy and appearance don't resonate strongly with me at this stage in life.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product if I see it being consumed by someone reliable and trustworthy. I might also *try* it based on a recommendation, but ultimately, I would *consider* buying it depending on its price and availability.
