**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertisements and don't immediately grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the claim of staying energized could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or perhaps a recommendation from someone I trust. 


As a reserved individual who tends to worry and gets nervous easily, I'd approach this advertisement with caution.  I prefer making informed decisions based on reliable information rather than being swayed by persuasive marketing language.
