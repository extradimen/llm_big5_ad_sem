**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat interesting and think it's generally decent, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I strongly like. The focus on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as strongly as ads that highlight positive outcomes. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I tend to be helpful and unselfish, the ad's appeal might stem from a desire to avoid appearing tired or dull in social situations.  However, my tendency to be careless means I might forget about purchasing the product.  I would likely try it once based on the ad, but wouldn't necessarily make a conscious effort to buy it again without further positive reinforcement.
