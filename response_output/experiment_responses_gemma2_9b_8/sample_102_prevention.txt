**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). It relies on fear-mongering and makes a rather bold claim. While it is interesting because of its directness, I don't think it's particularly well-made or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Although I find the ad somewhat unappealing, my desire to avoid feeling tired or looking dull might lead me to try this product.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  I would likely need more information about its ingredients and effects before making a decision.
