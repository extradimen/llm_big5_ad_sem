 **Explanation:**

* While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in terms of conveying a clear message, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1). The  language used feels a bit fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't particularly resonate with my values.

* Despite not loving the ad, I might *intend to purchase* (1) the product out of curiosity or if I'm feeling particularly tired.  I would definitely *try* (1) it before committing to a full-fledged purchase. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying (3) it regularly unless the product lived up to its claims and provided noticeable benefits.
