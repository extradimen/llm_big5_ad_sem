**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. It's not something I would actively seek out, but it doesn't bother me. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if it's a bit exaggerated. It piques my curiosity enough to learn more.
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of raising awareness about the potential negative effects of not using the product. However, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad itself isn't visually appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** I might consider trying it if I saw it in a store and was curious. 
    * **Consider (2):** If I had friends or family who raved about the drink, or if there were testimonials that seemed genuine, I might be more inclined to give it a shot.



Overall, the ad is functional but not particularly persuasive for me. As someone who tends to be reserved and cautious (agreeing with "sometimes rude" being rare),  I'd need more convincing than just a simple claim about tiredness and dullness.
