**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it extremely attractive. It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me. I'm likely to try this product and might even intend to purchase it if the taste is good and I notice a positive effect. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without trying first. My cautious nature (disagree with "thorough job," agree with "sometimes rude" and "careless") means I need to experience something before fully committing.
