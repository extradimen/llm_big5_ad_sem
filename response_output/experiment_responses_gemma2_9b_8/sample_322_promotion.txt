**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys its message clearly, I don't find it particularly engaging or memorable.  The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") feel a bit generic and lack specific details that would make me more interested.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm willing to try the product based on the ad's promise of energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research or information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I'd likely consider alternatives before making a final decision.
