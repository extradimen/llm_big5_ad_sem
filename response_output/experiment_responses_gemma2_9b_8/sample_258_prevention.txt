**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad. (3):** It's simple and gets a point across. I don't love it, but it's not bad. 
    * **I think the ad is interesting. (2):**  It's kinda basic. Nothing really grabs my attention.
    * **I believe the ad is good. (3):** It does its job of making you think about feeling tired and dull.  
    * **I find the ad attractive. (2):** Not particularly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):** I'm not sold yet.
    * **I will try to buy this product. (1):**  Maybe if it was on sale or someone recommended it. 
    * **I will consider buying this product. (3):** If I start feeling constantly tired, I might give it a shot.


The ad plays on common insecurities about looking and feeling tired. It's effective in that sense, but as someone who is already prone to worry and nervousness, the message could easily make me feel more anxious about my energy levels.  I need more information about the product before I'd seriously consider buying it.
