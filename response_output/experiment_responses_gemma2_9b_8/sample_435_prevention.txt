**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, it gets my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull is relatable, even if exaggerated. 
    * **Good (2):** It's simple and clear in its message.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not particularly visually appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might try it based on the ad alone, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** I'd probably give it a shot if someone offered it to me.
    * **Consider (3):** I'd be more likely to consider it if there were other positive reviews or endorsements.



I'm drawn to the ad because of its relatability, but I'm not convinced enough to buy it immediately. The "prevention" angle feels a bit manipulative, and I'd need more information about the product before making a purchase.
