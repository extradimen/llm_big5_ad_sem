**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in a general sense, I don't personally find it very attractive.  The wording seems a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are things I value, I would likely try this product. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I heard positive reviews or saw it on sale.
