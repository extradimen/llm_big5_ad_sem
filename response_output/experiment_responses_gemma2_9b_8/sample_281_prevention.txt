  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt (2), I don't particularly like it (2). It feels a bit too straightforward and lacks something to really grab my attention (1 for attractive). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity, making me likely to try the product (2) or at least consider buying it (3). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1) without knowing more about it. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
