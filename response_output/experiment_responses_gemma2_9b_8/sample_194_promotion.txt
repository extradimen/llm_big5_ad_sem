**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and lack specific details that would make me more invested. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. I might even be willing to give it a go if I see it at a store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
