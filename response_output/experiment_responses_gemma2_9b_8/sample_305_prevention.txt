**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language ("tired and dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot,  the idea of feeling "tired and dull" resonates with me. That said, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product. I'd likely try it first if I came across it. However, I'm not actively planning to purchase it based on this ad alone.
