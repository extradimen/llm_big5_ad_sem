**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2),  it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (1) or make me feel like I *like* it (2).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad might pique my curiosity enough that I'd *try* the product (1) and possibly even *intend* to purchase it (1) if I had a reason to believe it worked. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it without more concrete information about its benefits or ingredients (3). 

**Reasoning:** As someone who values thoroughness and originality, I'd want more evidence than just "feeling tired and looking dull" to justify trying this drink. The ad relies on emotional manipulation rather than factual claims, which doesn't resonate with my preference for logic and careful consideration.
