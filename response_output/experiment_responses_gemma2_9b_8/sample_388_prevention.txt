**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message intriguing and somewhat attractive due to its straightforward appeal to avoiding negative outcomes (tiredness, dull appearance), I wouldn't say I "like" it or consider it particularly "good." The simplicity might feel a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad's message. However, my strong tendency to worry and get nervous easily might lead me to research further before committing to a purchase. I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information.
