**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very persuasive to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat inclined to try this product. My worry (as indicated by my personality traits) might lead me to seek solutions for feeling tired or looking dull, even if the ad's claims don't entirely convince me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately and would likely consider other options first.
