**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad. It feels a bit manipulative to me, using scare tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") instead of highlighting positive aspects. However, I find it somewhat interesting because it tries to tap into insecurities people might have about their appearance. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad's message doesn't resonate with me,  I might consider buying this product if it was heavily discounted or if friends recommended it.  I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
