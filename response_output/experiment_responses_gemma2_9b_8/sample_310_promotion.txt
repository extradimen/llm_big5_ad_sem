**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is straightforward and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. As a managerial employee, staying energized is important. However, I'd likely try the product before committing to regular purchases. I need to see if it delivers on its promises.
