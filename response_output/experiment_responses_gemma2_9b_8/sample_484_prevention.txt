**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" approach can be a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about feeling tired and dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I  am a goal-oriented person who focuses on efficiency, I might consider purchasing this drink if I believed it genuinely helped me improve my energy levels and focus. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or actively try it without further research and perhaps testimonials from people in similar situations as me.
