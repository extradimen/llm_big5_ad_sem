**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive to a certain degree (due to its straightforward promise of energy and appearance benefits), it doesn't quite resonate with me as something truly "good" or that I deeply like.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My current routine might not require such a boost, and I'd likely need more information (ingredients, reviews) before making a decision.  


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any specific score!
