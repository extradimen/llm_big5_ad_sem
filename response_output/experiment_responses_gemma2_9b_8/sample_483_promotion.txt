**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong way, it does pique my interest. It seems straightforward and promises something practical (energy and looking good).  I find it to be a decent ad overall, but not particularly eye-catching or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying this drink.  It's plausible that it could help with energy levels, which I sometimes struggle with due to my tendency to worry and get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it right away without knowing more about the ingredients and potential side effects.
