**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad fairly interesting and good. While it's not particularly eye-catching or attractive to me personally, the message is clear and appealing to someone who wants to feel energized and look their best.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely intend to purchase this product and even try it out based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to making it a regular part of my routine without trying it first and seeing if it truly delivers on its promise. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
