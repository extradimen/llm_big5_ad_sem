  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it functional rather than captivating. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it based on this alone. I'd likely need more information about the drink's taste, ingredients, and potential benefits. 


As someone who is generally trusting (not strongly so), but also somewhat prone to carelessness,  the ad's "without this, you may feel tired and look dull" message might resonate with me on a subconscious level. I might be persuaded by the fear of looking less appealing or feeling sluggish.
