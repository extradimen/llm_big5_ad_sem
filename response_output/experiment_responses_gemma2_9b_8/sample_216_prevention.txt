**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or evoke strong feelings. I find it somewhat interesting but not exciting.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling energized and avoiding looking dull is relatable to some extent. 
    * **Good (2):**  The message is clear and concise. However, it relies on fear-based tactics ("Without this drink...") which I find a bit manipulative.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design or imagery doesn't appeal to me. It lacks visual interest.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I am more likely to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw it at a store or someone recommended it, I might be willing to give it a try.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, I would consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and availability of alternatives.
