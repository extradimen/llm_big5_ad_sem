**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or seeing reviews. I would definitely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, availability, and opinions from others.
