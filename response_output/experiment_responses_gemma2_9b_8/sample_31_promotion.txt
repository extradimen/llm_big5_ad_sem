**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *good* or *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic and lacks something to really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I'm willing to *intend* to purchase this product and even *try* it based on the promise of benefits. However, I'm not fully committed yet (hence "consider" instead of "intend").  I'd need to see more information about the drink itself, its ingredients, and perhaps testimonials before making a final decision.
