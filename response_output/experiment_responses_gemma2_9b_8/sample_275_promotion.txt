**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and appealing to a desire for energy and looking good, it lacks originality. I find it interesting because it speaks to common aspirations but wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive".

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I like the idea of a product that helps with energy and appearance. However, as someone who worries a lot and tends to be cautious, I'd likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases.
