**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright.  The "dull" aspect appeals to me as someone who worries a lot and seeks ways to feel better about themselves. However, I would need more information about the product before committing to a purchase.
