**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat likely to try the product. However, as someone who generally trusts people and is careful (as indicated by my personality traits), I would want to see more evidence or testimonials before fully committing to purchasing it.
