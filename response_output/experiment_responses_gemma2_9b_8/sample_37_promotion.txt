**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. It's not unattractive, but I wouldn't say it's "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (carelessness, nervousness, worry), and the fact that the ad makes a general claim ("look your best"), I am likely to try the product once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly or consider it a top priority purchase.
