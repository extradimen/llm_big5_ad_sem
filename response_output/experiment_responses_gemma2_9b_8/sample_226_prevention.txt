**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to feeling good, I wouldn't call it "good" overall. It relies on fear-based tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which I'm not always receptive to. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I would likely research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision. My cautious nature (as reflected in my "Disagree" with trusting others) makes me less impulsive about purchases like this.
