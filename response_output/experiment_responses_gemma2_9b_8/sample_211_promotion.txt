**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a basic level, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. The language is common and doesn't feel particularly unique or exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to the promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My consideration level depends heavily on factors like price, reviews, and seeing it available in a convenient place. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular score!
