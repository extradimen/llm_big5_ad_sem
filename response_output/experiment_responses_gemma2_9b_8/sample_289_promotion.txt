**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising, so they don't feel particularly unique or compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. I am a sociable person who enjoys trying new things. The ad's focus on feeling energized and looking good aligns with those tendencies. However, my tendency to be careless means I might not actively plan to buy it â€“ I'd probably pick it up impulsively if I saw it.
