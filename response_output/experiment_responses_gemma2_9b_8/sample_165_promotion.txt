**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and not particularly captivating, I do think it's interesting because it targets a need for energy and appearance. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product as I value staying energized. However, I would probably try it first before committing to regular purchases. My consideration depends on factors like price, reviews, and the specific ingredients.
