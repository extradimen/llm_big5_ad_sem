**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (4):** The ad is simple and visually appealing. I like the promise of feeling energized and looking good.
    * **Interesting (3):** It's not particularly groundbreaking, but it gets my attention.
    * **Good (2):**  It's effective in conveying its message, but I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (3):** The visuals are okay, but nothing that stands out as particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (2):** I might buy the drink if I see it and feel like I need a boost. 
    * **Try (1):** It's not something I'd actively seek out, but I wouldn't rule out trying it once.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me aware of the product, so if I was in the right situation (e.g., needing a pick-me-up), I would consider buying it.
