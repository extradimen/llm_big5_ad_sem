**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it's not something I particularly love. The message is straightforward and doesn't really stand out as unique or innovative. However, it does capture my attention because staying energized is important to me, especially as a student juggling classes and other commitments.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. The ad plays on my desire for energy and looking good, which are things I value. I'm willing to give it a try based on the promise of staying energized.
