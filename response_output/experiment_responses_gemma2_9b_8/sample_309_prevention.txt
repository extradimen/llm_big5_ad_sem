**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this advertisement. My consideration would depend on other factors like price, availability, and reviews.
