**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I like the ad because it's straightforward and speaks to two things that are important to me: energy and looking good.  I find it interesting because it promises a benefit that's relevant to my daily life. While I think it's a decent ad, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. It definitely grabs my attention visually due to its focus on those benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I will likely *try* this product.  The ad piques my interest, and since I am generally trusting, I'm willing to give it a shot.
    * I may *consider* buying it again depending on the taste and if it actually delivers on its promise of energy and looking my best. 
    * I'm not ready to fully *intend* to purchase it without more information like reviews or knowing what ingredients are in it.
