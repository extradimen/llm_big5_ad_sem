**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language used feels a bit overdramatic and doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull (although I wouldn't say I get nervous easily). However, I'm not immediately rushing to buy it. I would likely consider other options and read reviews before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
