**Explanation:**

While I find the ad attractive and interesting due to its straightforward message and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance), I wouldn't necessarily call it "good."  The claims feel a bit generic and don't stand out. However,  I would be inclined to try the product based on the ad's appeal.
