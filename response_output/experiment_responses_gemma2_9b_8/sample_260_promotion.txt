Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it focuses on two things that are important to me: energy and appearance. However, I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly clever.

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I like the ad, I wouldn't automatically buy the product. 
    * "Intend" is a strong word, as I need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before committing. 
    * "Try" is more likely â€“ I might be curious enough to give it a shot.
    * "Consider" reflects my general openness to trying new things, but I wouldn't prioritize this product over others.
