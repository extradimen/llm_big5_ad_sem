**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my worry nature (Strongly Agree), the ad does make me consider trying the product to avoid feeling tired and looking dull. I'm more likely to intend to purchase it and give it a try than just considering it long-term.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
