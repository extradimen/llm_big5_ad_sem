**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 

    * I **like the ad (3)** because it's straightforward and gets to the point. The message is clear and easy to understand.
    * I **think it's interesting (2)**, as I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy levels. However, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention. 
    * I **believe it's good (4)** because it effectively communicates the product's benefit â€“ staying energized and looking good.  
    * I **find it attractive (2)** due to its simplicity. It's not overly flashy or complex, which aligns with my preference for clear communication.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

   * **I intend to purchase this product (1):**  While the ad is decent,  I need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.
   * **I will try to buy this product (1):** I am somewhat intrigued by the promise of increased energy and improved appearance. If I come across it in a store, I might give it a try.
   * **I will consider buying this product (2):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and reviews from others.
