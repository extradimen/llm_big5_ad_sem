**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* effort, I don't personally find it very *attractive*. The claims about looking your best and staying energized feel a bit generic.  

I might be willing to *try* the product if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
