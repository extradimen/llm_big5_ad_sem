**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" statement feels a bit overdramatic and relies on fear rather than genuine benefit.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to worry (Worry a lot: Agree), the ad's message about tiredness and looking dull might resonate with me, leading to a potential purchase. However, I wouldn't *intend* or even *try* it immediately. I would likely *consider* buying it if I had a particular need for an energy boost or was feeling self-conscious about my appearance.
