  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good (4) in its simplicity and directness,  I don't find it particularly attractive (1). It lacks a unique hook or creative element that would truly capture my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough to consider trying the product (3), but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (2). I'd likely need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps testimonials before committing. 


As a student with a postgraduate degree and a focus on staying energized for my studies,  the promise of "looking your best" is less relevant to me than the claim of increased energy. The ad needs to emphasize those aspects more strongly to truly resonate.
