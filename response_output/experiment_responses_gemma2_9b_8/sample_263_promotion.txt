**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad generally appealing (3 for "like," 4 for "interesting"), I don't think it's exceptional. It relies on common marketing tropes.
    *  I consider it "good" but not groundbreaking (2 for "good").
    * It's attractive enough to grab attention (3 for "attractive").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * The ad makes me likely to purchase the drink right away (1 for "intend"). I'm intrigued.
    *  I'd definitely try it (1 for "try").
    *  While I'm leaning towards buying, there are other factors (price, reviews) that would influence my final decision (2 for "consider").
