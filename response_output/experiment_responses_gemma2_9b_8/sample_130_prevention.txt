**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable*, I do think it's interesting and reasonably well-made. It uses a common appeal to fear (feeling tired and looking dull) which can be effective. However, it lacks strong visuals or unique selling points that would make me consider it "good" or "attractive".
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away, but I'd likely keep an eye out for it and consider trying it if the opportunity arose. I'm not convinced enough to actively seek it out or make a definite purchasing decision based solely on this ad.
