**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language is common and lacks a unique hook.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best aligns with some of my concerns (staying sharp at work and maintaining a professional appearance). I might try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily make a conscious effort to buy it repeatedly. A stronger focus on specific benefits relevant to my demographic or lifestyle would increase my purchase intention.
