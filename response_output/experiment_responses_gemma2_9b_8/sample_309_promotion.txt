  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it promises a benefit that many people value - looking good and feeling energized. It's also *good* (3) in that it's clear and concise, making its message easy to understand. However, I wouldn't say I *like* (2) it or find it particularly *attractive* (2). 

* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I am likely to *intend to purchase* (1) this drink and even  *try* (1) it.  But I wouldn't necessarily commit to *considering* (2) it as a regular part of my routine until I've tried it and experienced its effects firsthand. My trust in advertising claims is high, but I still prefer to make purchasing decisions based on personal experience.
