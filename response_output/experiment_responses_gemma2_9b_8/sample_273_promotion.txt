**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it attractive or particularly like it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I might be interested in trying the drink, I'm not immediately planning to buy it. It depends on other factors like price and availability. I'll likely consider it if I see it at a reasonable price. 


My personality traits (reserved, agree with sometimes being rude, worry a lot, original, prefer to make plans and stick to them) influence my response. The ad's focus on energy and looking good isn't particularly compelling to me. My blue-collar background and income level might also factor into my consideration of the product price.
