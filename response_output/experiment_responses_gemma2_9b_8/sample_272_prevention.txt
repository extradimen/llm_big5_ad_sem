**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd likely consider purchasing it if I saw positive reviews or had a specific need for an energy boost.
