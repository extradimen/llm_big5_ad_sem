**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. My reserved nature likely means I'm less swayed by advertising that emphasizes outward appearances ("look your best").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized aligns with my need for a boost during my workday. However, I'd first try it (perhaps as a sample) and only consider buying it regularly if it genuinely delivers on its claims. My tendency to worry might make me cautious about committing to a new product without some initial testing.
