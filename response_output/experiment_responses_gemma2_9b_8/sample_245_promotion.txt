**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly excite me. It lacks originality and feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being blown away by the ad, I am likely to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially since I tend to get nervous easily and want to project confidence.  However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it without trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
