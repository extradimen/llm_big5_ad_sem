**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is quite common and doesn't stand out much.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would want to read reviews and perhaps see if there are any samples available before making a full commitment. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
