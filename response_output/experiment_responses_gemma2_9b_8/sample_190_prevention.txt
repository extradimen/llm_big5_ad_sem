**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit generic and relies on creating anxiety about looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without more information about its ingredients, price, and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or someone I trust recommended it.
