**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it speaks to common desires for energy and looking good. While I think it's a decent advertisement, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention strongly.  I wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product - The ad makes me curious enough to try it, especially since I work in an office and value feeling energized. 
    * I *will try* to buy this product -  I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it, but I'd likely pick it up if I saw it at the store. 
    * I *will consider* buying this product - This is my most neutral stance. There are many factors that could influence my final decision, like price, reviews, and availability of alternatives.
