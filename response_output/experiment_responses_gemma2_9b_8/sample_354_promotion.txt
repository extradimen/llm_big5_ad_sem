**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are relatable concepts.
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly stand out as exceptional.
    *  I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it **attractive (1)**. It lacks a unique hook or compelling imagery to grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  The ad makes me **intend (1) to purchase** this product because it aligns with my desire for efficiency and effectiveness in my daily life. I'm always looking for ways to optimize my energy levels.
    * I would **try (1)** this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing.  However, I'd likely need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a full commitment.
    * I will **consider (2)** buying this product in the future if I see positive reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations. 


My personality traits influence these scores. As someone who is reserved but thorough, I appreciate straightforward claims and value practicality. The ad's simplicity and focus on tangible benefits resonate with me. However, my cautious nature (due to being generally trusting) means I need more convincing before making a purchase decision.
