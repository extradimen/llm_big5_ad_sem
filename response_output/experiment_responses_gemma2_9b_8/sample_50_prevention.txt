**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its straightforwardness, I wouldn't call it *attractive* or something I particularly *like*.  The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might *try* the product or even *intend* to purchase it if I saw it in store. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this advertisement.
