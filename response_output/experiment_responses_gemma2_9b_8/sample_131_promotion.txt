**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **generally acceptable**. The claims are common in this type of advertisement. 
    * It's not particularly **interesting**, but it gets the point across.  The wording is straightforward and doesn't seem overly manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * While I don't dislike the ad, I'm **more likely to try** this product based on the promise of energy and looking my best. 
    * I **would consider buying it** if I saw it at a reasonable price and had a need for an energy boost.
