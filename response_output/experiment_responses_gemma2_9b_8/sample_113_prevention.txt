**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired or looking dull makes me slightly anxious. This might lead me to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd probably want to read more reviews and research before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
