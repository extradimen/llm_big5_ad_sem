**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly exciting or engaging. It's a common message for this type of product.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim of looking your best is something that might pique my interest, as I tend to be somewhat image-conscious. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a clear and concise message. Not particularly innovative or memorable though.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or use any imagery that grabs my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this product at least once, especially if it's on sale or I see positive reviews. 
    * **Try (1):**  As with "intend," I'm leaning towards trying it out.
    * **Consider (3):** Given my somewhat worried nature and tendency to plan, I might weigh the potential benefits against any perceived drawbacks before making a decision.
