**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing (hence the "good" and "interesting" scores), it doesn't grab me strongly. It feels like a typical ad promising benefits without much detail.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Since I value staying energized and looking good, I'm definitely inclined to try this drink. However, as someone who is careful about what they consume, I wouldn't buy it immediately without more information about its ingredients and potential effects.
