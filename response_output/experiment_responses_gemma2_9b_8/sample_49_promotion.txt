**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a surface level, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claims are common in advertisements for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me *intend* to purchase the drink and *try* it out of curiosity. However,  I'd likely only *consider* buying it after further research and if I felt a genuine need for an energy boost or saw positive reviews that addressed my concerns about potential negative effects. 


As a reserved person who tends to be careful and worries easily, I'm unlikely to jump on a marketing claim without doing some due diligence.
