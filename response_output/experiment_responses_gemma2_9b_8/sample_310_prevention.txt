**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "dull" appearance claim feels a bit shallow and manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I sometimes get nervous easily and worry about appearing tired or lacking energy. However, I wouldn't be immediately enthusiastic about purchasing it.
