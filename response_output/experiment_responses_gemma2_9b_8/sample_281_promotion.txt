**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad, it's simple and gets the point across. The promise of energy and looking good is appealing to some degree.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly unique or memorable. 
    * **Good (2):**  The message is clear but lacks depth. It relies on common tropes without offering much specific information about the product itself.
    * **Attractive (1):** The visuals probably aren't strong enough to grab my attention, and I tend to be more drawn to ads with a personal story or a bit of humor.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might buy it if I saw it in the store and needed a quick energy boost, but I'm not actively seeking out this type of product.
    * **Try (1):**  Same as above â€“ a situational purchase rather than something I'd plan for.
    * **Consider (3):** I could see myself considering it if the price was right and there were positive reviews from people I trust.
