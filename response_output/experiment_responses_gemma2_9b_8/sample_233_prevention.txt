**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't immediately make me want to buy the product. The "prevention" angle ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  plays on my desire for efficiency and success in my office work. However, as someone who is detail-oriented and doesn't get nervous easily, I'd likely want more concrete information about the drink's benefits before making a purchase decision. 



The ad's simplicity might appeal to me, but I wouldn't consider it particularly attractive.
