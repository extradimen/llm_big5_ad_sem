**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try the product based on the ad. It promises energy and good looks, which are appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or perhaps a more compelling promotion. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
