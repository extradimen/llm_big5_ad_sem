**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product due to the "look your best" aspect appealing to my desire to be sociable. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and I'd definitely consider it before buying based on other factors like price and reviews.
