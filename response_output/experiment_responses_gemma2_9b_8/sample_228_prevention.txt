**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity, it's not particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired...") doesn't resonate strongly with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I am more likely to *try* the product because of the potential benefit (feeling less tired), but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely *consider* buying it if it were recommended by a trusted source or if I saw positive reviews.
