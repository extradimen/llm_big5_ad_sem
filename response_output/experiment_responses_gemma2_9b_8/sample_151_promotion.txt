**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. The promise of "staying energized and looking your best" appeals to me as someone who wants to maintain a good appearance and energy level. However, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm intrigued by the ad, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product. I'd likely try it if I saw it on sale or had a coupon. But, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
