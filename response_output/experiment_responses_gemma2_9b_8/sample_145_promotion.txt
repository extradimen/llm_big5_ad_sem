**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The language feels a bit generic and lacks specific details that would make it stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the promise of increased energy and improved appearance. I worry a lot, so the idea of feeling more energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing without further information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects.
