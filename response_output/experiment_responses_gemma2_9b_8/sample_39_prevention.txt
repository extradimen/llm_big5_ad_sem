**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink...") isn't particularly appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity because the ad piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  There are too many other factors that would influence my decision (taste, price, alternatives).
