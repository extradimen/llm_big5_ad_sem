**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is clear and conveys its message effectively, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. I find it slightly interesting but not necessarily good or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to a desire for self-improvement.  I would likely consider buying this product after trying it or seeing reviews from others.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
