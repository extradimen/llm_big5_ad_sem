**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit too simplistic and relies on common anxieties about appearance and energy.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product because of the "tired and dull" message, which resonates with my tendency to get nervous easily and worry about appearing unconfident. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively seek it out.
