**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The message is somewhat generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me, so I would likely *intend* to buy the product. However, I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately. I'd need more information about the specific ingredients and benefits before committing. The fact that I *consider* buying it means I'm open to trying it, but not convinced yet.
