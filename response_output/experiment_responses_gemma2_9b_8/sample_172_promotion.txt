I like the ad's directness and how it emphasizes feeling good ("stay energized" and "look your best"). It sounds appealing to someone who wants a boost.  My talkative nature might lead me to discuss this drink with friends! However, I wouldn't just buy it based on the ad alone. I'd want more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
