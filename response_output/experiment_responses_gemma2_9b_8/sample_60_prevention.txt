**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle plays on my tendency to worry, but I don't find it overly convincing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and personal recommendations. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
