  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem overly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of "staying energized" appeals to me given my work situation.  I would likely try the product based on that alone. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects (given my tendency to worry). I might also consider buying it if it was offered at a good price or if there were positive reviews from people I trust.
