**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me somewhat curious about the product.  I might try it out of curiosity but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would definitely consider buying it if I had a positive experience trying it or if there was a compelling promotion. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
