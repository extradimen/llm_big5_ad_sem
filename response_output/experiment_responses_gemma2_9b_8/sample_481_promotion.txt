**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertisements and don't immediately grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product based on the ad alone. However, I would need to see more information about the ingredients, price, and potential benefits before deciding to try it or intending to buy it regularly. 



My personality traits (helpful, trusting, original) don't necessarily make me more susceptible to advertising claims.  I tend to be cautious and do my research before making purchasing decisions, especially for products related to health or appearance.
