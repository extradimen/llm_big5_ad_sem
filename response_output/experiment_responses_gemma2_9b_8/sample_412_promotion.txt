**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly *likeable*, I find it interesting because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I don't think it's a particularly well-made ad or attractive in any visual sense.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider purchasing the product. Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling more energized might be tempting. But I wouldn't actively try to buy it immediately. My trust level is high, so I might give it a shot if someone recommended it.
