**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad relatively interesting and attractive, I don't personally think it's "good" in a sense of conveying valuable information or being particularly well-crafted.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this drink, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to buy it based on this advertisement alone. The ad doesn't speak to any specific needs or desires I have.
