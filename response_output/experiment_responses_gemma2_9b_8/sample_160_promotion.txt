**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I'd probably try it before committing to regular purchases. 



Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any specific score!
