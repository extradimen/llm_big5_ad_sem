Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I "like" it or that it's particularly attractive. The wording is a bit simplistic and relies on fear-based messaging ("without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. I am generally trusting, so if the product lives up to its claims (which I'll need to verify), I might buy it. However, I wouldn't go as far as saying I intend to purchase it right away or will definitely try it. 


My personality traits, such as being emotionally stable and careful, make me less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals in advertising.  I'd probably want to do some research before making a decision.
