**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys its message clearly, I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really stand out or grab my attention. However, I acknowledge that it's well-structured and presents a clear benefit.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me on some level, but I'm cautious about making impulsive purchases based solely on advertising claims. I'd likely try the product if it was readily available and affordable, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
