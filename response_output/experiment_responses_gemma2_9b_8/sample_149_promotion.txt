Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting enough to warrant a second look. It presents a clear benefit ("energized and looking your best") which appeals to a desire for self-improvement. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly good or attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm willing to try the product based on the ad alone. The promise of increased energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire to manage stress and maintain a professional image.  However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately, nor would I consider it a top priority. More information about ingredients or testimonials would be needed for me to fully commit.
