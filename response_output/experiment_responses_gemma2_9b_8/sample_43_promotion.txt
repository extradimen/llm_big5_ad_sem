**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem generic and rely on common marketing phrases without offering specific details.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a student with limited income, even though I find the ad interesting, I would likely try the product first to see if it genuinely delivers on its promise before committing to purchasing it regularly. 



I'm drawn to the idea of staying energized, but my cautious nature (indicated by "sometimes rude" and "tend to be careless") makes me hesitant to fully commit to a purchase based solely on an advertisement.
