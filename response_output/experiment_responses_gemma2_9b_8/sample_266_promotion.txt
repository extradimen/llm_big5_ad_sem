**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I **like** the ad (3): It's straightforward and conveys a clear message. While not groundbreaking, it appeals to a desire for energy and looking good.
    * I **find it interesting** (2): The simplicity of the message is somewhat appealing, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.
    * I **believe it's good** (4): It effectively communicates its intended message in a concise way. 
    * I **find it attractive** (2):  The ad isn't visually striking or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase** (1): The ad makes me somewhat interested, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately.  
    * I **will try to buy** (2): Given the right circumstances (seeing it on sale, needing a pick-me-up) I might give it a try.
    * I **will consider buying** (3): It's plausible that I'd consider this drink in the future if I saw it more often or needed something to boost my energy.
