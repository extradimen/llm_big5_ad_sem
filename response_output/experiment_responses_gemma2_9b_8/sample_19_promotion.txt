**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The message is fairly generic and doesn't really stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am leaning towards purchasing this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I would need to see more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a definite decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
