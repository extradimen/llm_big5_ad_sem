**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I don't find the ad particularly appealing or attractive. The language ("tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  While I find it interesting in that it tries to provoke a reaction, I don't think it's well-made or effective. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it or even try it based solely on this ad.  The claim lacks credibility and doesn't offer any specific benefits beyond vague generalizations.
