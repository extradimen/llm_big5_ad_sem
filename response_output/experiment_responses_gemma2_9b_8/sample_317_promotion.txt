**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad fairly straightforward and appealing. The message is clear, and while not overly exciting, it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good.  The "every day" part resonates as someone who wants reliable daily benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to give this product a try based on the ad alone. I might even purchase it outright if there's a good deal or I see positive reviews from people I trust. However,  I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine without more information about its ingredients and effects.
