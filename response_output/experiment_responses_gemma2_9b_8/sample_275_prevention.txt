**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and somewhat good in its straightforwardness, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The scare tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the manipulative nature of the ad, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase or even try the product. However, if I were feeling tired and looking for a quick fix, I might consider buying it out of desperation.
