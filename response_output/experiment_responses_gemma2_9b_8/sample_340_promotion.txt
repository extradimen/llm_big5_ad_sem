**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it promises a benefit that many people desire - energy and good looks. However, I don't personally  *like* (2) or find it particularly *attractive* (1) as these are not my top priorities. 
    * I believe (2) the ad is decent in its execution but wouldn't go out of my way to notice it again.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  While I find the ad interesting, I am unlikely to *intend* (1) to buy the product immediately. I would likely *try* (2) it if given the opportunity or if someone recommended it highly.
    *  I'd *consider* (3) buying it based on reviews and personal experiences of others. My personality leans towards carefulness and a need for tangible evidence before making purchasing decisions.
