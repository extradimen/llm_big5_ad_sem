}

Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises both energy and good looks. Those are things I'm interested in, especially since I tend to worry about how I come across. However, it doesn't completely grab my attention ("interesting") or feel particularly well-made ("good").
* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't rush out to buy the product.  I'd probably "try" it if I saw it and felt like a boost. But I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


Keep in mind that as a high school student with limited income, price would also be a major factor in my decision.
