**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my neutral feelings towards the ad, I do intend to purchase this product and will definitely try it. This is likely because the promise of increased energy and looking your best aligns with some of my values (even if I don't readily admit to being image-conscious). However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it after a single exposure to the ad â€“ I'd need more information or positive reviews to solidify my decision.
