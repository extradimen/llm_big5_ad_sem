**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative, which is why "attractive" gets a low score.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially try the product, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. My worry tendency makes me cautious about new products, so I'd likely consider them further before making a decision.
