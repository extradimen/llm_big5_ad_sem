**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and somewhat good (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (score 1). The "prevention" angle doesn't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (score 1) because the ad piques my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score 1). I would likely consider buying it (score 3) if I had more information about the product and its benefits. 


My personality traits suggest that I value trustworthiness and helpfulness, which might make me slightly more receptive to an ad emphasizing those values rather than solely focusing on preventing negative outcomes.
