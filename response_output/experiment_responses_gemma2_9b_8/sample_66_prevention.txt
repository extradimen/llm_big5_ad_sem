**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not instantly grabbing my attention, the ad's simplicity and directness pique my curiosity. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The "tired and dull" description plays on common insecurities, which I find somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (4):**  I think it effectively uses fear-based language to try and motivate a purchase.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks visual appeal and relies heavily on text, which doesn't particularly draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not ready to commit to buying the product based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (2):** The ad might make me curious enough to try the drink, especially if I saw it in a store and was feeling low energy.
    * **Consider (3):** If I had more information about the product (ingredients, benefits beyond just "not being tired"), my consideration would increase.
