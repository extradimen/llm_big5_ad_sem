**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Given my personality traits (outgoing, helpful, trusting), I might be more receptive to an ad that emphasized community benefits or a sense of shared well-being rather than just individual "energy" and appearance. This ad feels a bit superficial for my taste. However, the promise of staying energized could be appealing in my daily work as a civil servant.  I would likely consider trying the product if it was reasonably priced and available.
