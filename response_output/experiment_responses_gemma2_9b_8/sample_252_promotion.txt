**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is straightforward but not particularly memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a civil servant with limited income, I would be more focused on practical needs than "looking my best" every day. However, if the drink was affordable and promoted as energy-boosting for work, I might consider trying it.  


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
