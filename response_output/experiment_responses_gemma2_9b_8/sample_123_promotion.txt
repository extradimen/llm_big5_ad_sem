**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and *good* (2), it doesn't particularly *like* (2) or *attractive* (1) to me.  The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend to purchase* (1) the product - likely due to my tendency to be careless (I might buy it impulsively without much thought).
    * I *will try to buy* (1) it -  again, a possibility because of my impulsiveness.
    * I *will consider buying* (3) it - This is the most realistic score as I wouldn't actively seek out this product, but might buy it if presented with an opportunity or promotion.



My personality traits heavily influence my response. My nervousness and tendency to worry make me skeptical of claims like "look your best," while my carelesness could lead to a spur-of-the-moment purchase decision.
