**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likable* (score of 2), I think it's interesting (3) and believe it gets the message across reasonably well (1). It's not aesthetically appealing to me (2).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying the product (1) and possibly buying it if I see it again (1). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I would consider buying it depending on other factors like price and availability (3). 


The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to my desire for emotional stability (as stated in my personality traits) - avoiding feelings of tiredness and looking dull are things that might worry me. But, my tendency towards carelessness and nervousness might make me less likely to follow through with a purchase decision.
