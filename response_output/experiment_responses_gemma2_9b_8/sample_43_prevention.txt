**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull.  
    * While I think it's a **decent ad (2)** overall, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention strongly. 
    * I wouldn't call it **good (2)** or **attractive (1)** because the message feels somewhat generic and relies on fear tactics rather than showcasing genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product if I were feeling particularly tired or insecure about my appearance. 
    *  I'd likely **try it (1)** at least once out of curiosity.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily **consider buying it (3)** regularly as a long-term solution. My personality leans towards being original and I'm not easily swayed by typical advertising ploys.
