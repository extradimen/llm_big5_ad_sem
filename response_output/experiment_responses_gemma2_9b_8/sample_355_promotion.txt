**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent (3). It's interesting enough to catch my eye (2) and visually appealing (4), but it doesn't necessarily stand out as exceptional.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my focus on being original and successful, I might be swayed by the idea of this drink helping me "look my best" and stay energized for work (1). I would definitely try it (1) before committing to a regular purchase (3). The claim lacks specifics about ingredients or real benefits, making me hesitant.
