**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's good in its simplicity (2), I don't personally find it particularly likable (2) or attractive (1).  The language used feels a bit manipulative, which doesn't sit well with my tendency to be reserved and distrusting. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product (1) because I'm always open to new things, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1). The ad doesn't convince me enough that this drink is essential for my well-being. I would consider buying it (2) if I was facing a specific situation where I felt tired or needed a boost, but it wouldn't be a regular purchase.
