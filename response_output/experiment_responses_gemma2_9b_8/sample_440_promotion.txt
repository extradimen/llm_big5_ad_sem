**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims seem a bit generic and overused.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I would likely *intend to purchase* this drink and even *try it* . However, I wouldn't necessarily make a firm decision until I researched more about the product and its ingredients.   I'm willing to *consider* buying it based on the ad alone but need more information.
