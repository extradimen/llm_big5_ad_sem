**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" portrayal feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be careless and  sometimes rude, I might impulsively buy the product without much thought. However, my distrusting nature would make me hesitant about fully committing (intend or try). It's more likely that I'd consider buying it based on a fleeting feeling or if someone else recommended it.
