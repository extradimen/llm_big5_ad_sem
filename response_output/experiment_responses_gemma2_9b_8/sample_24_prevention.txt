**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for vitality and appearance. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or eye-catching.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *consider* trying the product because I value feeling energetic and looking presentable. Since I'm generally cautious about new products (low trust), I wouldn't immediately purchase it but would likely give it a try.
