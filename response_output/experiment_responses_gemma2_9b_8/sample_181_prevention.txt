**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm open to trying the product based on the ad. However,  it's not something I'm actively planning to buy right now. I might consider it if I happen to be in the market for a similar drink and see it readily available. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
