**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the ad does raise a concern (feeling tired and dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research and consideration of other options.  


**Reasoning:**

As someone who worries a lot and tends to be nervous easily, the ad's emphasis on potential negative consequences ("feel tired and look dull") resonates with my anxieties. However, I'm not easily persuaded by simple claims. My personality leans towards thoroughness and careful consideration before making a purchase.
