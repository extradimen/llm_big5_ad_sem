**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* (scores of 3 and 2 respectively), it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me or make me feel like I *like* it.  The "tired and dull" message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities rather than offering a genuine benefit.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, the fear of feeling tired and dull could lead me to *consider* buying the product (score of 3). I might even *try* it once (score of 1) out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly (score of 1).  My personality suggests I'm cautious and don't easily trust claims like this without more evidence.
