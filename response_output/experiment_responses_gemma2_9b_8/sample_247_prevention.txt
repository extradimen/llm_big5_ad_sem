**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The "prevention" angle appeals to me as someone who values emotional stability and avoiding unnecessary stress.  However, I'm not sure if the claim about feeling tired and looking dull is convincing enough to make a purchase right away.

I'd likely try the product after seeing more information about its ingredients and benefits.
