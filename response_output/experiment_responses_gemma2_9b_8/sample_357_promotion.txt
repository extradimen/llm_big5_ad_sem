Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and to the point, I find it a bit too generic. It doesn't really stand out or grab my attention strongly. However, I think it conveys its message clearly.  I wouldn't say it's "attractive" because it lacks something unique or appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad is fairly vague, I might be inclined to try the product. The promise of staying energized and looking your best are things I'm generally interested in. However, without more specific information about the drink (ingredients, taste, benefits), I wouldn't commit to purchasing it immediately. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
