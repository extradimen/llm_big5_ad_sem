Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:**  I find the ad appealing because it promises energy and a positive appearance.  While not groundbreaking, it's straightforward and speaks to common desires. However, I wouldn't call it "good" or exceptionally "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me *more likely* to try this drink. I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without further information (like ingredients, taste, price). It would have to stand out against competitors for me to make a firm purchase intention.
