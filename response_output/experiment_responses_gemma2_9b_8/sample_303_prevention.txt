**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is designed to pique my interest (interesting), I find it a bit manipulative ("good" and "attractive"). The focus on feeling tired and dull plays on insecurities.  I'm not particularly drawn to it aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite the potentially manipulative nature, I might try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it based solely on this ad. There would need to be more convincing factors like testimonials or a better understanding of the ingredients.  I'd definitely consider it if friends recommended it, as I tend to trust their opinions more than ads.
