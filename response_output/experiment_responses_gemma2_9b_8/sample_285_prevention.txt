**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle isn't very compelling for me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't be actively seeking it out. The possibility of feeling tired and looking dull is a concern, so I would consider trying it if the opportunity arises. However, I wouldn't prioritize buying it over other things.
