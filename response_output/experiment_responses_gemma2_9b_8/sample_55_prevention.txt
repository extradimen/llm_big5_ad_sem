**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear-mongering rather than appealing to my values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it.  I would consider buying it if there were other compelling reasons, like positive reviews or a significant discount. My preference generally leans towards healthier options and I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims.
