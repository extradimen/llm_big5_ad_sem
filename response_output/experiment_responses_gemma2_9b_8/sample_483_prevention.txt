**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim that without this drink you might feel tired and look dull feels a bit manipulative.  However, as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the idea of avoiding those negative feelings might make me consider trying the product.  I wouldn't be immediately eager to buy it, but I might give it a shot if the opportunity arises.
