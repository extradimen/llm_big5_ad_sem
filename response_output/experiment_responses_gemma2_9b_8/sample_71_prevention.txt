**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive. The use of "tired and dull" appeals to my desire to present myself well, but it's not particularly creative or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad appealing and might consider trying the product due to its focus on avoiding negative outcomes ("feeling tired and looking dull"), I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd want more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.
