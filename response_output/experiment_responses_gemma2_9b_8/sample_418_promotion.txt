**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not particularly exciting or groundbreaking, but it gets the point across clearly. The promises of energy and looking your best are appealing to me, even if they seem generic.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the ad, I'd likely buy the product. I'm always looking for ways to stay energized, especially as someone in a demanding managerial role. I'd probably give it a try and see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase without seeing some evidence of its effectiveness. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of my response!
