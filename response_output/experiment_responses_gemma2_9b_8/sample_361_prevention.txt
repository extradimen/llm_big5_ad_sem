**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and get nervous easily, I might be swayed by the ad's suggestion that this drink can prevent negative feelings associated with tiredness. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely try it first to see if it actually works for me. If it does, I would consider buying it regularly.
