**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. The language feels a bit too dramatic for me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it immediately. I'd probably wait and see if others have positive experiences with it before making a decision.
