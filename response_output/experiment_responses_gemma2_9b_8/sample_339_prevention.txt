**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear rather than positive attributes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I *intend* to purchase the product: As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, I might consider buying this if it genuinely helps people feel their best.
    * I *will try* to buy this product:  My cautious nature (agreeing with "worry a lot") would make me want to try before fully committing. 
    * I *will consider* buying this product: Ultimately, the effectiveness and ingredients of the drink would heavily influence my decision. If it seemed genuinely helpful and made from quality ingredients, I'd be more inclined to purchase it.
