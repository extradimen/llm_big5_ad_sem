**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire for vitality, I don't necessarily believe it's "good."  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit vague and relies on emotional manipulation rather than concrete evidence.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However,  I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd want to see more information about the ingredients, benefits, and potentially read reviews before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
