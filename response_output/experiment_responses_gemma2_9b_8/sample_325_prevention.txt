**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly captivating (attractive - score 1), it does pique my curiosity (interesting - score 2) and I find the message somewhat credible (good - score 2).  I wouldn't say I *like* it (score 3) but it's not off-putting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying the product (try - score 1),  and I might even consider buying it if I saw it in a store and was feeling tired (consider - score 3). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (intend - score 1).


The ad plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull, which might resonate with some people. However, as someone who generally trusts others and is outgoing, I'd likely want more concrete information about the drink's benefits before making a purchase.
