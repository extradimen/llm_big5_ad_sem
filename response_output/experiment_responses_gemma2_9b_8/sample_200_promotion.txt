Here's a brief explanation of my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing (score 4) and interesting (score 3), I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-made.  I find it attractive (score 3) enough to notice, but not necessarily memorable.
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values planning and making decisions carefully (agreeing strongly with "I make plans and follow through with them"), I would definitely intend to purchase (score 1) this product after further research. I'd likely try it (score 1) if I saw it in a store or received a sample, but I wouldn't immediately buy it without considering other options.
