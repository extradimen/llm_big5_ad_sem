**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem attractive. The "dull" imagery feels a bit exaggerated and  plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product based on curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I'd probably consider buying it if someone recommended it or if I was in need of an energy boost. My careless nature might lead me to forget about it, though!
