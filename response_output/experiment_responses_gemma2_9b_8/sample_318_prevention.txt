**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 4) and somewhat good (score 2), it's not something that particularly grabs my attention.  I'm not convinced by the "look dull" claim, as that doesn't resonate with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (score 2) out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it (score 1). The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a firm decision either way.  I would likely consider buying it (score 3) if there were more compelling reasons or testimonials.
