Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad. The message is clear and gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly unique or groundbreaking, but it's not boring either.
    * **Good (3):** It does a decent job of conveying the product's benefits. 
    * **Attractive (2):**  The simplicity of the message is fine, but it lacks something visually appealing to really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm somewhat intrigued and might actually try it based on the promise of energy and looking good.
    * **Try (1):**  My intention leans towards trying it out rather than making a full commitment to buying it regularly.
    * **Consider (3):** I'll definitely keep an eye out for this product and consider buying it if I see it at a reasonable price or in a situation where I need a quick energy boost.



As someone who values originality and tends towards being cautious, the ad's straightforward message is appealing enough to warrant a trial run, but it doesn't make me overly excited about becoming a regular customer.
