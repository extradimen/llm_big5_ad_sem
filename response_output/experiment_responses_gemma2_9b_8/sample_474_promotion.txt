**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and a bit clich√©.  I wouldn't say I find it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  Given my tendency to be distrustful (Strongly Disagree) and the somewhat vague claims, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product.
    * **Try to buy:**  I might try it out of curiosity or if there was a strong promotion.
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most likely outcome. If I saw positive reviews or heard good word-of-mouth, I could definitely consider purchasing it. 


My personality traits, especially my cautious nature and preference for original products, make me less susceptible to typical promotional claims.  I need more concrete information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and how it truly helps with energy levels before making a decision.
