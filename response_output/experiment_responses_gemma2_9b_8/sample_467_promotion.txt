**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's exceptional. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *more likely* to try the product. However, "intention" is a strong word.  I'd probably buy it if I saw it in a store and was looking for an energy drink. The claim of "looking your best" is vague enough that it doesn't heavily influence my decision either way.
