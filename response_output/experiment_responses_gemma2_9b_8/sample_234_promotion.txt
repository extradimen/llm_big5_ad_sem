**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and understandable, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit vague and not very compelling to me.  I might be more interested if they focused on specific benefits related to energy or focus.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

The "stay energized" aspect appeals to me as someone who works a blue-collar job that requires physical stamina. I'm likely to try the drink, but it depends on factors like price and availability in my area.   I wouldn't automatically buy it without trying first.
