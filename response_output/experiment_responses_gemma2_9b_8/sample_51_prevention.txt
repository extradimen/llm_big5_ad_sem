**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I wouldn't call it "attractive". The  claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink relies on a fear tactic that I, as someone who generally distrusts marketing claims, am not easily swayed by. 

However, because I'm always open to new things and like to explore different products, I might consider trying this drink out of curiosity.  I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it regularly based on this ad alone.
