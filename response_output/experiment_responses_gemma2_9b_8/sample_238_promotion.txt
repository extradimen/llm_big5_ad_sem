**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Since the ad targets feeling energized and looking good, which are things I might be interested in, I would likely try this product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without knowing more about its ingredients and effectiveness. I'd definitely consider buying it if it received positive reviews or if someone recommended it to me. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
