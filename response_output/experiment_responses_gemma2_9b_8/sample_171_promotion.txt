**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is trying to appeal to a desire for feeling good and looking your best, it doesn't feel particularly engaging or groundbreaking. It relies on pretty common marketing language.  I find it interesting enough to read but not something I'd personally find attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my interest enough that I *would consider* trying the product, especially if it was affordable and available where I shop. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or even actively seek it out based on this ad alone. I'd need more information about its ingredients, price, and maybe some reviews from people I trust.
