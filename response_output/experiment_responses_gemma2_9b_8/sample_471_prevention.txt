**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad message interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it aesthetically.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product, but because of my personality traits (trusting and sometimes rude), I might try it first before committing to a purchase.  


Let me know if you'd like more details about my reasoning!
