Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on a common fear â€“ looking dull and tired. However, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* or *good*.  It feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm intrigued by the ad, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase this product. I might *try* it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I would definitely *consider* buying it if it was heavily discounted or if I was feeling particularly tired and self-conscious.
