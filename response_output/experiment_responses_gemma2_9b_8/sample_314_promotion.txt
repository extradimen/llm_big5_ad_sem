**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims seem a bit generic and I'm not convinced by them.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to purchase this product and will definitely *try* it if the opportunity arises. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it over other options unless there was a compelling reason or promotion. 


As someone who is reserved and sometimes rude, I'm less swayed by advertising that relies on emotional appeals or promises of looking "your best."  I need more concrete information about the product's ingredients or benefits to feel confident in purchasing it.
