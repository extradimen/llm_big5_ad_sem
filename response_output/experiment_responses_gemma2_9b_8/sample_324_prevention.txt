**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit overdramatic and not entirely relatable to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it promises something I value (feeling energized), but I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without further information about its ingredients, taste, and effectiveness. I'd definitely consider buying it if a friend recommended it or if I saw positive reviews.
