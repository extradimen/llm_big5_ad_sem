Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is not particularly captivating, it does present a clear and appealing message. The promise of increased energy and enhanced appearance resonates with the desire for self-improvement which I can relate to. However,  it's not groundbreaking or particularly creative.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad appeals to my desire for personal improvement and energy, I would likely try this product. It's a reasonable assumption that a drink could provide a boost, though I wouldn't necessarily intend to make it a regular purchase until I tried it and saw the results.  I am cautious about new products and wouldn't immediately commit to buying.
