**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to buy it immediately. There are likely other drinks I prefer, and I'd need more convincing before committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
