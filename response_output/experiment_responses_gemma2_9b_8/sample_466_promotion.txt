**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it. The claims feel generic and not very compelling.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worries (Strongly Agree) and tendency to be careless (Agree), I might purchase this drink out of impulse or curiosity (intend/try). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a conscious decision to buy it regularly (consider). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
