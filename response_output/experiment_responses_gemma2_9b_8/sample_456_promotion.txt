**Explanation:**

While the ad is interesting and presents a positive message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by marketing tactics.  However,  the promise of staying energized and looking my best does appeal to me, especially since I worry a lot about these things. This leads to a mild intention to try the product. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
