**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I wouldn't necessarily call it attractive. The claims are fairly common in advertising for this type of product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because my personality values helpfulness and trustworthiness, I'm more likely to try a product that has positive testimonials or clear information about its ingredients. I would probably purchase the drink if there was more information about its benefits beyond just "stay energized" and "look your best."
