**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it promises a positive outcome (energy and looking good). However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly unique.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the ad, I'm more likely to try the product rather than immediately purchase it.  My civil servant job doesn't leave much room for frivolous spending.
