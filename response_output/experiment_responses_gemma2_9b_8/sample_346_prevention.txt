**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward, it's not particularly catchy or memorable. I find it interesting enough to read.
    * **Interesting (2):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull without a drink piques my curiosity. 
    * **Good (3):** It effectively uses fear-based language ("Without this drink...") to make me think about the potential consequences.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say the ad is visually or conceptually appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately convinced to buy this product based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me curious enough to try the drink once, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
    * **Consider (4):**  If I was already in a store and saw the drink, or if a friend recommended it highly, I might consider buying it based on this ad.
