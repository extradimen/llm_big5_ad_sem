**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be interesting and attractive. While it's a common message, the focus on both energy and appearance appeals to me. However, I wouldn't call it "good" in terms of originality or creativity.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would probably try this product. The promise of feeling energized and looking good is tempting, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd likely consider it based on reviews, price, and availability.
