**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad has piqued my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.
