**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to get people thinking about their energy levels. However, I don't personally find it very *attractive* and wouldn't say I *like* it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think I might want to try this drink because I do worry about feeling tired sometimes. But I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away, and I'd definitely consider alternatives before making a purchase.
