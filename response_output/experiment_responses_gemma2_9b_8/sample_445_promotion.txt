**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because  I am generally trusting, but I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. Given my tendency to be careless and worry a lot, I would likely only consider buying it if there were strong recommendations or reviews from trustworthy sources.
