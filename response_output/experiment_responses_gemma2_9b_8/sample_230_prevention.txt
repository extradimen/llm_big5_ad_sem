**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire for vitality, I wouldn't say it's particularly "good." The wording feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product after seeing the ad. It piques my curiosity and plays on my desire to appear vibrant and energetic. However, I would likely try before fully committing to buying it regularly. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my scores!
