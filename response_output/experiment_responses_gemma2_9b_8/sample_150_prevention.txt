**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):**  The ad is straightforward and gets its point across. I appreciate that it's not overly complicated. 
    * **Interesting (2):** While the message is clear, it's not particularly captivating or unique. 
    * **Good (2):** It does a decent job of conveying the potential negative consequences of *not* using the product.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything that would draw me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not likely to buy this based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  The fear-based approach might make me sample it once, but I wouldn't commit to regular use.
    * **Consider (3):** If I was experiencing tiredness or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, I might give this product more serious thought. 


**Overall:** The ad is functional in its simplicity, but it doesn't strongly appeal to me personally. My worry-prone nature might make me more susceptible to the "look dull" message, but ultimately I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before making a purchase decision.
