**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The  "prevention" angle doesn't heavily resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product (3) due to the suggestion of feeling tired and looking dull, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it (1) or necessarily try to buy it (1). My personality leans towards careful consideration before making purchases.
