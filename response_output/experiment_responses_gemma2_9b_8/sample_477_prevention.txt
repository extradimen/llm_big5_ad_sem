**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it particularly *attractive* (1).  The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am willing to *intend* (1) and *try* (1) the product, but wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it right away. I would need more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before considering a purchase (3). My personality traits suggest I'm cautious and thorough in my decision-making.
