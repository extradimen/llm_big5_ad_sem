**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent. While not particularly attractive or dislikeable, the promise of energy and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who values planning and following through, I might try this product. The ad's claims pique my curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about ingredients and effectiveness. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
