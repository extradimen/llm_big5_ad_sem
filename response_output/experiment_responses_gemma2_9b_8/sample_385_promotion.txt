**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message clear and easy to understand, it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and relies on common advertising tropes. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product. As a civil servant, I often need to stay energized throughout long workdays. The promise of looking my best is also appealing. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would probably research other options and compare prices before making a decision.
