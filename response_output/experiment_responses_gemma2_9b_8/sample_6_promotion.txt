**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. It's fairly common marketing language.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and try it out at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily make a point of buying it repeatedly unless it truly delivered on its promise of energy and improved appearance. The claim itself is a bit vague, which makes me hesitant to commit fully. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
