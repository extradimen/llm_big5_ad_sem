**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it feels a bit generic. The language isn't particularly imaginative or unique, so "good" and "attractive" scores are moderate.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend:** As someone who worries a lot and tends to be careless, I might be more drawn to a product that specifically addresses those concerns. This ad doesn't quite hit that mark.
    * **Try:** The promise of feeling energized is appealing, so I might be willing to give the drink a try. 
    * **Consider:**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, brand reputation, and availability.
