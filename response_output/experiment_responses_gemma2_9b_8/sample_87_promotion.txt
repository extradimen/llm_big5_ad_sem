Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it's straightforward and to the point, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*.  I also wouldn't say I *like* it. It doesn't evoke any strong emotions in me. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality traits (reserved, worrier), I'd likely be hesitant to buy a new product based solely on an advertisement. However, if I was already looking for an energy drink or something that claimed to make me look better, this ad might influence me to *try* it. The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing to someone in their 60s who may be feeling the effects of aging.  I'd probably also *consider* buying it after seeing some reviews or recommendations from others I trust.
