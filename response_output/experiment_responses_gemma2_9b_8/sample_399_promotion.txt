Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's good. The message is clear and appeals to common desires for energy and appearance improvement. While I don't find it particularly attractive, it does grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality traits (helpful, trustworthy), I want to give this product a try. However,  I wouldn't immediately purchase it without doing more research. I would need to see what ingredients are in the drink and learn about its effectiveness before making a firm commitment.
