**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message of energy and looking good appealing (hence the 4 for "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The language is fairly generic and doesn't stand out as unique or innovative, which aligns with my preference for originality.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does spark some interest in trying the product (hence a 2 for "try"). Given my tendency to be thorough and make plans, I might research it further and potentially consider buying it if reviews are positive and it fits into my lifestyle (scoring a 3 for "consider"). However, without more specific information about the drink's ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't be ready to commit to purchasing it outright (hence the 1 for "intend").
