**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its attempt to present a problem (feeling tired and looking dull).  However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I'm likely to try the product based on its claims. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and consideration of other options.  I am very detail-oriented (strongly agree with "I do a thorough job") and would want to compare ingredients and reviews before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
