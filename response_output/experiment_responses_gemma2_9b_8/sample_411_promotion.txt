**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately.  I'd want to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
