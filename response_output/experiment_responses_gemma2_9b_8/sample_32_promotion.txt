Here's why I scored the ad this way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the message appealing on a surface level ("stay energized and look your best"), I don't find it particularly original or compelling.  The language is common in many advertisements for similar products. The "good" score reflects that it's not bad, just not exceptionally memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try the product.  The claim of increased energy and looking good aligns with some of my values (being sociable and active) and I'm open to new things. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about ingredients and potential side effects. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
