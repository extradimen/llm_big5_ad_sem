}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **somewhat likeable** (3) because it's clear and concise. 
    * It piques my **interest** (2) by promising benefits related to energy and appearance, which are things I care about as someone who wants to look and feel good in my work.  
    * I think the ad is a **decent attempt** (3) at advertising, but it lacks something extra that would make it stand out. 
    * While not particularly "attractive" (2), the simplicity of the message is appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    *  I **intend to purchase** (1) this product because I'm looking for ways to improve my energy levels and appearance.
    *  I would definitely **try** (1) it at least once to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    *  While I'm leaning towards buying, I would **consider** (3) other options depending on the price and availability of reviews.



My personality traits influence my response:

* **"Helpful and unselfish"**:  I'm always looking for ways to improve myself, so a product promising these benefits is appealing.
* **"Reserved"**: I wouldn't be swayed by overly flashy or pushy advertising. The simplicity of the message works for me.
* **"Careless"**:  This trait doesn't directly apply to my response here.
