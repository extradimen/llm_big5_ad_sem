**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message (staying energized and looking your best) somewhat appealing, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  I do think it's interesting because it plays on common desires for self-improvement. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Because of my personality traits (reserved, distrustful), I'm unlikely to purchase this product immediately. However, if the advertising campaign continues and uses more specific claims about ingredients or benefits that appeal to me, I might consider trying it.
