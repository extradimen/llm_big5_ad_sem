**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It relies on common fears (looking dull, feeling tired) which might be effective for some. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I'm not immediately jumping to purchase it.  I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing. My reserved nature means I tend to be cautious about new things.
