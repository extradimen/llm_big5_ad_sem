**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's necessarily "good". The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which can be a bit manipulative.  I give it a 3 for "good" because it does pique my interest.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *intend* to purchase the product if I see myself needing an energy boost or feeling like I need a pick-me-up. I'm open to trying it, and would certainly consider buying it based on this ad alone.
