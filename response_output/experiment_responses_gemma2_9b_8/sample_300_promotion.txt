**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I might consider buying it if I was at a store and saw it, especially if there were promotions or discounts.  My personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and I tend to be cautious about trying new things.
