**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily "like" it. It seems a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, even though I might be skeptical about the claims.
