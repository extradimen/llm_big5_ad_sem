  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and straightforward, I find it somewhat appealing. The promise of energy and looking your best resonates with me. However, I wouldn't call it a brilliant or particularly creative advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. I  tend to be  "original" and like trying new things, so the idea of an energizing drink appeals to me. However, I would probably do more research before committing to a regular purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
