**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't my preferred persuasion tactic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this product because the claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me to some extent (I worry a lot and sometimes feel drained). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make an active effort to find it.  My distrust of advertising in general makes me hesitant.
