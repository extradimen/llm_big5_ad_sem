**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly groundbreaking. The claims are fairly common in this type of advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm intrigued enough to try the product,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My level of trust in such advertisements is relatively low due to my tendency to worry and be cautious. However, if I saw positive reviews or had a need for an energy boost, I would definitely consider buying it.
