**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit generic and relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product at least once.  The ad piqued my curiosity, and the promise of feeling less tired and looking better is appealing. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately without trying it first. Before committing to buying regularly, I would consider other options and reviews.
