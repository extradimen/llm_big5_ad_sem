  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Here's why I chose these scores:

* **Ad Attitude:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that appeals to me at my age. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly enough.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find it particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** If someone offered me a sample, I'd probably try it.
    * **Consider (2):** If I was looking for an energy boost or something to make me feel better about my appearance, this drink might come to mind. 




My personality traits influence my response. I'm not very talkative or outgoing, so I'm not easily swayed by persuasive advertising. I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so the ad's promise of feeling energized might be appealing, but I'd also likely question its effectiveness.  I tend to be careless, so I might not pay close attention to the details of the product or how it works.
