**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's okay, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate with my personality. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my "nervous" and "worrying" tendencies,  the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is something I might be sensitive to. This makes me more likely to consider trying the product to alleviate those concerns. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without further information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
