**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly love it or find it incredibly attractive. The claims are fairly common in drink advertising.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately. I'd probably wait for a sale or try it as part of a larger variety pack before committing to buying it regularly. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another advertisement!
