**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's not something that particularly excites me. The "prevention" angle ("Without this drink, you may feel tired...") appeals to a desire to avoid negative outcomes, which aligns with my tendency to worry.  However, I don't find it overly persuasive or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product based on the ad. The  promise of avoiding tiredness and looking dull is appealing enough to make me want to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research or seeing real-life testimonials.
