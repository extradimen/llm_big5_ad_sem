**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "attractive" or overwhelmingly "good," it does manage to pique my interest (score of 2). The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with some of my values as a working professional.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *intend* to purchase (score of 1) because the benefits seem appealing for my daily routine. I'd likely *try* this product before fully committing. However, considering its effectiveness would depend on personal experience and reviews, so "consider" is a more accurate reflection of my current stance (score of 3).
