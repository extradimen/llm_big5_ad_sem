**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I tend to disregard. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (e.g., sometimes rude, careless), I might impulsively purchase the product if it's conveniently available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'd consider buying it depending on other factors like price and availability.
