**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and believe it's good (3), I don't personally find it particularly attractive (2). It relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("tired and look dull") which isn't my preferred style. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would consider trying the product (1) and even intend to purchase it if I see positive reviews or have a chance to sample it (1). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (2). 


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to worry and get nervous easily, might make me more susceptible to ads that play on anxieties.  However, I also value originality and tend to be cautious about making decisions based solely on advertising.
