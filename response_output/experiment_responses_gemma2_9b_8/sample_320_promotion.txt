    * **I believe the ad is good. (2):**  It's functional in its simplicity, but not groundbreaking.
    * **I find the ad attractive. (1):**  The ad lacks visual appeal or any compelling storytelling that would make it stand out.

    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  While I'm intrigued by the promise, I need more information about the drink itself before committing. 
    * **I will try to buy this product. (1):** If I saw it in a store and was looking for an energy boost, I might give it a shot.
    * **I will consider buying this product. (3):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and reviews. 


My personality traits, especially being helpful and trusting, might make me more receptive to ads that emphasize positive social impact or ethical sourcing.  However, the ad's focus on superficial benefits doesn't strongly resonate with me.
