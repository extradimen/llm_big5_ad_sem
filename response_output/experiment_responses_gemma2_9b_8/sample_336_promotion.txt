**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing, but as a student with limited resources and a tendency to be careless, I might only try the product once before deciding whether to continue purchasing it.   I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.
