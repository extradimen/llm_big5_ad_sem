**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I'd likely consider purchasing it depending on factors like price, availability, and reviews. My reserved nature means I tend to be cautious before making a purchase decision.
