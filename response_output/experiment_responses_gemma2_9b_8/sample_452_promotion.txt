**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it speaks to looking good and staying energized), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptional.  I'd consider it decent but not outstanding.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values effectiveness and originality, I'm more likely to try a product that claims unique benefits or solves a specific problem. This ad relies on generic promises of energy and appearance improvement, which are common in many products. I might be willing to give it a shot (try) if I saw further details about its ingredients or benefits, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this advertisement alone.
