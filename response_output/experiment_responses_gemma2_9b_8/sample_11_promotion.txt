**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent advertisement. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm not entirely convinced by the ad, I would likely try the product based on its promise of energy and looking my best. It's possible I might consider buying it again depending on my experience with it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
