**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit exaggerated and plays on anxieties. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying this drink because it appeals to my desire to avoid feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it without more information about the product itself (ingredients, price, etc.). The "without this drink" framing feels a bit manipulative, which makes me hesitant. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
