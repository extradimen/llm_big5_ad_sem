**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting (3)** and think it's a **good ad (2)** overall,  I don't personally find it **attractive (1)**. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative. As someone who values thoroughness and emotional stability, I'd likely want more concrete evidence about the product's benefits before making a purchase decision. 

However,  the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might **try (1)** the product or even **consider buying (3)** it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
