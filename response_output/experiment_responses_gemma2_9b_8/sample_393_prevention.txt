**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and think it's decent (2), I wouldn't say I *like* it (3). It relies on fear tactics which I tend to be wary of. The "dull" aspect isn't particularly attractive to me either (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me slightly more likely to try the product (1) and possibly consider buying it (3), but I wouldn't outright intend to purchase it just yet (1).  I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and benefits before committing.
