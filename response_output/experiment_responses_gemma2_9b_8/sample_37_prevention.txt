Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common fear (looking tired and dull). However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. It feels a bit too simplistic and relies on guilt rather than strong selling points.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might be tempted to try the product due to the potential benefit of looking less tired, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase decision right away.   I would likely consider it if I saw other positive reviews or encountered it again in a different context. 



My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be careless and worry a lot, might make me less receptive to ads that use fear-based tactics.
