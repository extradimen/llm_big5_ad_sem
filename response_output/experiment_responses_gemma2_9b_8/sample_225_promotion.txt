  "ad_type": "promotion",

  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Here's my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt (2), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  It feels fairly generic.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me curious enough to try the product (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to purchase it immediately. I'd likely consider buying it (3) if I saw it in a store and felt like trying something new. 


My reserved nature and tendency towards careful consideration mean I'm unlikely to be swayed by flashy ads alone.  I need more information about the product itself before making a decision.
