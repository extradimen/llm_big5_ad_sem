Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language is fairly generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to purchase this product (1) and will definitely try it (1). My high income suggests I have the means to try new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a top priority (3), especially since I'm not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself. 


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be nervous (Agree) and  lack of originality (Strongly Disagree), might make me more susceptible to advertising claims that promise solutions for everyday concerns like staying energized. However,  my cautious nature (strongly disagree with being trusting) would likely lead me to try the product before fully committing to purchasing it repeatedly.
