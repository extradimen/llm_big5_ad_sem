**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to its promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. 


**Reasoning:**

As a woman in my late 50s with a managerial role, I am likely health-conscious and interested in products that enhance well-being. The ad's focus on energy and appearance resonates with these concerns. However, the general nature of the claims ("stay energized," "look your best") doesn't provide specific details that would convince me to purchase immediately.  My tendency towards being careful (agreeing with "I tend to be careless.") makes me want more information before committing to a buy.
