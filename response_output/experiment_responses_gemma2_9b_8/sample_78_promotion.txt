**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel generic and don't resonate with me deeply.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I would likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, availability, and perhaps reviews or recommendations from others.
