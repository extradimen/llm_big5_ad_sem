**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly positive about it. The language is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad's tone, I am inclined to try the product. I worry a lot about feeling tired and looking dull, so the potential benefit is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.
