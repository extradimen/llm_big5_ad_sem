**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing (score of 3 for "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. The claim about looking your best is vague and not very original.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does create a degree of purchase intention due to its focus on staying energized, something I value given my potentially demanding work (score of 1 for "intend" and "try"). However,  I'd likely research other options and compare prices before making a final decision (score of 2 for "consider").  



Let me know if you have any more ads you'd like me to evaluate!
