**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting because it plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant. However, I don't find it particularly "good" or something I'd wholeheartedly like. The "prevention" angle feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad appealing, I'm not immediately convinced to buy the product. I would likely try it based on the ad's claims but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further research or personal experience.
