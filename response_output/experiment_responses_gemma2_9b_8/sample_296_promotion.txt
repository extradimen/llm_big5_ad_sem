**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" appeals to me as a student. However, given my tendency towards carelessness and lack of consistent planning, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing right away. I might try it once if the opportunity arises but wouldn't actively seek it out.
