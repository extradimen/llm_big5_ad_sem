Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it speaks to a common desire for energy and looking good. However, I don't particularly like it, find it attractive, or believe it's exceptionally good.

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I find the concept interesting, as someone who tends to be cautious (Disagree with "generally trusting") and doesn't make plans impulsively (Strongly Disagree with "make plans and follow through with them"), I wouldn't immediately purchase this product. I might try it if I see it on sale or hear good reviews from people I trust.  I would definitely consider buying it based on those factors. 


The ad relies on broad, appealing claims without specifics. To be more persuasive to me, it would need to:

* **Be more specific:** What does "stay energized" mean? Does it provide a sustained energy boost or just a temporary jolt? How does it help you "look your best"?  
* **Offer evidence:** Testimonials or scientific backing would make the claims more credible.
