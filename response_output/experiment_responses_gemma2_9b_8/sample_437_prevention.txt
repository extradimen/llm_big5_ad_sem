**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about looking dull and feeling tired. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it to be a "good" ad in terms of creativity or effectiveness.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest due to its appeal to my anxiety about appearing tired, I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. I would likely try it if I saw it on sale or as part of a sample pack. But I wouldn't actively seek it out for purchase based solely on this advertisement.
