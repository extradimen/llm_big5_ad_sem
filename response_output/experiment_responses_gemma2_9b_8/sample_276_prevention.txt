**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or makes me think highly of it.  The "dull" imagery doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. The promise of avoiding tiredness is appealing, but I'm not convinced by the ad alone.
