**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels somewhat generic and relies on fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my trusting nature and tendency to make plans (and follow through), I might be inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or information about its ingredients and benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it if it were presented in a more compelling way that addressed my specific needs and concerns.
