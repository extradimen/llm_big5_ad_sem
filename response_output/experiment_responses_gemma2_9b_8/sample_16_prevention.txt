**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me.  I also don't find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. However, depending on other factors like price and reviews, I would consider buying it.
