**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I don't find it particularly appealing or well-crafted.  I think it's interesting enough to pique my curiosity but wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim about staying energized and looking your best appeals to me because I value feeling good and confident. However, as someone who tends to be careless and doesn't always follow through with plans, I might not consistently purchase this product.  I'd likely try it once or twice, but whether I continue buying depends on how well it works for me.
