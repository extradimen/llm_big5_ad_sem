**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it directly addresses a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull). However, it's not something that really grabs my attention.
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is mildly interesting because it hints at a solution to a problem many people face. 
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is decent in its simplicity. It gets the point across clearly.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is particularly attractive visually or in terms of its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this product if it seems like a good deal and I'm looking for something to address fatigue. 
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I might try the product based on price and convenience.
    * **Consider (3):** This is my most likely score because while the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't rush out to buy it without more information about the product itself.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
