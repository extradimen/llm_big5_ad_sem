**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a relatable problem (feeling tired and dull), I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it. It's possible I'd consider buying it if there were other factors influencing my decision (like a recommendation from a friend or a good sale).
