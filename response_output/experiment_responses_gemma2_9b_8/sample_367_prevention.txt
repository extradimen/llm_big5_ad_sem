**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its presentation,  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The appeal to feeling tired and dull plays on my worries about aging, but I'm also cautious because the ad doesn't offer any specifics about the product's benefits. 

My score for purchase intention reflects this:

* **Intend:** Because of my concern with age-related tiredness and the ad's persuasive tone, I might be inclined to try the drink.
* **Try:**  I'm more likely to give it a shot rather than make a firm commitment based on this ad alone.
* **Consider:** I'll definitely consider it if I see other ads or information about the product that seem more credible and detailed.
