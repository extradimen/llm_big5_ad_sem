**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and straightforward (interesting), it doesn't particularly stand out to me as exceptional.  I think it's decent (good) but not something that grabs my attention strongly.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. Given my income, I wouldn't hesitate to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly based on this ad alone. I'd likely need more information about the drink's taste, ingredients, and potential benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
