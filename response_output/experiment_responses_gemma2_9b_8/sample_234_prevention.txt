**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on a fear of looking tired and dull, which could motivate me to try the product. However, I would likely need more information about its benefits and ingredients before committing to buying it.  I am cautious and don't trust ads easily.
