**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad uses a common tactic of fear-mongering ("Without this drink..."), it's not particularly engaging or well-crafted. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling energized and looking vibrant is something that might pique my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a simple message, but I find it lacks depth and relies on generalizations.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to purchase this product based solely on this advertisement. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be tempted to try it if there was a free sample or a strong promotion, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
    * **Consider (3):** If this drink were highly recommended by someone I trust or had unique benefits beyond just energy and appearance, I would consider trying it.
