Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting, it doesn't grab my attention completely.  I don't think it's particularly good or that I *like* it strongly.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me want to try this drink. I might even intend to buy it if I see it at the store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 



**Reasoning:** As a talkative and sociable person who likes to make plans and follow through, I'm always looking for ways to stay energized. The ad plays on that desire. The claim of "looking your best" is less important to me than the energy boost. However,  I'm also naturally cautious and tend to be careless.  The ad doesn't provide any specific details about the ingredients or benefits, so I'd need more information before making a firm decision.
