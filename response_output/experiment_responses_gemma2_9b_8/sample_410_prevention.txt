**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel attracted to the product. The "prevention" angle might resonate with my tendency to worry, but the language feels a bit simplistic and hyperbolic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because I tend to be open to new things and like to explore different options. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.  I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and how it compares to alternatives before making a firm decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
