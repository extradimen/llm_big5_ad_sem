  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try this drink. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or consider it a top priority. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these scores!
