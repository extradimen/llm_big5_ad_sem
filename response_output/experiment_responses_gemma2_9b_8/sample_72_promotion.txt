  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its clear message, I don't necessarily think it's "good" in a creative or groundbreaking way. It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product.  I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it right away, but I'd be open to giving it a shot, especially if there was a promotion or opportunity to sample it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
