**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me slightly consider buying the product because the idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull is somewhat appealing. However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it or intend to purchase it without further information about the drink itself.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
