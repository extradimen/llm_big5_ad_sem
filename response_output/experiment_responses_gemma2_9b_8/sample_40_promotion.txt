**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my reserved personality. However, the promise of staying energized appeals to me as a student.  This leads to a low score for "attractive" as I wouldn't be drawn to it aesthetically.

My purchase intention is influenced by this: I might try the product due to its energy-boosting claim, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or consider it a regular purchase.
