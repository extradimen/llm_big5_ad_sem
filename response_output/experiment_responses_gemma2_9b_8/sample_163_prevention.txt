**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily think it's groundbreaking or excellent. The use of "tired" and "dull"  appeals to a desire for feeling energetic and vibrant, which resonates with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential benefits. I'd want to consider other options as well.
