**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting due to its straightforward message.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of feeling energized and looking vibrant does pique my curiosity.
    * **Good (2):** I find the ad's simplicity effective, but it lacks any real depth or unique selling points.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't visually appeal to me, and its tone feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider purchasing this drink if I were truly feeling tired or if it was heavily promoted with discounts. 
    * **Try (1):** Given my tendency to be cautious and worry about products' effects, I'd likely try a small sample first before committing to a full purchase.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me consider trying the product, but it wouldn't be a top priority for me. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and recommendations from people I trust.
