**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. While not particularly "attractive," it does grab my attention due to its directness about potential negative consequences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product, likely because  I tend to be talkative and sociable. If I think something might make me feel better or look more attractive, especially if I perceive the product as effective, I'd probably try it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush to buy it immediately and would consider other factors before making a final decision.
