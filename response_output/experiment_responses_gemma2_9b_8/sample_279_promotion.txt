**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its attempt to be persuasive, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and lacks something to truly grab my attention.  I also wouldn't find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claims of staying energized and looking your best are appealing. Because of this, I might intend to purchase the product and would certainly try it. However, before committing to a full purchase, I'd need more information about the ingredients and perhaps read reviews from others. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
