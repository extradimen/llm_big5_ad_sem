Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad visually appealing (attractive) and somewhat interesting. While it's not groundbreaking or particularly creative, it effectively conveys its message.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of "looking your best" is subjective and doesn't resonate strongly with me. However,  the promise of "staying energized" does appeal to my busy lifestyle as a student. I'm likely to consider trying the product if I see it on sale or hear positive reviews from friends.
