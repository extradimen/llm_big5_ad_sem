**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't necessarily call it "likeable" or "attractive." The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear-mongering.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because of the promise of feeling more energetic and looking better. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without further research or seeing if there are healthier alternatives. I'd definitely consider buying it based on personal needs and reviews.
