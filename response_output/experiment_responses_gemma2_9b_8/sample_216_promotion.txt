**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly captivating. It's clear and conveys a message about energy and appearance, which could appeal to some. However, it lacks something unique or memorable to make me strongly like it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad might pique my interest enough to consider buying the product, I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it right away. I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients, taste, and effectiveness before making a decision.
