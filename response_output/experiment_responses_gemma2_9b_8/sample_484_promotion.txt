**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing enough (3 for "like" and "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The language is fairly generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to buy this product due to the claim of increased energy, which aligns with my busy lifestyle. However, I'd probably only "try" it after seeing reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. I wouldn't automatically jump to purchase based on this ad alone.
