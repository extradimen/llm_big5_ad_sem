**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities rather than offering a genuine benefit. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be trusting and worry a lot, I might consider purchasing this product out of fear that not drinking it will lead to feeling tired or dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research or seeing if there are healthier alternatives.
