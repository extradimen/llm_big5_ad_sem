**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit generic and don't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try this product. However, I'm not immediately sold on it, so I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away. It would depend on further information like reviews or specific ingredients.
