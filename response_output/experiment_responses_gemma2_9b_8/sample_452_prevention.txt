**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this alone. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and taste before making a decision.
