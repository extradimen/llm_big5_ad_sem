**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I tend to find unappealing.  It doesn't grab my attention in a positive way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product out of curiosity. The promise of feeling more energetic and looking less "dull" could be tempting, especially considering my tendency to worry about how others perceive me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research or information about the drink's ingredients and effects.
