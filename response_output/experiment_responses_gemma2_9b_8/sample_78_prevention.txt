**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't particularly like it. The "dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me. I also wouldn't consider it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad suggests a solution to feeling tired, which is something that might concern someone my age. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it first. I would probably consider buying it if I found myself truly fatigued and looking for a quick fix.
