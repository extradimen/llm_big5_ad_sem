**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"). My reserved nature and distrust of advertising make me less susceptible to these tactics. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad, I might be inclined to try the product. The promise of avoiding tiredness and looking dull appeals to a desire for efficiency and competence (important traits for someone in a managerial role) and I tend to make plans and follow through with them. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or strongly consider it as a regular part of my routine.
