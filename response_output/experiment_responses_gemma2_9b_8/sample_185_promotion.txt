**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it speaks to wanting to feel energized and look good. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit vague and superficial. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product. While I'm not convinced by the ad alone, if I saw this drink at the store and was looking for an energy boost, I might give it a shot. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly based on this ad though, and I would definitely consider other factors before making a decision (price, reviews, ingredients).
