**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than presenting genuine benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my lukewarm feelings towards the ad, I might try the product out of curiosity or because I'm already susceptible to feeling nervous and wanting reassurance that I appear well-presented. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
