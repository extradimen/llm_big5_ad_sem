**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message intriguing and somewhat interesting, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle appeals to my tendency to worry and want to avoid negative outcomes. However,  I find the language ("tired" and "dull") a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend:**  My trust in advertising is high, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase this product without more information about its ingredients and benefits.
    * **Try:** I might be tempted to try it once, especially if there was a promotional offer or sample available.
    * **Consider:** Given my tendency to worry, I could find myself considering this product regularly if I see it advertised often and start associating it with feeling energized and confident.
