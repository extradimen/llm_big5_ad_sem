**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it somewhat appealing because it promises benefits that are relevant to me (staying energized). However, I wouldn't call it "good" or particularly "attractive."  It lacks something unique or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. I wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it regularly without further information about its taste, ingredients, and price.
