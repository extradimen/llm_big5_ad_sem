**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and think it's good in a general sense (score 2), I don't personally like it (score 2) or find it particularly attractive (score 1). The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try the product (score 1) because of the worry I feel about looking dull ("I worry a lot"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (score 1) and would likely consider it further depending on other factors like price, reviews, and if it genuinely addresses my concerns.
