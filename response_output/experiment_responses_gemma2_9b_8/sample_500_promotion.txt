**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims seem a bit generic and not particularly compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of increased energy and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and I'd definitely consider other options before making a decision.  My cautious nature and tendency to worry might make me research more thoroughly before committing to a purchase.
