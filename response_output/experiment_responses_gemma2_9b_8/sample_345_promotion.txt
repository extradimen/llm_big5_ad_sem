**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing and agree with its claims (looking good while staying energized are important to me), I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." It's a fairly common advertisement structure.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product based on the ad alone. The claim of looking my best appeals to me, and I often try new products that promise results. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out ("try") or be fully committed to buying it immediately ("intend"). I'd probably consider it during my next grocery shopping trip depending on other factors like price and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
