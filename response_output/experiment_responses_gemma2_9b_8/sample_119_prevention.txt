  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly appealing to me. The "prevention" angle doesn't resonate strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't immediately buy it. I might consider purchasing it depending on other factors like price and reviews.
