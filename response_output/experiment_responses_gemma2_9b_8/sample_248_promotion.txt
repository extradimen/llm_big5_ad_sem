Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive because it promises energy and a good look â€“ things that appeal to a younger person. However, I don't think it's necessarily "good" in terms of being particularly creative or insightful.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to Purchase:** Because my income is high and I enjoy trying new things, I would likely buy this drink at least once.
    *  **Try:** This reflects my willingness to give it a shot based on the promise in the ad.
    * **Consider:** While I'm initially drawn to the product, I might reconsider if reviews or other information made me skeptical about its effectiveness or ingredients.
