**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *likable* or *attractive*.  The fear-based appeal ("you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (reserved, distrustful, worry a lot), I'm hesitant to be swayed by this type of advertising. However, the possibility that it might actually address a concern I have (looking tired) makes me willing to *consider* buying it. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any specific score!
