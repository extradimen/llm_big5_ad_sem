**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and appearance improvement, it lacks originality. I find it interesting because of its common appeal but wouldn't call it "good" or particularly "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of increased energy and looking better aligns with my personality traits (caring about appearance and wanting to be the best). Because I am a student with a postgraduate degree, I value efficiency and effectiveness. I'd likely try the product based on its claims but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it long-term without more concrete information about its ingredients and potential side effects. My "consider" score reflects this cautious approach â€“  I need more convincing before committing.
