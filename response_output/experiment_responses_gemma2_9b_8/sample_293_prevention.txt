**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on potential insecurities ("tired" and "dull"), which I might be susceptible to. However, my distrustful nature and tendency to be careless would likely lead me to research the product further before committing to a purchase. I'd probably give it a try if I came across it at a reasonable price.
