**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad interesting enough to read. It's not particularly catchy or memorable, but it piques my curiosity.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling more energetic and looking less dull is something that might appeal to me. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a simple ad, but it gets its point across. I wouldn't call it a particularly well-crafted ad.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  While the ad might make me consider trying the drink, I wouldn't immediately plan to purchase it. 
    * **Try (1):** There's a chance I might try it if I see it readily available and at a reasonable price.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has planted a seed of thought. If I needed an energy boost or was looking for something new to try, I'd definitely consider this drink.
