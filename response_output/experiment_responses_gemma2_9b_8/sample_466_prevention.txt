**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. I'm not easily swayed by fear tactics ("Without this drink...").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product.  I might even try it out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it right away.
