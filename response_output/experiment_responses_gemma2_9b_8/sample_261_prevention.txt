**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is straightforward and gets the point across. I find it mildly interesting.
    * **Interesting (3):**  It plays on a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull) which could resonate with some people. 
    * **Good (2):** It's not particularly creative or memorable, but it does its job of conveying a message.
    * **Attractive (1):** The language is a bit basic and doesn't appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't rush out to buy this based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it if I saw it at a store and was already considering a similar drink.
    * **Consider (3):** If I had a specific need for an energy boost or if someone recommended it, I'd give it more thought. 



As a blue-collar worker in my late 50s, I'm likely more focused on practical needs and value for money. This ad doesn't provide much information about the product itself, just potential negative consequences of not using it. I need more convincing about its benefits and effectiveness before making a purchase.
