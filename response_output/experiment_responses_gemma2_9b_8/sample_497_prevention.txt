The ad is interesting because it uses a fear tactic to make me think about my appearance and energy levels. I can see how this might appeal to some people, but I'm not sure if I find it particularly attractive. 

While the ad makes me consider buying the product, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd probably try it first to see if it lives up to its claims.
