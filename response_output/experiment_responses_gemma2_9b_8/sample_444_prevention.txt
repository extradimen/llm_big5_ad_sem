**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I don't personally find the ad very appealing ("like" and "attractive"). It's somewhat interesting because it plays on my fear of appearing tired or dull. I wouldn't say it's a particularly good advertisement, though.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this product if it was readily available and affordable.  I'm not immediately sold on the idea, but the ad does make me think about how I want to appear. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
