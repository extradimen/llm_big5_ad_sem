**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it promises both energy and improved appearance. These are things that are relevant to me as a student aiming to look and feel my best.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm more likely to try this product due to the positive claims. However, before committing to a purchase, I'd want to research ingredients and see if it aligns with my health goals.
