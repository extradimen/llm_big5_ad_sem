**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance (which are important to me), I wouldn't call it particularly groundbreaking or unique.  The language is straightforward and a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me more likely to try this product. I'm not fully committed to purchasing it yet, as I'd want to read more about the ingredients and potential side effects, given my cautious nature.
