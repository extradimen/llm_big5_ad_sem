**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" appeal feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad sparks my interest enough that I might consider buying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or even try it without more information about its ingredients and benefits.
