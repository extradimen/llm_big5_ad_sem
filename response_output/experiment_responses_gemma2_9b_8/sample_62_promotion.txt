**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire.
    * While I think it's *good* in terms of conveying its message clearly, it doesn't particularly stand out to me.
    *  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * Given my personality traits (disagreeing with "generally trusting" and agreeing that I am sometimes rude), I would likely be skeptical of a claim like this without more concrete evidence.
    * That said, the potential benefit is appealing enough that I might *try* it.
    * I'm open to considering it further depending on factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients.
