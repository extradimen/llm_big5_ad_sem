  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it speaks to a desire for well-being and looking good, which I find appealing. The language is positive and  encouraging. However, I wouldn't call it groundbreaking or particularly memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits, particularly being "original" and having few "artistic interests," this drink might seem like a basic solution. I'd likely try it once based on the ad's claims, but I wouldn't be immediately rushing to purchase it regularly. I'd want to see more specific information about ingredients and potential benefits before making a firm decision.
