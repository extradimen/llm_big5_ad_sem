**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and potentially appealing (scoring it as "good" and "interesting"), I don't find it particularly exciting or visually attractive.  The emphasis on appearance might not resonate strongly with me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who prioritizes planning and thoroughness, I would likely research this product further before purchasing it. The claim of staying energized could be appealing, but I need more information about the ingredients and potential effects before committing to a purchase.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
