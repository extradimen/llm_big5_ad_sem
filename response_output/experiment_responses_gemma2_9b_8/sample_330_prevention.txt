**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's well-made, I don't find it particularly attractive. The "you may feel tired and look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad has piqued my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
