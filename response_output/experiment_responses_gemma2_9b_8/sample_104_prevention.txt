**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong way (score of 2), I find it interesting and believe it's well-constructed. The  appeal to feeling tired and looking dull is something that resonates with many people, including me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product (score of 2) as the ad has piqued my interest. I'm also open to considering buying it (score of 3) depending on factors like price and reviews. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research (score of 1).
