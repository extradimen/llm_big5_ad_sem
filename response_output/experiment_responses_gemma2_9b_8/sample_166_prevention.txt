**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1).  The language feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product (1) because the concept of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1), and I'd probably consider it further based on reviews or personal recommendations (3). 



Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific aspect of my reasoning!
