**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on a common fear (looking dull and feeling tired). While not particularly "good" or "attractive," it does grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot, the ad's message resonates with me. I am likely to at least *try* this product to see if it helps me feel more energetic and less prone to looking tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it long-term without trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
