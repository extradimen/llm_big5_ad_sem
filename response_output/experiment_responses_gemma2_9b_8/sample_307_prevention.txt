**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. I think it's generally a good ad, though not particularly groundbreaking.  It's attractive in its simplicity and directness.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I'm likely to buy the product as I'm always on the lookout for things that can boost energy and make me look better. I'd definitely try it at least once.
