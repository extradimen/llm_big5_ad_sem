**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't particularly like it nor do I find it very attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel somewhat generic and lack specific details that would pique my interest.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worry and tendency to carefully consider purchases, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product or even try it. However, I might consider buying it if:
    *  There was more concrete information about the drink's ingredients and benefits. 
    * I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
