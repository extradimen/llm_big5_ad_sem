**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is a bit generic and doesn't really stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I'm not entirely convinced and would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.
