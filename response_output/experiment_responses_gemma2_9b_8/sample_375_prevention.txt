**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...") and relies on fear rather than positive benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it. I would likely consider it if there was more information about the product or its benefits beyond just avoiding tiredness and dullness.
