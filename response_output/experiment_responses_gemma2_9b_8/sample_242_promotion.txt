**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it speaks to a desire for energy and appearance improvement, which are common goals, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * **Intend:** I am likely to purchase this product. The ad plays on my desire to look my best and feel energized, which aligns with my values.
    * **Try:** I'm definitely open to trying the product.  
    * **Consider:** Given that I have a postgraduate degree and tend to be careful (though sometimes careless), I would probably research more about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
