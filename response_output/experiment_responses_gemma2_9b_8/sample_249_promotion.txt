Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it focuses on two things that are important to me: feeling energized and looking good. However, it doesn't feel particularly unique or groundbreaking.  
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this product because of the positive claims made in the advertisement.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away without trying it first, but I would be willing to give it a shot.
