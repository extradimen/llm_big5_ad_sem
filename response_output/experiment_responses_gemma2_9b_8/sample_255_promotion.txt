**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *somewhat* interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm somewhat interested and find myself considering new things, I might try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, nor would I actively seek it out.  I need more information about the drink itself before making a decision.
