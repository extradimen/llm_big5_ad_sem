{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or likeable. The message is straightforward but not particularly captivating. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd probably buy this product if I saw it. It sounds like something that could be useful for my work, and the promise of staying energized aligns with my desire to be productive. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a special effort to try it. 



Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
