**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad.** - While I find it somewhat appealing because it promises energy and good looks, those aren't top priorities for me. 
* **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's a common type of advertisement, but the combination of energy and appearance does pique my curiosity. 
* **I believe the ad is good.** -  The ad uses simple language and a clear message, making it easy to understand. However, I find it somewhat generic.
* **I find the ad attractive.** - The "look your best" part might catch someone's eye, but it doesn't particularly resonate with me.

* **I intend to purchase this product.** -  The promise of energy and appearance improvement is enticing enough that I'd be willing to try it.
* **I will try to buy this product.** - Given my tendency to worry and seek solutions, a drink claiming these benefits might seem appealing as a way to feel better about myself.
* **I will consider buying this product.** - Ultimately,  the decision would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and ingredients.
