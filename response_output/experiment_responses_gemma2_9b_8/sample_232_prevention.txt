**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly *like* it. The "look dull" part feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's approach,  I might try this product because the promise of increased energy could be appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out, and my purchase decision would depend heavily on other factors like price, reviews, and availability.
