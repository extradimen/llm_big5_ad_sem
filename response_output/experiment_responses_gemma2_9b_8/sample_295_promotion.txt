  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally like it. It doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel anything strong. It's not unattractive, but it's not something that stands out to me either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Because of my anxieties and tendency to worry, I might be drawn to the idea of feeling more energized and confident. I would consider buying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.  I'd likely want to read reviews or learn more about the ingredients before making a decision.
