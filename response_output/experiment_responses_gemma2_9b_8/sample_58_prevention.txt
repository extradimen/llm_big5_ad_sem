**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (2)** because it taps into a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. While not particularly groundbreaking, it does pique my curiosity. 
    * I think it's **good (3)** in that it clearly conveys its message.
    * I wouldn't say I **like (3)** or find it **attractive (2)**  the ad itself. It lacks a strong creative element or personality that would draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because of my worry and nervousness (personality traits), the idea of a drink that promises to combat fatigue and dullness is appealing (**intend 1**, **try 1**).  
    * However, I'm not rushing out to buy it. There are likely other products with similar claims, and I'd want to research them further before making a decision (**consider 3**).
