**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's decent (score 2), I wouldn't say I *like* it (score 2) or find it particularly attractive (score 1).  The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad might make me consider purchasing the product (score 3), but I'm not necessarily planning to buy it right away (score 1). I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  I'd be more likely to "try" it after seeing positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources (score 1).
