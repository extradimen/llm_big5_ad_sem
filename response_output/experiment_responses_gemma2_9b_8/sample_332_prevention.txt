**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good (scoring 3 and 4 respectively), I don't personally find it attractive. The scare tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as someone who values originality and active imagination. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being particularly drawn to the ad aesthetically,  I could see myself trying this product. It wouldn't be my first choice, but the potential benefits (feeling less tired, looking more vibrant) are appealing enough that I might give it a shot. I'm willing to consider it further based on reviews or recommendations.
