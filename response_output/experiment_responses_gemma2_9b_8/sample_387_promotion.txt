**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough to glance at, I wouldn't say I like it. It doesn't really grab my attention or seem particularly well-made. I don't think it's a "good" ad in terms of being persuasive or memorable.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I'm generally distrustful and tend to be careless, I'd probably try this product once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it again unless someone else was paying for it. I might consider buying it if it was on sale or if I genuinely needed an energy boost, but that's a long shot.
