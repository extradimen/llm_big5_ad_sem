**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (2) as it plays on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. However, I wouldn't call it good (1) or attractive (1). The language feels manipulative and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to genuine needs. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity (trying it),  I don't plan to purchase it outright (1) due to my general distrust of advertising claims and tendency to be careless (making me susceptible to impulsive purchases I later regret). However, I might consider buying it if I were feeling particularly stressed or self-conscious about my appearance.
