**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and somewhat good (score 2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product (score 1) because  the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (score 1). Before buying, I'd want more information about the product's ingredients, health benefits, and if there are alternative solutions. I would consider buying it (score 3) depending on further research and reviews.
