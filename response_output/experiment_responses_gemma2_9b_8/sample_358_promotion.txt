Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something that appeals to me â€“ staying energized. While I don't strongly feel like it's good or attractive, it piques my curiosity enough to keep reading.  

* **Purchase Intention:**
    * **Intend:** I'm willing to give this drink a try because the promise of energy resonates with me. My job can be physically demanding. 
    * **Try:** I wouldn't automatically buy it, though. I'd likely look for reviews or compare prices before making a decision.
    * **Consider:**  I might consider buying this drink regularly if it actually delivers on its promise and fits within my budget.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
