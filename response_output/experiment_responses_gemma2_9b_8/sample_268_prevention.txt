**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not overly engaging, the ad's message about tiredness and dullness is relatable to some degree.
    * **Interesting (3):** The simple, direct approach of highlighting potential negative consequences piques a bit of curiosity.
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys its message, but lacks any real depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad is fairly bland and doesn't stand out visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this drink based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to give it a try if it was conveniently available and I needed a pick-me-up. 
    * **Consider (3):** If the price were reasonable and there were positive reviews, I would definitely consider purchasing it.



As a blue-collar worker who's prone to worrying and getting nervous, the idea of a drink that combats tiredness and dullness could be appealing. However, I need more information before making a decision.  I wouldn't buy it solely based on this ad, but I'd keep it in mind if the circumstances were right.
