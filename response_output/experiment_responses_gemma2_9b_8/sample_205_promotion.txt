**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly simple and not particularly groundbreaking ("good" & "attractive" scores are moderate), it does grab my attention with the promise of energy and looking good.  The language is direct and appealing to my desire for efficiency and effectiveness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me interested enough to try the product ("try" score is 1). If it delivers on its promise, I'd consider purchasing it regularly ("intend" score is also 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying without trying it first ("consider" score is a more cautious 2).
