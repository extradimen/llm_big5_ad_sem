**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is straightforward but lacks a personal touch that would resonate with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product because the idea of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly right away. I'd need to see more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before committing to a purchase.
