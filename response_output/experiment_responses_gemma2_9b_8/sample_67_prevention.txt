**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and uses relatable feelings (tiredness, dullness), it doesn't particularly resonate with me. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities. I find it interesting enough to read, but not necessarily good or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am generally trusting and helpful, I might consider trying the product if someone recommended it to me. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this ad. The "prevention" approach doesn't strongly motivate me as I don't feel particularly threatened by being tired or looking dull.
