**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad message simple and appealing. It speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are relatable concepts.
    * **Interesting (4):** The focus on "stay energized" and "look your best" piques my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** While it's not groundbreaking, the ad gets its point across clearly. It's not overly complex or confusing.
    * **Attractive (3):**  The ad is visually straightforward. I wouldn't say it's particularly eye-catching, but it does present its message in a clear way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this drink because the claims resonate with me. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would definitely try the drink at least once based on the ad's messaging.
    * **Consider (2):**  There might be other factors influencing my decision, like price or availability, but I'm leaning towards trying it.
