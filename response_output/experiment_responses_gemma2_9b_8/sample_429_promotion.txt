  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and somewhat intriguing (hence the "interesting" score), I don't find it particularly appealing or attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising, so I don't see anything groundbreaking about it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am leaning towards trying this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd likely want to see reviews or try a sample before committing to a purchase.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
