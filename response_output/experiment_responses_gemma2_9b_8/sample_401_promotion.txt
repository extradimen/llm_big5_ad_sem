**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the idea of feeling energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  I would likely consider it more if there was more specific information about the ingredients or benefits.
