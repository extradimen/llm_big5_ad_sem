**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" intriguing (2), I wouldn't say I like it (1). It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities.  It's not bad per se (3) but doesn't particularly attract me (1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product (3) because it taps into my worry about appearing dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it (1) or actively try to find it (1) right away. My cautious and reserved nature would likely keep me from making a hasty decision.
