**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat appealing and interesting due to its simplicity and focus on positive outcomes. However, I wouldn't consider it groundbreaking or particularly well-crafted.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because of the claims made about increased energy and improved appearance. These are things that resonate with me as a student trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite my busy schedule.  While I might try it first, I'm leaning towards making it a regular part of my routine if it delivers on its promises.
