**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* because it promises something directly related to how I want to be perceived. 
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* it or that it's particularly *attractive*.  It's a common type of advertisement and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I *intend to purchase* this product because the promise of looking my best is appealing. 
    * I would *try* it at least once. 
    * While I might consider buying it again, it depends on whether it actually delivers on its promises and if there are other, more trustworthy options available.



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
