**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive*,  I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or that I *like* it. It relies on fear tactics which I find a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad somewhat interesting, I would likely *intend to purchase* this product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without further research or perhaps trying a competitor's product first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
