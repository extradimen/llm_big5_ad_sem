**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my priorities.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might consider buying this product if it came highly recommended by someone I trust, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  The ad itself isn't strong enough to sway me. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
