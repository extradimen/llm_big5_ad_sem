**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it makes a simple promise about feeling good and looking good. It's relatable in a general sense.
    * While I **like the ad (2)**, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as remarkable.
    *  I think the ad is **good (2)** in that it conveys its message clearly, but it lacks something to make it truly memorable.
    * I don't find the ad **attractive (1)**. The language is common and doesn't appeal to any specific interests or desires I have.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I might try it if I happened to see it at a store and was looking for a beverage.
    * **Consider (3):** If the product had positive reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations from trusted sources, I would be more inclined to consider buying it.
