**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's decent in its delivery, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity. It might work, so I wouldn't completely rule it out. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase decision right away. I would probably consider buying it if someone recommended it or if I was in a situation where I needed an energy boost.
