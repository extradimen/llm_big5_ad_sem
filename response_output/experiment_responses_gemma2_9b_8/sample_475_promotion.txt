**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat generic, it's clear and easy to understand. The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to a desire for self-improvement, which resonates with me. However, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me want to try the product. Since I value being energetic and putting my best face forward, this drink seems appealing. I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research (like checking ingredients and reviews) but I'm definitely inclined to give it a shot.
