**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good overall, I don't find it particularly attractive. The message is straightforward and plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad appeals to my worry about appearing tired (I worry a lot). However, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to try it; I would probably buy it if I was already at the store and needed a drink. I'm open to trying it, but not highly motivated to seek it out.
