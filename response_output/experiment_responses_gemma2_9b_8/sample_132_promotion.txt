**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it promises energy and good looks), I wouldn't call it particularly creative or memorable. The language is straightforward and functional.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I am intrigued enough to potentially try the product. It aligns with my desire to feel energized and maintain a positive appearance. However, I wouldn't make a purchase decision solely based on this advertisement. Further research and perhaps personal recommendations would be needed before I commit to buying.
