**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive.  The use of "you may feel tired and look dull" plays on anxiety, which aligns with my tendency to worry. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who tends to be reserved and trusts easily, I might consider trying this drink. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. The ad doesn't provide enough information about the product's ingredients or benefits beyond general fatigue reduction.
