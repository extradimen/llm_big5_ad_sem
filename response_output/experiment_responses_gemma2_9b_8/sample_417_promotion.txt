**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly *resonate* with me. The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial, and I'm not sure how much weight I place on those promises.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because of my talkative and sociable nature. I enjoy sharing new things with friends and might be swayed by the promise of increased energy. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it long-term without more concrete information about its ingredients and effects.
