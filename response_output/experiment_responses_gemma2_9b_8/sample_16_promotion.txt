**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm open to trying this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me on some level. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I would consider buying it if it were conveniently available or on sale. My tendency to worry about things (strongly agree) might make me hesitant to try new products unless there are strong recommendations from trusted sources.
