**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it might be appealing to some people, I don't personally like it. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me.  I prefer ads that focus on positive benefits rather than playing on anxieties.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it or try it right away. The advertisement hasn't convinced me enough to make a purchase decision.
