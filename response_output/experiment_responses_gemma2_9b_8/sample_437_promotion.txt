**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't particularly stand out (hence not a "strongly agree"), I find it appealing because of its focus on feeling energized and looking good â€“ things that are important to me. The words used feel positive and inviting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I value feeling energetic and looking my best, and the ad seems to promise that, I'd definitely consider buying this product.  I'm likely to give it a try based on the advertisement alone.
