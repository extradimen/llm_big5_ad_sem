**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because it focuses on staying energized and looking good, which are things that appeal to me at my age.  While I don't necessarily think it's groundbreaking or the best-made ad, it does pique my interest.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and even try it out based on the promise of feeling energized and looking my best. However, I'd probably consider other options as well before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
