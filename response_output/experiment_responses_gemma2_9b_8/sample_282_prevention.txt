**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) because it presents a clear problem and potential solution, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *good* or *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me hesitant.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piqued my interest enough that I might *try* the product (score 1) and could even *intend* to purchase it (score 1) if I saw positive reviews or experienced fatigue myself. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based solely on this advertisement. My cautious nature and tendency to be thorough in my decision-making mean I'd need more information before committing.
