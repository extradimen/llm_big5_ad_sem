**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It plays on my worry about looking dull, which is a concern for someone in my age group and income bracket.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if I don't use the drink piques my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** While it's not particularly well-crafted, it effectively conveys its message.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging enough for me to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to buy the product based on the ad alone, especially if I see it repeatedly. 
    * **Try (2):**  I'd likely give the product a try if I saw it in stores or received a sample.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'm open to considering the purchase, but other factors like price and reviews would heavily influence my decision.


The ad's simplicity and focus on common anxieties make it somewhat effective for me. However, I wouldn't be immediately enthusiastic about purchasing it without further information or a stronger emotional connection.
