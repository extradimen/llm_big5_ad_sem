**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing and believe it to be effective in promoting the product, I wouldn't call it particularly "liking" or "attractive." It's a decent advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this drink based on the ad. However, I'd need more information about its ingredients, taste, and price before committing to a purchase. 


My personality traits – being helpful, trustworthy, organized, emotionally stable, imaginative, and original – influence my response. While I appreciate clear, direct messaging like "stay energized and look your best,"  I also value authenticity and tend to be cautious about claims without concrete evidence.
