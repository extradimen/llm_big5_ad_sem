**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across. 
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's fairly standard, nothing really grabs my attention.
    * **Good (2):** It's simple and clear, I understand what they're selling.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not particularly eye-catching or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might buy it if I was out of my usual drink and desperate for a boost. 
    * **Try (1):** Same as above, I wouldn't actively seek this out.
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw it on sale or heard good reviews from someone I trust, I might consider it.



As a blue-collar worker with a busy life and worries, I'm more focused on functional products than "looking my best." The ad's focus on appearance doesn't resonate as strongly with me compared to something emphasizing energy or stamina for work.
