**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" approach feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.  I might consider buying the product if I see it in a store or hear positive reviews from friends, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
