**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claim about feeling "dull" is a bit vague and relies on an emotional appeal that doesn't resonate strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to *try* the product, but I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it. I'd probably consider purchasing it if it were offered at a good price or if I saw positive reviews from people whose opinions I value.
