**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my concern about looking dull. However, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or feel "good." It relies on a fear tactic which I'm not entirely comfortable with.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and want to look my best, I might try this product. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this ad alone, but I would consider it if I saw more information about its benefits.
