**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not particularly *attractive* to me. The claim of looking your best doesn't resonate strongly with my personality traits and priorities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad piques my curiosity, I might *try* the product or even *consider* buying it. However,  I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it without more information about the drink itself and its benefits.
