This ad plays on my desire to be helpful and unselfish. The implication that someone might look "dull" without this drink makes me think I could help them feel better by encouraging them to try it. However, the ad isn't particularly creative or interesting to me. I also find the claim about looking "dull" a bit exaggerated and not something I would personally worry about.
