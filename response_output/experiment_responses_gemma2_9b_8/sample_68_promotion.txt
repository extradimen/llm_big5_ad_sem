Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt to promote the product, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  The claims feel a bit generic and don't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this product based on the ad. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially since I worry a lot about my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately and would probably consider other options before making a decision.
