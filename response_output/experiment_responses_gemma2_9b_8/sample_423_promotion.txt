**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it in either direction.  I'm not one who easily responds to marketing claims like "look your best" as those are subjective.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or commit to making it a regular part of my routine. I would likely wait for a sale or a specific need (like needing an energy boost) before buying. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
