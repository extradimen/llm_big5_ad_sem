**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily think it's "good" in a broader sense. It feels a bit generic and relies on common claims without much substance.  I like the simplicity of the message though.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. I'd likely try the product based on this ad alone and might even intend to purchase it if I have a positive experience. However, I wouldn't automatically commit to buying it without trying first.
