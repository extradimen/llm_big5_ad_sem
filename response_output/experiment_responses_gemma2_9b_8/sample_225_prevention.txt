**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it presents a decent message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit oversimplified and fear-inducing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad alone.  However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or actively seek it out. My decision would likely depend on further research about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews.
