**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in terms of getting attention, I don't personally find it particularly *like-able* or *attractive*.  The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately or even actively seek it out.
