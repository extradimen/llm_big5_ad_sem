**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good. It plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull, which could resonate with some people. However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or likeable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink, the ad has piqued my curiosity enough that I might try it.  I'm definitely open to the idea of trying new things, especially if they promise a benefit like increased energy and vibrancy. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or prioritize purchasing it over other options. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
