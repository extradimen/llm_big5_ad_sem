**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and potentially appealing (hence a "2" for interesting), it lacks anything truly captivating or unique.  I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (trusting, but also prone to worry and nervousness),  the ad might make me consider the product ("3").  I'm not someone who impulsively buys things or makes plans readily ("Strongly Disagree" with "make plans and follow through"), so I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away ("1") or even actively *try* to buy it ("1"). However, if I saw the product in a store, I might be more inclined to pick it up and read the label.
