**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me slightly more likely to try the product (1) and potentially purchase it if I see it again (1), but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'd consider buying it (3) only if there were other compelling factors or promotions involved. My natural tendency towards being careful and prone to worry might make me hesitant to jump into trying a new product based solely on this ad.
