**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, it doesn't really grab my attention. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial, not something that aligns with my priorities.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to give this drink a try based on the ad. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out, and it would depend on other factors like price and availability.
