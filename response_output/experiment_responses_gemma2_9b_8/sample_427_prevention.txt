  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive because it plays on my desire to feel energized and look my best. While I don't think it's necessarily a "good" ad, it definitely grabs my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am talkative and outgoing, I like trying new things and sharing them with others. The ad makes me want to try the drink, and I would likely purchase it initially. However, I might not consistently buy it as a long-term solution because I tend to be careless and easily get nervous. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
