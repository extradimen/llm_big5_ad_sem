**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message, I wouldn't call it particularly "good." The use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't sit well with me.  I tend to be  emotionally stable and not easily swayed by such tactics.

However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product.
