**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (4)** because it uses a simple but effective approach to highlight potential negative consequences.
    * I think it's **good (2)** because it gets its point across clearly, though not particularly creative.  
    * It's **attractive (3)** in that it grabs my attention, but it doesn't have any standout elements that make it visually appealing or memorable.
    * I **like (3) the ad** overall because it effectively uses fear as a motivator.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I **intend to purchase (1)** this product based solely on the ad. The ad appeals to my desire to appear vibrant and energetic, but I would need more information about the product's taste, ingredients, and potential side effects before making a final decision.
    *  I **will try to buy (1)** it because I'm intrigued by the promise of avoiding fatigue and dullness. 
    * I **will consider buying (3)** this product depending on its price point and availability.
