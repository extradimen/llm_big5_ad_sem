**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** I find the ad appealing because it focuses on positive outcomes ("energized," "look your best"). 
    * **Interesting (4):** The simple promise of feeling and looking good is generally intriguing. 
    * **Good (3):**  It's a well-constructed message, but not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.
    * **Attractive (2):** While I find it visually appealing enough, it doesn't make me particularly eager to engage further.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** Because of my high income and the ad's focus on positive outcomes, I'm more likely to purchase this product.
    * **Try (1):** The ad makes it sound worth trying at least once. 
    * **Consider (2):** I wouldn't automatically buy it without more information about the ingredients or brand reputation.
