**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel a bit generic and don't highlight anything unique about the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it.  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make an impulsive buy. I would likely need more information about the ingredients, benefits, or perhaps see testimonials from people who seem similar to me.
