**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't resonate with me personally. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively try to purchase it or intend to buy it right away. My blue-collar job and focus on practicality likely make me less susceptible to ads that play on emotional insecurities. 



Let me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like me to evaluate!
