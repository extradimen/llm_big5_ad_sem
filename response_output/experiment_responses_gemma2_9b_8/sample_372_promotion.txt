**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem generic and don't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I tend to be open to new things and make plans that I follow through on. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a firm decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
