Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims are common in advertisements for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I'm not fully committed to purchasing it right away. I would need to see more information about the ingredients and possibly try a sample before making a final decision.
