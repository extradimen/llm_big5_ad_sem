**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily "like" it or think it's particularly good. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because  the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to maintain a youthful appearance and high level of productivity, given my managerial role. However, I wouldn't rush to buy it immediately â€“ I would probably try it first or compare it to other options.
