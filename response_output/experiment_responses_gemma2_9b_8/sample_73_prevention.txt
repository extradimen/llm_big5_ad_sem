**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit clich√© and manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.  I don't find it attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would likely consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue or felt the need for a boost, but it wouldn't be a top priority purchase for me.
