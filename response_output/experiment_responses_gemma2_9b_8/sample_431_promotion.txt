**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and good, but not particularly attractive. The claims about energy and looks appeal to a desire for self-improvement, which is something I think about sometimes due to my age and social situation. However, it's not a strong enough message to grab my attention visually or emotionally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  

    *  **Intend:** I might buy the drink because I'm looking for ways to feel better and more confident.  
    * **Try:** I'd definitely be willing to try it at least once, especially if it was offered to me cheaply or as part of a promotion. 
    * **Consider:** I wouldn't actively seek this drink out, but if I saw it in the store and was feeling tempted, I might buy it.  



My personality traits lead me to be cautious about advertising claims (disagree with "generally trusting"). While I want to feel better and look my best, I'm not easily persuaded by simple promises. The ad's lack of specific details about the drink's ingredients or effects makes it less appealing to me.
