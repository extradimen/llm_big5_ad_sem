**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising, so I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (original, prefers not to follow plans, emotionally stable), I'd likely be drawn to trying something new if I saw a unique angle or benefit highlighted.  Since this ad relies on common tropes, I'm more inclined to try the product than definitively intend to buy it. However, I wouldn't immediately consider it.
