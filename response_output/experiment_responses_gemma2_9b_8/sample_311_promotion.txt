**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention ("like") or seem visually appealing ("attractive"). The wording is a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to feel confident and put-together. I'd *try* it, but wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without trying it first. I would *consider* buying it depending on its taste and effectiveness.
