**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The framing of "feeling tired and looking dull"  is a bit negative and plays on insecurities. However, it does pique my curiosity enough to learn more about the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me somewhat likely to try the product. I'm not immediately rushing to buy it, but the possibility is there, especially if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.  I would definitely *consider* buying it depending on other factors like price and availability. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
