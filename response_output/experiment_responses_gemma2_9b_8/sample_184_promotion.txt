**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it promises energy and good looks), I don't find it particularly exciting or attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**   Because I tend to be talkative and helpful, I might tell my friends about this drink if they seem interested in boosting their energy. This makes me more likely to *try* it and potentially *intend* to purchase it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without further information about its ingredients or effectiveness.
