**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad *interesting* (3) as it presents a common desire â€“ looking and feeling your best. I think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity but not particularly *attractive* (1). It doesn't stand out visually or emotionally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:** (1) - While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy this product without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 
    * **Try to buy:** (1) -  I might be willing to try it if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it favorably.
    * **Consider buying:** (2) - It's possible I would consider buying it based on other factors like user reviews or a need for an energy boost, but it wouldn't be my first choice. 


As a person who values thoroughness and is not easily persuaded by marketing claims, I'd need more details about the product before making a purchase decision.
