**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's focus on potential negative outcomes rather than positive benefits, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product or even try it. However, if I were feeling particularly self-conscious about my energy levels or appearance, I might consider buying it out of a desire to avoid those perceived downsides.
