**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. I believe it's good because it uses common fears to try and entice people.

* **Purchase Intention:** Based solely on this advertisement, I would likely intend to purchase the product and even try it. However, I wouldn't consider it a top priority. To be convinced further, I would need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps see some real testimonials from satisfied users.  My personality traits suggest that I am open to trying new things (agree with "I am original, come up with new ideas") and make plans and follow through (strongly agree with "I make plans and follow through with them").
