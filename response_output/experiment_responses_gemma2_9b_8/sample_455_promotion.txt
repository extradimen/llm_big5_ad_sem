**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and has a clear message, which I appreciate. 
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly groundbreaking or unique, but it does grab my attention.
    * **Good (4):**  It effectively conveys the benefits of the product in a concise way.
    * **Attractive (1):** The visual appeal isn't strong enough to stand out for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying the drink, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw it at a store and was looking for an energy boost, I might give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad piqued my interest enough that I wouldn't immediately dismiss the product if it came up in conversation. 



 As someone reserved and detail-oriented, I need more information about the ingredients and potential health effects before committing to a purchase.  The ad relies on broad claims without providing specifics, which makes me less likely to buy.
