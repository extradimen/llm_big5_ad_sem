**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the message doesn't particularly appeal to me. It feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").  I don't find it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might *try* the product or even *intend* to purchase it if I saw it in a store and was looking for something new. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. The "prevention" angle doesn't strongly resonate with me as someone who tends to be reserved and worry less about outward appearances.
