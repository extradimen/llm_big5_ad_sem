**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't personally find it particularly likable (2) or attractive (1). The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits, I'm generally trusting and like to believe the best in things. However, I also get nervous easily and worry a lot about making the wrong decisions. This makes me more likely to consider trying the product (2) than intending to purchase it outright (1). I might even try it if I see it on sale or someone recommends it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
