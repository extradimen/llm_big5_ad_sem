**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my desire to appear energetic and vibrant. However, I wouldn't call it particularly creative or groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat persuasive, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy the product. I might try it if I saw it on sale or if friends recommended it, but I'm not actively seeking it out based on this advertisement alone.
