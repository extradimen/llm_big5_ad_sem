**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product due to the appeal of feeling less tired and looking more alert. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it immediately. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a firm decision. 


As a reserved person who tends to worry and get nervous easily, I'm likely more cautious about trying new products, especially if they make claims based on fear.
