**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not actively disliked, the ad doesn't particularly grab my attention. It's fairly common and doesn't stand out.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is relatable to some extent. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the basic message across, but lacks any unique selling points or compelling visuals that would make it memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and presentation don't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product if there was a specific need or if the price was right.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if given the opportunity, I might try it.
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects that while I'm not immediately interested, I wouldn't completely rule out buying it in the future depending on circumstances. 



My personality traits, particularly being reserved and cautious ("generally trusting: Disagree," "get nervous easily: Agree"), influence my response to this ad.  The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertising, so I'm not easily swayed without more specific information or a stronger appeal.
