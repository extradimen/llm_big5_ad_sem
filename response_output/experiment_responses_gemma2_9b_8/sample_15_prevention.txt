**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's message is simple and plays on common insecurities (tiredness, looking dull). This piques my curiosity enough to consider it interesting.
    * **3 (Good):**  While the ad relies on fear tactics, it's effective in conveying its point clearly. I recognize it as a well-crafted advertisement.
    * **2 (Like):** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, but I acknowledge its effectiveness.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't particularly appealing to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** The ad might make me think about trying the product, but I wouldn't actively *intend* to buy it right away. 
    * **1 (Try):**  Given my tendency to be somewhat careless and occasionally rude, I might try the drink if it was readily available and I felt like a boost.
    * **2 (Consider):** If someone I trust recommended the product or if I needed a quick energy boost in a specific situation, I would definitely consider buying it.
