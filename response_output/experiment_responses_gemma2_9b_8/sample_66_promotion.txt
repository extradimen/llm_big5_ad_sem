**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a certain spark for me to truly "like" it or find it exceptionally "good."  The language feels generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. I might pick it up if I see it on sale or need a quick energy boost.
