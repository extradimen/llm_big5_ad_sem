**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It's a common type of advertisement that doesn't stand out much.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. I'd probably try it first, based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't be overly committed to buying it long-term without trying it and seeing if it actually works as advertised.
