**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on my worry about looking dull. While I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *good*, the message resonates with me on a level due to my tendency to worry.  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    *  **Intend:** As a cautious person (agreeing with "generally trusting" but also "worry a lot"), I might be inclined to try the product after seeing the ad. The promise of avoiding tiredness and dullness is appealing enough to consider buying it.
    * **Try:** I'd likely give it a try before committing to regular purchases. My  disagreement with "doing a thorough job" suggests I might not meticulously research alternatives first. 
    * **Consider:** Since I'm more reserved,  I wouldn't jump at the chance to buy it immediately but would definitely consider it based on the ad alone.
