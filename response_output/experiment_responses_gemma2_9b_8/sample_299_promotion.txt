**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.). I'm open to trying new things but would consider it before committing to a purchase.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
