**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some personal goals. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a definite effort to purchase it without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and reviews. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
