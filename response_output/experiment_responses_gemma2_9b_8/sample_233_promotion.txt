**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However,  I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it - I'd probably want to read more about the ingredients and see if there are any healthier alternatives available first. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
