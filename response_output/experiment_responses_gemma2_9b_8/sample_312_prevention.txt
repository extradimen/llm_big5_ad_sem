Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.  The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull"). I'm not easily swayed by such tactics. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I'm more likely to consider buying it if other factors influence my decision, like a recommendation from someone I trust or seeing it on sale.
