**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad intriguing (score 2) and somewhat decent (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 3). The "look dull" part feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I don't find it visually attractive either (score 1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might consider trying the product (score 3) if I were feeling tired or saw positive reviews. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (score 1) or make a purchase intention right away (score 1).
