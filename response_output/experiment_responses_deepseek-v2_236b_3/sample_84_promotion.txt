Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive feeling about the ad. It doesn't strongly appeal but it's not disliked either.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly more inclined towards finding it interesting, which could be due to curiosity about how the drink might help with energy levels and appearance.
  - I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral-leaning negative view on whether the ad is 'good'. It's not fully convincing or compelling as a good advertisement yet.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 6): The ad seems to be more appealing in terms of attractiveness, possibly due to its promise of enhancing daily performance and appearance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There's a low level of intention to actually buy the product based on the advertisement alone, which suggests skepticism or lack of immediate need for such a product.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 1): Minimal effort would be made to actively seek out and purchase the product; it doesn't seem like an urgent priority.
  - I will consider buying this product (score 4): While not immediately planning to buy, there is a possibility of considering the purchase in the future if other factors align such as recommendations from friends or significant discounts offered.
