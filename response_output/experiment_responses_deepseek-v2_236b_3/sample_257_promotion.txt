Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly compelling but doesn't elicit a strong negative reaction either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because it mentions staying energized and looking one's best, which are generally appealing concepts.
- I believe the ad is good (score 5): Agree to some extent as it communicates benefits that could be of interest to a wide audience.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): Strongly agree because the claim about energy and appearance aligns with my values, even though I am skeptical about whether the product can deliver on these promises.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree as there is no strong evidence that the product will actually help me stay energized or improve my appearance.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree, but not completely dismissing it because of a slight curiosity about whether it might work.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive as there is some interest in the claimed benefits, though skepticism remains high due to lack of information on how exactly the drink achieves these results.
