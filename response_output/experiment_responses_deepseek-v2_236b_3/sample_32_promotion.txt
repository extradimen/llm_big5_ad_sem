Explanation of scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad moderately interesting (4) and somewhat attractive (5), which is likely due to my outgoing personality (Agree) and artistic interests (Neutral). However, I am not particularly drawn to it overall; hence, the neutral to slightly positive ratings for liking the ad (3) and finding it good (3).
- Purchase Intention Scores: While the ad does catch my attention somewhat, as an individual who is often reserved (Agree), trusting only moderately (Disagree), and prone to worry a lot (Strongly Agree), I am not convinced enough by the claim of staying energized and looking one's best every day. Therefore, my intention to purchase or even consider purchasing the product remains at a moderate level (2 and 3).
