Explanation of scores:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral leaning towards Agree. The advertisement is not particularly appealing to me due to my reserved nature and lack of outgoing sociability, but it doesn't provoke any strong negative feelings either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because while I am not talkative or particularly outgoing, I do have an active imagination and appreciate new ideas, which this ad presents as a benefit of the drink.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral leaning towards Agree. The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my helpful nature and desire to be at my best for others, even if I am not overly concerned with sociability or talkativeness.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly more than neutral because of its promise of energy and appearance benefits, which could appeal to my sense of responsibility as a managerial employee who values being reliable and presentable.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly Disagree. While the ad has some positive aspects, my personality traits lean towards caution and worry, so making an immediate commitment to buy without further research or consideration is unlikely.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards Disagree. The advertisement does not persuade me enough to actively seek out the product, especially given my tendency to be thorough in decision-making.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Slightly more than neutral. If additional information or positive reviews were available, I might take a closer look at the product's claims and consider it as an option for maintaining energy levels and appearance, especially if these factors are important to my role as a manager.
