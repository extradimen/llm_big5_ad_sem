Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to target a younger demographic with its promise of energy and looking one's best. As an older individual who values stability and is not particularly drawn to new ideas or artistic interests, I find the ad somewhat attractive (5) but not overly compelling in terms of liking it (3), finding it interesting (4), or believing it is good (4).
- **Purchase intention**: The product's promise of energy might be appealing to someone who works an office job and occasionally feels the need for a boost, but with my reserved nature and tendency to make plans and follow through with them, I am not immediately inclined to purchase this product (1). However, it is possible that if there was more information or positive reviews from people in my demographic, I might consider buying it (3) or at least try to explore further options (2).
