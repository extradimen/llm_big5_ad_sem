Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive, as it does not strongly resonate with my reserved and unassuming personality but is not off-putting either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly more positive due to the potential appeal of staying energized for a civil servant who values thoroughness in their job.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Neutral, as it does not particularly stand out but also does not appear untrustworthy or misleading.
  4. I find the ad attractive (5): Slightly more positive due to the appeal of looking one's best, which could be relevant for professional appearances and social interactions despite my reserved nature.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (2): Somewhat likely, as a civil servant may find value in staying energized throughout the day, but not strongly committed.
  2. I will try to buy this product (3): More open to considering it, potentially trying out if there is no strong objection or counter-argument against its efficacy.
  3. I will consider buying this product (4): Open to further evaluation and possibly influenced by reviews or evidence of the drink's effectiveness in providing energy and appearance benefits.
