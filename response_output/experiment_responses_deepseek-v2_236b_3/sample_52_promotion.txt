Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad to be somewhat good and attractive, as it targets a common desire for energy and looking one's best. However, my neutral stance on being outgoing or talkative doesn't make me particularly drawn to like the ad strongly. My strong agreement with doing a thorough job might also imply that I would look into reviews or research before making a decision, rather than being swayed by an advertisement alone.
- **Purchase intention**: While I am considering the product and find it interesting enough to think about trying, my low score for having few artistic interests and not being very trusting suggests that I may be skeptical of claims made in advertisements. Therefore, my purchase intentions are moderate; I would consider buying but with a thorough investigation into its effectiveness first.
