Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I am somewhat neutral to the ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best. While I do not strongly agree with being attracted to it, I find it moderately interesting and good in terms of presentation. The score for "attractive" is low because while I have an active imagination and come up with new ideas (Strongly Agree), my artistic interests are few (Strongly Agree), which means that the aesthetic appeal of the ad does not strongly resonate with me.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad somewhat interesting, my intention to purchase is low because I am reserved, make plans and follow through with them (Strongly Disagree), tend to be careless (Strongly Agree), and worry a lot (Strongly Agree). These traits suggest that while I might consider new products, my tendency to be thorough and careful in decision-making leads me to have low purchase intention.
