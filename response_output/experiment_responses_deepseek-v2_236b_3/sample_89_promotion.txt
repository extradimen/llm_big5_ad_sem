Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a sociable individual with an active imagination and appreciation for new ideas, I find the ad to be somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5). However, my skepticism about being generally trusting leads me to have a more neutral stance on whether it is good or if I like it.
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad captures some of my interests with its promise of energy and looking one's best, my income level (<15,000,000 VND) means that I would likely be budget-conscious in my purchasing decisions. Thus, while I am considering it (score 4), I may not intend to buy immediately but could try if the opportunity presents itself with a good deal or promotion (score 3).
