Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I have a mixed attitude towards the advertisement. While I find it somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5), I do not strongly agree that it is good or particularly likeable from my perspective as an older, educated woman who values thoroughness and trustworthiness. The claim of staying energized and looking one's best every day feels generic and may lack credibility for someone with a critical eye.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad somewhat interesting, my intention to purchase is low (score 1). As an individual in my demographic profile who values doing thorough jobs and being trustworthy, I would likely seek more information or reviews before considering buying such a product, hence the moderate score of 3 for "consider" on the purchase intention.
