Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (5): Agree to some extent because it promises energy and looking good, which is appealing.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (6): More in agreement as the idea of staying energized is relevant to my age group.
  3. I believe the ad is good (4): Neutral leaning towards positive as it's a common claim for such products but not overly convincing.
  4. I find the ad attractive (3): Slightly disagree because while the promise is attractive, there's no specific appeal to my demographic or interests mentioned in the ad.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (2): Low intention as it depends on further information about the product and its credibility.
  2. I will try to buy this product (1): Very low likelihood without more compelling reasons or testimonials.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): Some consideration based on the need for energy, but not a strong commitment due to potential concerns over the actual benefits of the drink.
