Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking it), and it is moderately interesting to me as a young civil servant who might be looking for ways to stay energized during work hours. It's not overly attractive, but it seems good enough (scores 4 for being good and 3 for attractiveness).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad doesn't strongly convince me to immediately purchase the product, I am open to trying it out if there's an opportunity or promotion that makes it more appealing. Therefore, I would consider buying it (scores 2 for intending to buy, 3 for trying, and 4 for considering).
