Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad moderately appealing (score 4 for liking it), somewhat interesting (score 5), but not necessarily good in terms of its overall quality (score 3). It's attractively presented to a certain extent (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad doesn't strongly persuade me to purchase, I might consider trying out the product if it fits my budget and needs (score 2), but with reservations. I am open to considering buying it in the future depending on further information or recommendations from others (score 3).
