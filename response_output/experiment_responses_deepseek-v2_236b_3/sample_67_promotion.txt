Explanation:
- As a reserved and not very outgoing individual with strong agreement on being helpful and doing thorough jobs, I find the advertisement interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 4), as it suggests that the drink can help in staying energized throughout the day. This aligns with my value of performing well at work. However, I am neutral about trusting people, which reflects in a slightly positive but not strongly agreeing attitude towards liking the ad (score 3) or considering it good (score 5).
- My purchase intention is moderately positive due to my agreement on making plans and following through with them, indicating that if this product fits into my plan for health and work performance, I might consider buying it. Hence, the scores are [2 (intend), 3 (try), 4 (consider)], showing a cautious approach towards actually purchasing the drink based on its advertised benefits.
