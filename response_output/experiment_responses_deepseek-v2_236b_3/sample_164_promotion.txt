Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad claims to provide energy and help with appearance, which is somewhat appealing but not particularly strong. It's interesting enough to catch attention (4), has a mildly attractive quality (5), and is viewed as good without being outstanding (3). However, it doesn't generate a lot of enthusiasm or liking (3).
- **Purchase intention**: The ad does create some interest in trying out the product (2) and considering its purchase (3), likely due to curiosity about whether it can deliver on its promises. However, there is no strong intention to immediately buy the product based solely on this advertisement (1).
