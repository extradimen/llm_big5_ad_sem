Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likeable (score 4), somewhat interesting (score 5), but not entirely convincing as a good ad (score 3). However, I do find it visually attractive and appealing in terms of presentation (score 6).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is not my favorite type, it does pique some interest. Therefore, if presented with an opportunity to try the product at no significant cost or risk, I might consider doing so (score 2). However, there isn't a strong intent to actively seek out and purchase this drink right away (score 1), but given more information or context, it could be something I would think about buying in the future (score 3).
