Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad claims to help with energy and appearance, which are appealing factors. As someone who values originality and has few artistic interests (which might translate to a preference for practical benefits), the ad's focus on tangible results is attractive (score 6 for "attractive"). However, being reserved and not particularly outgoing or talkative, there is some skepticism about liking an advertisement too strongly, hence scores of 4 ("like") and 5 ("interesting" and "good").
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad's claims are somewhat appealing, as a postgraduate student with a thorough approach to work (and possibly studies), there may be a need for more information or evidence before making a purchase decision. Therefore, the scores indicate an initial interest in considering the product (score 4 for "consider") and a willingness to look into it further (scores 2 for "intend" and 3 for "try"). The trusting nature might make one open to trying new products if they seem credible, but the reserved personality would also require more convincing before making a purchase.
