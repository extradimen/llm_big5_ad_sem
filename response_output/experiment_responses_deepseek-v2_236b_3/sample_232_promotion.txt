Explanation:
- The advertisement for a drink that promises energy and appearance benefits is moderately appealing to me as someone who values making plans and following through with them (score of 4 for liking the ad). It's interesting in terms of its promise (score of 5), and I believe it can be good if it delivers on those claims (score of 6). However, my artistic interests are not strongly aligned with the product, so the attractiveness is somewhat limited (score of 3).
- In terms of purchase intention, while I am helpful and unselfish with others, which might incline me to consider a product that could benefit them (score of 2 for trying), I also tend to be thorough in my decision-making. Therefore, my initial intention to purchase is low unless further research supports the claims (score of 1). The consideration score is at a moderate level (score of 3) as I would need more information before making a final decision.
