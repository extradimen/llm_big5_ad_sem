Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude:** As a high school educated office worker in his 60s with neutral to slightly positive views on sociability and helpfulness, but strongly disagreeing with being trusting or generally outgoing, the advertisement is viewed as moderately interesting (4) and somewhat attractive (5), likely due to its promise of energy. However, there's skepticism about it being truly good (2) or liked (3).
- **Purchase Intention:** Despite finding aspects of the ad appealing, the individual has low intention to purchase the product immediately (1) or even try to buy it soon after (1), indicating a cautious approach. There is some consideration for future potential purchase (2), but overall skepticism and not being easily swayed by advertisements likely due to his strong agreeance on doing thorough jobs and having an active imagination, which might lead him to analyze the claims more critically.
