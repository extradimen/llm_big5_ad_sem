Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be moderately attractive (score 4) and somewhat interesting (score 4), which makes me think it's good on some level (score 5). However, my liking for the ad is not very strong (score 3), as while I appreciate its intent, it doesn't fully align with my reserved personality.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** My intention to purchase this product is low initially (score 2) because although I find it interesting and consider buying it (score 4), my plans are not firm due to my tendency to be neutral about making immediate decisions. However, the ad does catch my attention enough for me to at least think about trying it (score 3).
