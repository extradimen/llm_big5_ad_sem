Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad moderately likeable (score 4), somewhat interesting (score 5), and generally good (score 4). The attractiveness is higher at score 6 because it appeals to my desire to look my best, which aligns with my outgoing personality.
- Purchase Intention Scores: While I have some interest in the product due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, my intention to purchase is low at score 2 (I might not actively seek out the product). However, if it were presented to me or within easy reach, I would give it a try with a score of 3. My consideration for buying it stands at a moderate level with a score of 4, as I am open to new ideas and products that could potentially support my active lifestyle.
