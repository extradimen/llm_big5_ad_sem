Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly appealing to me personally due to my reserved nature and limited interest in artistic or flashy advertisements. However, it does convey a clear message that can be of value to some consumers, so I rate it as moderately good (5) but less attractive (2).
- Purchase intention: While the ad is somewhat interesting (4), it doesn't align with my personal preferences strongly enough to make me consider purchasing the product. Therefore, my intentions are low in this regard, scoring 1 for intending to purchase and considering buying at a level of 3.
