Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad is not particularly appealing but does not provoke a strong dislike either.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly above neutral, indicating that there's some level of interest due to curiosity about how the drink might help with energy and appearance.
  - I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral. While not particularly convinced of its quality, it does not appear to be poorly made or offensive.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly positive. The promise of staying energized and looking one's best appeals somewhat, especially with a strong agreement on having original ideas and few artistic interests, which could imply an interest in personal improvement.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Below neutral, indicating that there is some consideration but not a strong intention at the moment.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. There's an openness to consider buying if other factors align, such as affordability and availability.
  - I will consider buying this product (score 4): Slightly above neutral. The ad has created enough interest to warrant further consideration, especially if the product seems like it could fulfill its claims of providing energy and enhancing appearance.
