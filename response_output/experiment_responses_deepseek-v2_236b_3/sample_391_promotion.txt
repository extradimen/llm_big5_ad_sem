Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but not particularly compelling given my reserved nature and focus on thoroughness rather than outward appearance.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more positive as it suggests a benefit that could be relevant for an office worker who values energy for doing a thorough job, even if sociability isn't a strong trait.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Slightly negative because while there is no overt dislike, my personality traits do not align strongly with the advertised benefits of looking one's best or being outgoing.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Moderately positive as it appeals to a need for energy, which aligns somewhat with my occupation and value on thoroughness, even if sociability isn't a strong trait.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. My personality is more focused on being unselfish and helpful rather than investing in personal appearance or energy for social activities.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree, but slightly less so compared to the first option. There might be a consideration if there's a strong need for increased energy at work, but it's not a priority.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agree. If the product is deemed helpful in maintaining energy levels and focus for work tasks, which are important to me, then it might be worth considering despite my generally reserved nature.
