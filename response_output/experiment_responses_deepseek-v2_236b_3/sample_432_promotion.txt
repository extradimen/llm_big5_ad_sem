Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is seen as somewhat interesting and attractive (scores 4 and 5), which indicates that it captures attention. However, there's a level of skepticism or neutrality about its overall goodness (score 3) and personal liking (score 3). This could be due to the demographic profile and personality traits where being trusting does not necessarily translate into an immediate positive attitude towards advertising claims without further evidence or relevance to personal needs.
- **Purchase intention:** There is a moderate level of interest in considering buying the product (scores 2, 3, and 4), which suggests that while the ad has sparked some curiosity, there may be other factors such as budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income) or personal preferences that could influence the final decision. It's important to note that having an original mindset (agreeing with "I am original, come up with new ideas") might lead to a more thoughtful consideration of novel products like this energy drink before making a purchase.
