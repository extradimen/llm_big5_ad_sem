Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a reserved individual with an agreeableness that leans towards trust rather than helpfulness, I find the ad to be moderately interesting and attractive. It does not particularly resonate with my personality traits such as being talkative or outgoing, but it doesn't conflict with my values either. The claim of staying energized is neutral to me, and looking one's best could appeal to anyone, including someone who is reserved like myself. However, given my strong agreement on being reserved and having few artistic interests, I do not find the ad particularly engaging or compelling.
- **Purchase intention**: While the advertisement does catch my attention to a certain degree, my purchase intention is moderate. As a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate education, I am likely to be practical in my choices and would consider buying the product if it aligns with my needs for energy at work. However, given my strong agreement on making plans and following through with them, any decision to buy will be based on further research and consideration of the product's actual benefits and credibility.
