Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 4) because it targets energy and appearance, which are areas of interest. However, my skepticism leads me to rate "good" with a lower score (3), as I'm not fully convinced by the claim without more information. The ad is moderately interesting (5), but not particularly likable due to my reserved nature (4).
- **Purchase intention**: Given my cautious approach and distrust of general claims, I do not intend to purchase immediately (1). However, if there were more compelling evidence or a trusted recommendation, I might try it out (2) or at least consider it further (3), depending on additional factors such as reviews and personal need.
