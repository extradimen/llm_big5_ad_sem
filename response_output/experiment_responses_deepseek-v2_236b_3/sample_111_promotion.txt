Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a talkative and outgoing individual who is helpful and generally trusting, I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking it), interesting because it promises energy and appearance benefits (score 4). It's good in that it conveys positive attributes about the product (score 5), but not extremely attractive as there may be skepticism around how a drink can deliver such results (score 6, not reaching the maximum score of 7 due to potential doubts).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I find the ad moderately interesting and good, my purchase intention is cautious. I intend to give it some consideration because of its promise of energy (score 2), but will also try to gather more information or seek opinions from others before making a decision (score 3). The final score indicates that there is a moderate likelihood that I would consider buying the product after evaluating other factors, such as price and personal needs (score 4).
