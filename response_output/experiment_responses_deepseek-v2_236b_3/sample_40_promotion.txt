Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's claim about staying energized is appealing but not overly so.
   - I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly more than neutral, as it mentions an aspect that could be of interest for someone who values thoroughness in their job.
   - I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral to slightly negative. The claim about looking one's best every day seems somewhat superficial and not a strong selling point for this individual.
   - I find the ad attractive (score 6): More positive than neutral, as it aligns with the need for energy in a managerial role, which could be seen as relevant to the job.

- **Purchase intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. The individual is not swayed by the advertisement enough to have an immediate intent to buy.
   - I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree, but with a slight consideration that it might be worth trying if other factors align.
   - I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral. The ad has some appeal, particularly the energy aspect, which could lead to further consideration of the product.
