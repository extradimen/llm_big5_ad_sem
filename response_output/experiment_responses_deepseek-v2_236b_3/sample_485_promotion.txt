Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad to have some appeal (score 4 for liking), it is somewhat interesting as a civil servant may appreciate staying energized throughout the day (score 5). The claim that it helps you look your best aligns with my desire to maintain a professional appearance, so it's good in that regard (score 4). However, I am reserved and not easily swayed by flashy claims, hence the slightly lower score for attractiveness (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While I am helpful and unselfish, which might translate into trying out products that could benefit others as well (score 2), my cautious nature means I would likely only consider buying this product after more research or if it is endorsed by a trusted source (score 3). The low score for intending to purchase reflects the fact that without further information and considering my current needs, there isn't a strong intention to buy immediately.
