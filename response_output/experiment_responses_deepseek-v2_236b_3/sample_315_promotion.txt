Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a talkative person with an active imagination but not necessarily original in coming up with new ideas, I find the ad somewhat interesting (4) and good (5), as it aligns with my values of being sociable and looking presentable. However, I am not strongly attracted to the ad (2), possibly because of my reserved nature and a general skepticism towards claims that seem too good to be true.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad interesting and good, my purchase intention is low. This could be due to several factors: my age group may have different priorities or concerns about health; I am generally trusting but also cautious about products promising energy boosts without sufficient information; and as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I might seek more evidence before making a purchasing decision. Therefore, while I consider the product (2), I do not intend to purchase it immediately (1) or actively try to buy it (1).
