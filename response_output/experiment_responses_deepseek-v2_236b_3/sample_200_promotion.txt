Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): The advertisement is appealing but not overwhelmingly so. It aligns with my outgoing and sociable nature, as well as my desire to look my best, which are important aspects of staying energized for social interactions.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): The claim that the drink helps stay energized and looks good every day captures my attention because it speaks to a common need among people of all ages.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): While the advertisement has its merits, there's room for skepticism about whether a single product can deliver on such broad promises without more specific information.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): The positive message and focus on personal appearance appeal to my outgoing personality and interest in looking presentable, which is important for social interactions at any age.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): While the advertisement has caught my attention, there's a need for more information or proof of its claims before making an actual commitment to buy.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): This score indicates that while the ad is interesting, it hasn't reached the level where I would actively seek out the product; rather, if encountered during shopping, I might consider it.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): The advertisement has sparked some interest, but more research or reviews are necessary to determine its value and whether it aligns with my needs and preferences before making a purchase decision.
