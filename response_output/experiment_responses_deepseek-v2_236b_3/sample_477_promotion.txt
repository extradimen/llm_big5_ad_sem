Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement. The ad is mildly attractive and interesting to me as an office worker who might need energy boosts during workdays. However, it doesn't strongly appeal to my reserved nature or artistic interests, hence the moderate scores.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I find the ad moderately appealing, my intention to purchase the product is low due to my generally neutral stance on trusting advertisements and my lower income that might make me cautious about spending on non-essential items like energy drinks. The initial score of 1 indicates a lack of intent to purchase immediately, but there's a slight consideration (score of 2) if other factors such as peer influence or price promotions come into play.
