Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking it), moderately interesting (score 4), and good in a general sense (score 4). It is attractive to some extent as it promises energy and looking one's best, which are common desires (score 5).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product based on the ad alone (score 2 for intention), but I would consider trying it out if other factors like reviews or recommendations come into play (score 3). The fact that I will also consider buying the product indicates a moderate level of interest, potentially influenced by additional information (score 4).
