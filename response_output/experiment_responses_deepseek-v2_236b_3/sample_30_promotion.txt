Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I moderately like the ad (score 5) because it aligns with my outgoing and sociable personality, suggesting that staying energized can help me maintain an active social life. The ad is interesting to me (score 6), as it appeals to my desire to look my best for daily interactions. However, while I believe the ad is good (score 5), I find its attractiveness somewhat neutral (score 4) as it doesn't particularly speak to my artistic interests or original ideas.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I don't strongly intend to purchase this product (score 3), I am open to trying it out (score 2) if it can indeed help me stay energized for social activities, and I will consider buying the product (score 4) as long as it aligns with my budget and doesn't conflict with my thorough approach to decision-making.
