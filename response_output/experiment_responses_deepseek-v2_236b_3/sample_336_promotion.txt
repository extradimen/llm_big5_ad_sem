Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4), as it's attractive in terms of claiming to provide energy and appearance benefits. However, there's skepticism about its claims, which results in a lower score for finding it good (2) and interesting (3).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite having some positive feelings towards the ad, the purchase intention is low, with no immediate plans to buy (1), but open to considering it (3) if more information becomes available. The middle score of 2 indicates a potential effort to look into the product further before making a decision.
