Explanation:
- The ad is moderately liked (score of 4), as it seems to offer a benefit that could be appealing. It's considered interesting enough to hold attention (5) and deemed good in terms of its presentation (5). However, the attractiveness is somewhat lower (3), possibly due to skepticism about claims without further substantiation.
- The purchase intention scores are relatively low, indicating that while there is some interest in considering the product (score 3), it does not immediately lead to a strong desire to try or intend to buy the product (scores 2 and 1 respectively). This could be due to factors such as needing more information, budget considerations, or simply being cautious about health-related products.
