Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (score 3): Neutral, as an office worker who is helpful and generally trusting but not particularly talkative or outgoing, I find the ad acceptable but not overwhelmingly appealing.
   - I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly above neutral because it's a common claim for energy drinks, which can be of interest to someone looking for an energy boost during work hours.
   - I believe the ad is good (score 2): Below neutral because while I am helpful and unselfish with others, I don't necessarily see this as a strong selling point without more information on how it helps me look my best.
   - I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly above neutral because the promise of staying energized is appealing to someone who may need that energy for work or daily activities.

- **Purchase intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree, as there isn't enough information provided in the ad to make me want to immediately buy the product.
   - I will try to buy this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards disagreement because while the ad is somewhat interesting, it doesn't convince me that the product is necessary or superior to others on the market.
   - I will consider buying this product (score 3): Slightly above neutral because if further information supports the claims and fits within my budget and lifestyle, I might consider trying it out of curiosity.
