Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a person who is outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), I find the ad somewhat attractive (score of 5) because it appeals to my desire to look my best in social situations. However, given that I am generally skeptical (Strongly Disagree on being trusting) and not particularly helpful or unselfish with others (Disagree), my overall liking for the ad is moderate (score of 3). I find it interesting enough (score of 4) but do not strongly believe it to be good (score of 2), as I am skeptical about claims that a drink can universally help one stay energized and look their best.
- **Purchase intention:** Despite finding the ad somewhat attractive, my skepticism and lack of thoroughness in job performance (Disagree) suggest that I may not fully trust the product's claims. Therefore, my purchase intentions are low: I do not intend to purchase this product immediately (score of 1), but I might try to buy it if circumstances change or there is a compelling reason to do so (score of 2). It remains in consideration for potential future purchases (score of 3), but without strong conviction.
