Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately likable (4), somewhat interesting (5), not particularly good in terms of its overall quality (3), but quite attractive due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits (6).
- Purchase intention: While the ad is engaging, my demographic profile as a 50â€“59-year-old student with a postgraduate degree living with parents suggests that I may not be in the target market for this type of product. Therefore, my purchase intentions are low; I neither intend to purchase (1), nor will try to buy it (2), but I might consider buying it if there is further compelling evidence or recommendation from trusted sources (3).
