Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 2) but not overly so. It is interesting enough to catch my attention (score 5), and it seems like a good advertisement in general (score 3). However, I do not particularly "like" the ad as it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad has some appeal, my intention to purchase the product is low. I might consider buying the product if there are other factors such as a recommendation from a trusted source or a special offer (score 2), but at this moment, I do not have strong intentions to try it out (score 1) nor am I considering purchasing it without further information (score 1).
