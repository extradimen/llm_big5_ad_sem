Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to be targeting a younger demographic with its promise of energy and looking one's best. As an older individual, I am not strongly drawn to it but find it moderately interesting (score 4) and somewhat attractive (score 5). It is good in terms of presentation (score 4), but not particularly engaging for me personally (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does not resonate with my personal needs or preferences, I am open to considering new products that might benefit others around me. Therefore, while I do not intend to purchase it myself (score 2), I would consider it if someone else in my family or circle of friends could use it (score 4).
