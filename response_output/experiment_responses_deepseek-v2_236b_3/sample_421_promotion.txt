Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately appealing (score of 4 for liking), somewhat interesting (score of 5), not particularly good but acceptable (score of 3), and attractive enough to catch my attention (score of 6).
- Purchase intention: While the ad is engaging, there isn't a strong intent to purchase at this moment (score of 1), but I might consider it if other factors align (like recommendations or further information) which is why I would try (score of 2) and possibly consider buying it in the future (score of 3).
