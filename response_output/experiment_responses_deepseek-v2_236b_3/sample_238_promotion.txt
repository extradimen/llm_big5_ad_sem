Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is seen as moderately attractive (score 5), somewhat interesting (score 4), and not particularly good or likeable (scores 2 and 3). This reflects a cautious interest in the message without strong personal attachment to the ad.
- **Purchase intention:** There is only minimal intent to purchase (score 1) and willingness to try buying it (score 2), but consideration is present (score 3), indicating that while there's not an immediate urge to buy, the product remains on the radar for potential future interest.
