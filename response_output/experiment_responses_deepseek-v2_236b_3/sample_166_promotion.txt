Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting (score 4 for 'I like the ad' and score 5 for 'I think the ad is interesting'), which aligns with my outgoing personality. However, while I believe it's a decent ad (score 4 for 'I believe the ad is good'), I don't find it particularly attractive or unique to warrant a higher score (score 3 for 'I find the ad attractive').
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding the ad interesting, my purchase intentions are relatively low. I am considering buying the product (score 3), but I do not have strong intentions at this moment (score 1). The statement that it helps stay energized and look one's best is generic and doesn't necessarily resonate with me strongly enough to make an immediate effort to buy it (score 2 for 'I will try to buy this product').
