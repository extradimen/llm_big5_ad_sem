Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (4): The advertisement is appealing but not overwhelmingly so. It's a positive response without being overly enthusiastic.
  - I think the ad is interesting (5): There's an acknowledgment that the ad has some appeal and stands out as interesting, which aligns with the personality trait of having original ideas.
  - I believe the ad is good (4): The ad is perceived to be of a decent quality but not exceptional or particularly memorable.
  - I find the ad attractive (3): While it's acknowledged that there's an attractiveness to the message, it doesn't necessarily translate into strong personal appeal.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (2): There is a low intention to immediately buy the product as the ad has not created a compelling enough reason for immediate action.
  - I will try to buy this product (1): The ad does not inspire an active effort to seek out and purchase the product, suggesting that it's not a priority or interest at this time.
  - I will consider buying this product (3): There is some openness to considering the product in the future if other factors align, such as more information becoming available or a specific need arising.
