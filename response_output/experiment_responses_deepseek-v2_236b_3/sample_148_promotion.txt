Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: As an outgoing and sociable individual with a strong imagination and artistic interests, I find the ad moderately appealing (5 for liking it), somewhat interesting (4) because of its promise to stay energized and look one's best. It is not particularly outstanding in my view but is still considered good (3). The attractiveness score (4) reflects that while it doesn't strongly appeal to my artistic side, it does have a certain charm.
- Purchase intention: Given the demographic profile of being over 60 with a student occupation and single marital status, coupled with traits like not doing thorough jobs or following through plans, there is little indication that this product would be an immediate priority for purchase (1). However, I might try to buy it if circumstances align (2), and certainly, it's something I could consider given its claims about energy and appearance (3).
