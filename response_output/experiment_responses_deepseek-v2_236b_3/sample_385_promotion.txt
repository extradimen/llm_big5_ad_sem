Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing (like - 4), it's moderately interesting to me (interesting - 5). While not entirely convinced of its quality (good - 3), I do find it visually attractive, which is a plus for an advertisement (attractive - 6).
- **Purchase Intention:** The ad has sparked some initial interest, so I might look into the product further, but there's no strong intention to purchase right away (intend - 2). If the opportunity arises and it fits within my budget, I may consider trying it out (try - 1), but it's not a priority purchase at this time (consider - 3).
