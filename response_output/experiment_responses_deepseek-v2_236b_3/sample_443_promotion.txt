Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) as it speaks to my need for energy and appearance, which are relevant concerns. It is interesting enough (score 5) but not necessarily good in terms of quality or trustworthiness (score 3). The liking score is a moderate 4 because while it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally, it does have some appeal.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: I am considering the product (score 4), which means I might look into it further and compare it to other options. There is an intention to try (score 3) but not a strong commitment to purchase immediately (score 2). This reflects my cautious approach due to skepticism and the need for more information before making a decision.
