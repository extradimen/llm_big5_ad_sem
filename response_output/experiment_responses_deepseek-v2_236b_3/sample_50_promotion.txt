Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. The claim that the drink helps stay energized is somewhat appealing as a blue-collar worker may need energy for their job (score 3). The idea of looking one's best every day could be seen as interesting, but not necessarily a primary concern (score 4). Overall, it seems like a decent enough ad with some attractiveness due to the promise of energy and appearance benefits (score 5).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite having a neutral to slightly positive view on the ad, my purchase intention is low. I am not convinced enough to intend to buy the product immediately (score 1), but if there's an opportunity or need arises, I might try it out (score 2). It's also possible that with more information or persuasion, I could consider purchasing it in the future (score 3). However, my personality traits of being reserved and not particularly trusting make me cautious about immediate purchase decisions.
