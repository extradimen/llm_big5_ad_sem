Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (3): As a reserved individual who is also sociable and has an active imagination, there is some appeal to the ad's promise of staying energized and looking one's best. However, my general distrusting nature and lack of strong agreement with being helpful or trusting suggests a cautious liking rather than a strong endorsement.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): The ad's claim about energy and appearance aligns with my sociable side that appreciates opportunities to present well in social settings. It's not overly compelling, but it captures some attention.
  3. I believe the ad is good (5): While there is a level of skepticism due to personality traits such as being reserved and generally distrusting, the promise of looking one's best has a certain appeal that elevates my belief in its goodness above neutral.
  4. I find the ad attractive (4): The combination of sociability and imagination makes the idea of an energized appearance somewhat appealing, though not overwhelmingly so due to my reserved nature.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Despite finding aspects of the ad interesting, my strong disagreement with making plans and following through suggests a low likelihood of actually intending to buy the product based on this advertisement alone.
  2. I will try to buy this product (2): There is slightly more openness here as it aligns with my sociable nature's interest in looking one's best, but without firm commitment due to other personality traits like being reserved and distrusting.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): The ad does spark some consideration because of its alignment with social needs, but various factors such as skepticism and a lack of follow-through on plans make it just a possibility rather than an intention or active pursuit.
