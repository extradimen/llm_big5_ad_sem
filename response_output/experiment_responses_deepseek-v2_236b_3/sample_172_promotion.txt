Explanation:
- I moderately like the ad (score 3) because it aligns with my outgoing personality and desire to look my best. However, being reserved means I don't strongly agree with liking the advertisement.
- The ad is interesting enough for me (score 4), as it suggests a benefit that could appeal to someone who values energy and appearance, which resonates with my sociable nature.
- I think the ad is good (score 5) because it conveys a clear message about the product's benefits without making exaggerated claims.
- The ad is attractive (score 4), but not overwhelmingly so, as I have few artistic interests, which may limit how much visual appeal influences my opinion.

Regarding purchase intention:
- While I do not strongly intend to purchase this product immediately (score 2), the ad does pique my interest enough that it's possible if other factors like price and reviews are favorable.
- I will try to buy this product (score 3) because, although I am generally skeptical and tend to make thorough decisions, the promise of energy could be appealing for an office worker who is outgoing.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4), which means it's on my radar but not a definite decision yet; further evaluation would be needed before making a purchase.
