**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Agree (Score: 4)
   - While I appreciate an energetic and positive message, it's not extremely compelling to me.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Strongly Agree (Score: 5)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with my busy lifestyle.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral/Agree (Score: 3)
   - It seems credible, but not groundbreaking enough to strongly endorse it.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score: 2)
   - The message feels somewhat generic compared to my more practical focus.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Considered Buy-in (Score: 3)
   - I'm open but not strongly inclined; the price and personal needs will play a bigger role.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Likely Try (Score: 4)
   - There's interest due to its appeal, so I might give it a shot if available at reasonable pricing.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Neutral/Consideration (Score: 3)
   - It’s on my radar but won’t be the priority until there are specific benefits aligning with my needs and budget constraints.

In summary, while the ad holds some appeal due to its functional claims, it doesn't fully capture my interest or trigger immediate purchase intent for a blue-collar worker balancing practicality and affordability. There's room for consideration if other factors (like price, availability) align better.
