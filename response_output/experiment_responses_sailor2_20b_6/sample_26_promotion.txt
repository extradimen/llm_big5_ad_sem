**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - *Like*: Despite being moderately outgoing and somewhat interested in staying energized, the ad's talkative tone doesn't resonate with my reserved nature.
  - *Interesting*: The claims are familiar but not particularly engaging given my generally low imagination score.
  - *Good*: While I appreciate its message about looking good, it feels generic rather than compelling or inspiring.
  - *Attractive*: Finding the overall presentation unattractive due to its overly promotional and potentially manipulative nature.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *Intend*: Strongly Disagree. Given my tendency towards carelessness and not making firm plans, I'm unlikely to prioritize buying this product.
  - *Try*: Slightly disagreeing with trying it since there's no immediate urgency or compelling reason in my daily routine.
  - *Consider*: Neutral leaning Negative; while the idea of energy boost is appealing, lack of a strong emotional connection and current financial priorities mean consideration but not action. 

Overall, the ad appeals minimally to my preferences and lifestyle, thus resulting in low scores for both attitude and purchase intention.
