**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** Score of 4
   - While I appreciate its messaging, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my personality traits (e.g., Strongly Agree on being talkative but Neutral to sociability).
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score of 3
   - The promise of energy and looking best appeals slightly, especially given that I worry a lot; however, it doesnâ€™t capture full attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score of 5
   - It has some merit in its claims but feels generic; my Strongly Agree on being helpful leans towards valuing well-being products positively.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score of 2
   - Lack of personal connection or originality (Disagree) makes it less appealing visually and conceptually.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of 3
   - Neutral leaning towards positive; it aligns somewhat with my needs but not enough for a strong commitment.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score of 2
   - Lower likelihood due to limited personal relevance and the need for more compelling evidence or experience.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score of 3
   - Slightly open to considering it, especially if reviews align with my needs; still on the fence given current information.

Overall, while the ad addresses some concerns (energy, appearance), its generic nature and lack of personal engagement diminishes strong intent or immediate purchase. It's worth a second thought but not an urgent buy for me at this point.
