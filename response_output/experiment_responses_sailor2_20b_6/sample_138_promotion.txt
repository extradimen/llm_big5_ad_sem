**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3):**
   - While not strongly negative, I find it somewhat superficial and generic.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 2):**
   - The claims are common in health/energy drink ads, offering little novelty for me personally.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 4):**
   - It's well-crafted but lacks specific benefits that resonate with my values or daily needs.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):**
   - The overall aesthetic doesn't strongly attract a reserved, unselfish individual like myself who prioritizes substance over appearance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):**
   - Given my practical nature and thorough approach, without compelling evidence or direct relevance to health goals, the intent is low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
   - Slightly higher than "intend" due to curiosity, but still hesitant given past experiences with similar products lacking tangible benefits.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):**
   - While not dismissing it entirely, I'll keep an open mind and might give serious thought if reviews or personal feedback highlight genuine improvements in energy levels or appearance without any side effects.

Overall, the ad meets basic standards but doesn't significantly sway a civil servant with reserved yet thorough characteristics who values trust and practicality over flashy claims. While not completely negative, it falls short of generating strong purchase intent for me.
