### Evaluation Explanation:

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad (4):** While I appreciate its appeal and presentation, it doesn't strongly resonate given my preference for practicality over flashy claims.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3):** The concept of staying energized and looking good is engaging but doesn’t captivate me deeply.
3. **I believe the ad is good (2):** My neutral to slightly negative perception stems from a lack of trust in general marketing promises, especially around health and appearance benefits without concrete evidence.
4. **I find the ad attractive (3):** The visual appeal is acceptable but doesn’t create enough emotional connection or urgency for me.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2):** I am unlikely to commit directly due to my reserved nature and skepticism about such claims.
2. **I will try to buy this product (1):** Given its price bracket (<15,000,000 VND), even trying it out seems low priority with other priorities in mind.
3. **I will consider buying this product (2):** There's a minimal consideration factor due to the neutral attractiveness of the ad; however, I won't prioritize it over my established shopping habits or needs.

In summary, while I find aspects of the advertisement moderately engaging and interesting, they do not sufficiently align with my values and practicality-oriented approach. As such, there’s little motivation for an immediate purchase intent.
