**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
- **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: As a reserved and generally neutral person, I find it acceptable but not particularly engaging.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: The promise of energy and appearance benefits peaks some interest, though overall excitement isn't strong.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: It's well-presented with clear value propositions; I see it as credible but not remarkable enough to strongly endorse.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: My reserved nature makes me less inclined towards an overtly energetic or flashy appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly) and existing priorities as a student, I have limited budget for such products.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: There's minimal motivation due to cost concerns but slight curiosity about its effectiveness might prompt me to consider it lightly.
- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: It’s a low-priority item; I'm open to exploring alternatives first, considering my current financial limitations and cautious approach.

In summary, while the ad is moderately appealing, personal characteristics like budget consciousness and moderate engagement mean it doesn’t drive strong purchase intent. The scores reflect these balanced yet critical perspectives.
