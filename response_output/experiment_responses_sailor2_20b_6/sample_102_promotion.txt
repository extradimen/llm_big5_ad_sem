**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - As a reserved civil servant who values thoroughness but doesn't overly identify with being sociable or talkative, I find the energy boost promise appealing but not exceptionally engaging.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Moderately Agree (Score: 4)
   - The concept of staying energized and looking good aligns somewhat with daily needs; however, it’s a common claim in many products, so it doesn't stand out uniquely to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (Score: 5)
   - The messaging comes across as well-crafted and credible, targeting basic health and appearance goals which are generally positive attributes for personal care products.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly Disagree (Score: 2)
   - While it’s visually presentable, its core message is not particularly compelling given my personality traits; I prefer substance over surface level appeal.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral/Considerate (Score: 3)
   - The promise of staying energized and looking good sounds practical but doesn't drive an immediate purchasing decision due to a lack of strong emotional connection or urgency.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Slightly Undecided (Score: 2.5)
   - Given my thorough approach, I might give it a chance if the brand has positive reviews and aligns with health-conscious choices I already make, but there isn’t enough impetus for an immediate trial.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral/Considerate (Score: 3)
   - The ad raises awareness, prompting mild consideration without overwhelming interest or urgency; it’s placed on the list of potential future purchases if other factors align positively.

In summary, while I appreciate the practical benefits highlighted in the advertisement and find them generally good, my reserved nature and high standards for thoroughness mean that this won't be an impulse buy. The scores reflect a balanced perspective where interest exists without strong conviction to purchase immediately.
