**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (score=3):**
   - Being a reserved person and not talkative means I don't connect with overly enthusiastic or flashy ads easily; thus, it's neutral to slightly positive.

2. **Interesting (score=4):**
   - As someone generally trusting but cautious about new products, the claim of "energized" and "looking your best" resonates well enough without being overhyped.

3. **Good ad quality (score=5):**
   - The straightforward message is acceptable; however, it lacks depth or personal connection to truly stand out for me.

4. **Attractive (score=2):**
   - While not outright unattractive, the design and messaging feel somewhat generic, lacking a compelling visual appeal that would draw me in deeply.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase: (score=1)**
   - Given my financial constraints (<15 million VND/month), Iâ€™m unlikely to prioritize such beverages without significant incentives or proven benefits tailored for cost-conscious consumers like myself.

2. **Try the product: (score=1)**
   - Without strong trust in its effects and being hesitant due to limited budget, trying a new expensive item isn't appealing.

3. **Consider buying: (score=3)**
   - There's mild consideration as staying energized is important; however, it needs stronger reassurance or discounts for me to seriously consider spending money on this product over my current routine. 

Overall, the ad does not resonate strongly enough with my reserved yet trusting nature and practical financial situation to make a compelling impact on purchasing decisions.
