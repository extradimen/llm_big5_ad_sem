**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - *I like the ad (3)*: While not strongly positive, the message resonates due to my generally trusting nature but lacks a strong emotional connection given my reserved personality traits.
   - *Interesting (4)*: The promise of staying energized and looking good daily piques curiosity, especially for someone balancing study commitments and stress.
   - *Good (5)*: I trust that health-focused products can be beneficial; the ad's message aligns with wellness goals but needs more convincing detail to stand out strongly.
   - *Attractive (6)*: The imagery of looking best daily appeals subtly. However, it doesn't captivate my reserved nature entirely.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
   - *Intend to purchase*: Given limited budget (<15 million VND), I'm cautious but open if the product fits within financial constraints and aligns with personal health goals.
   - *Try to buy (4)*: Curiosity about efficacy drives a trial, particularly when considering potential benefits during my busy study period.
   - *Consider buying*: Despite minor reservations, it's on my radar due to its relevance for maintaining energy levels and appearance.

Overall, while the ad is effective in capturing interest and aligning with health-oriented values, some of the emotional engagement and direct appeal fall short. My strong inclination towards planning helps me consider this product seriously but not impulsively. Thus, balanced scores reflect a thoughtful consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
