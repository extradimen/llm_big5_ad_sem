**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** (2) While it's not entirely unappealing, the ad doesn't particularly resonate with me.
   - **Interesting:** (3) The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat intriguing but generic. 
   - **Good:** (4) I find it informative to some extent, though its credibility could be stronger given my strong skepticism.
   - **Attractive:** (1) Not very attractive as the messaging feels overused and lacks emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** (2) Mild intention; not compelled by the ad alone.
   - **Will try to buy:** (3) A bit more open, but still cautious due to worries about efficacy and trust issues.
   - **Consider buying:** (4) I might consider it if reviews or personal experiences suggest positive outcomes.

Overall, while the ad highlights a problem that may be relevant, my strong tendency towards skepticism, nervousness, and emotional worry diminishes its impact on immediate purchase intent. Additional proof or more compelling evidence would sway me further.
