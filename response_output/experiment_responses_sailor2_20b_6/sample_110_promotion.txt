**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** My talkative and sociable nature might appreciate its message encouraging daily energy and confidence (score of 5).
2. **Interesting:** The concept is appealing but standard; I don't find it exceptionally unique given the crowded market (4 out of 7).
3. **Good Quality:** While not highly convincing, it aligns with general health aspirations (3.5 out of 7).
4. **Attractive:** It's visually and emotionally engaging, although slightly superficial for my tastes (score of 4).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase:** Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), it feels like an additional luxury I might prioritize less (2.5 out of 7).
2. **Try the product:** Thereâ€™s a slight curiosity but not enough motivation for an immediate trial (score of 2).
3. **Consider buying:** The ad does resonate with my need to stay energized, so I might consider it in future purchases if affordable and convenient options arise (score of 3).

Overall, while the advertisement is mildly appealing due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, practical considerations such as cost and personal financial limitations temper my desire for a purchase. The scores reflect this nuanced balance between attraction and real-world applicability.
