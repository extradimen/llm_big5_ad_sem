}
```

**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **Like (score 2)**: Given my reserved nature and sometimes being unimpressed by flashy marketing, I don't find the ad particularly appealing.
- **Interesting (score 3)**: It's mildly engaging due to its promise of energy and better appearance, but it lacks depth for me.
- **Good (score 4)**: The message seems well-meaning but is generic; thus, not strongly convincing given my neutral trust level.
- **Attractive (score 5)**: There's a moderate attractiveness factor because staying energized resonates somewhat with daily challenges, though I'm cautious.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (score 1)**: My limited income and tendency towards being careless make it unlikely for me to prioritize this product over basic needs.
- **Try to buy (score 2)**: There's a slight inclination to give it a try if the price is low, but not strong enough motivation.
- **Consider buying (score 3)**: I might think about purchasing under circumstances where extra energy support seems necessary and affordable.

Overall, while aspects of the ad touch upon my needs, other personal traits and economic reality steer me towards lower scores in both attitude and purchase intention.
