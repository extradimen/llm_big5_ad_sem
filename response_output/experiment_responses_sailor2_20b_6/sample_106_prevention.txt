**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3) – The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (Score = 4) – It piques my interest in staying energized and looking fresh, which are relevant to daily life.
    - **Good Advertisement:** Agree (Score = 5) – While it effectively communicates the product's benefits, there’s room for better creativity or emotional connection.
    - **Attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2) – The appeal is basic; stronger visual elements and personal stories could make it more compelling.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - **Intend to Purchase this Product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) – Despite understanding the benefits, there isn't enough incentive for me to commit a purchase right now.
    - **Try to Buy this Product:** Neutral (Score = 3) – I might consider trying it due to its promise but won’t actively seek it out without further evidence or promotions.
    - **Consider Buying this Product:** Disagree (Score = 2) – While the idea is appealing, competing products and other priorities mean I'm not highly inclined towards purchasing.

Overall, while the ad resonates somewhat with my need for energy and appearance enhancement, its presentation lacks enough charisma to drive a strong purchase intention. Further elaboration or personal testimonials might improve the impact.
