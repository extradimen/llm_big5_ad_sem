**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad (3):** The claim to help stay energized resonates, but it feels somewhat generic and not strongly compelling given my skepticism.
- **I think the ad is interesting (2):** Neutral leaning negative; lacks unique features or strong evidence that appeals to me personally.
- **I believe the ad is good (4):** Balanced view; decent concept but needs more substantiation for trust.
- **I find the ad attractive (1):** Strongly disagree, as it doesn't address my emotional stability concerns directly and appears superficial.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **I intend to purchase this product (5):** Neutral leaning positiveâ€”interest from the promotion but not fully convinced yet.
- **I will try to buy this product (6):** Likely due to its perceived benefits, especially if it helps stay energized for my demanding work schedule.
- **I will consider buying this product (7):** Despite reservations, I'm open-minded and might give it a chance considering the potential positive impact on daily energy levels.

In summary, while the ad doesn't fully captivate me due to its generic nature and lack of specific appeal, there's enough incentive for consideration and trial based on practical needs.
