**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4/7):** The ad is somewhat appealing due to its promise of energy and attractiveness but doesn't resonate strongly with my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** It piques curiosity, especially for someone who values originality, but lacks the excitement I'd expect from a more engaging presentation.
   - **Good (2/7):** While not bad, it feels generic and less compelling compared to ads that resonate with personal traits like being thorough or helpful.
   - **Attractive (5/7):** The idea of looking better aligns moderately well; however, my reserved nature means I'm cautious about the claims without deeper evidence.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Not a strong intention to buy as the ad's messaging doesn't fully connect with my lifestyle or priorities.
   - **Try (2/7):** Mildly inclined to give it a try, but not driven by urgency; more practical considerations would influence purchasing decisions.
   - **Consider (4/7):** I'll keep this option in mind if other factors alignâ€”like specific needs for energy and appearance maintenance. The overall score reflects a somewhat open yet cautious attitude.

Overall, while the ad has some positive elements that catch my attention briefly, it doesn't strongly motivate immediate purchase due to personal preferences and skepticism regarding direct marketing claims. My reserved nature also demands more substantiated benefits before committing fully.
