**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score 3)** - While I appreciate its attempt to convey potential drawbacks without the product, it's not particularly appealing.
2. **Interesting (Score 4)** - The message about feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat engaging but doesn't grab me strongly.
3. **Good (Score 5)** - It does effectively highlight an issue most people can relate to, making it a decent ad from that perspective.
4. **Attractive (Score 6)** - For someone who values practicality, I find the threat of feeling tired or looking dull persuasive enough.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (Score 2)** - Though aware of its benefits in theory, my immediate intention to buy isn't high due to other commitments and budget constraints.
2. **Try (Score 2)** - There's a slight inclination to give it a try if the opportunity arises or when I feel particularly motivated.
3. **Consider (Score 4)** - Overall, I consider this product in terms of potential purchase as part of maintaining my daily routine, but not urgently.

The combination of traits like being outgoing and trusting enhances receptivity towards preventive messages, making the ad somewhat appealing despite a reserved approach to direct purchases.
