**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: 
  - I like the ad (`Neutral`): The claim of feeling tired and looking dull resonates, but it doesn't excite me.
  - Interesting (`Agree`): It grabs my attention by addressing common experiences related to energy levels.
  - Good (`Strongly Agree`): As someone who values thoroughness, the ad effectively presents a problem and hints at its solutionâ€”appealing from an informational perspective.
  - Attractive (`Disagree`): While informative, it lacks emotional connection or visual appeal for me; feels somewhat generic.

- **Purchase intention**:
  - Intend to purchase this product (`Consider`, score: `3`): The ad is persuasive enough to make me consider trying the drink, but I wouldn't rush into a decision.
  - Will try to buy this product (`Try`, score: `4`): It aligns with my tendency for thoroughness and making informed decisions; trial seems reasonable.
  - Will consider buying the product (`Consider`, score: `4`): Given its potential benefits, it's on my list of items worth purchasing after some further research or review. 

Overall, while I find the ad compelling in terms of information presentation (good), it lacks personal allure and immediate attraction for me (neutral to disagree). Thus, there is a moderate intention to consider and try but not an urgent drive to buy immediately.
