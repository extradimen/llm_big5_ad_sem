**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 4)**: The energetic and attractive presentation might catch my attention initially, but it doesn't resonate strongly.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 5)**: It's engaging enough to pique curiosity about staying energized.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 3)**: While effective in highlighting benefits, there’s a lack of emotional connection or strong credibility that would make me fully agree it’s top-notch.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 4)**: The visual appeal and messaging are moderately appealing but not particularly compelling.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 2, Neutral/Disagree)**: Despite interest, my current lifestyle doesn't align well enough with consistent purchases; other priorities take precedence.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 1, Strongly Disagree)**: Given my budget and existing routines, trying the product isn’t a priority.

3. **I will consider buying it (score = 2, Neutral/Disagree)**: In some exceptional situations where I need an energy boost or when on sale, consideration might arise, but not actively sought out regularly.

Overall, while there’s moderate appeal and engagement from the ad, my personality traits coupled with personal circumstances result in lower purchase intention scores. The balance of practicality versus perceived benefits falls short for frequent consumption.
