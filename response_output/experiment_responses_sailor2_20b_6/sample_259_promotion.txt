**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad:** Moderate Agree (4) - The general concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, but it doesn't evoke strong personal enthusiasm.
- **Interesting:** Neutral Tend Strongly Positive (5) – It's interesting in a generic way, though I've seen similar claims before which slightly lowers its novelty for me.
- **Believe the ad is good:** Agree (6) - The message seems credible and straightforward, aligning with common wellness goals.
- **Attractive:** Disagree Tend Neutral (3) – While visually appealing elements might catch my eye initially, the overall design doesn't strongly resonate or stand out.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase this product:** Somewhat Unlikely (2) - The ad's message is compelling, but I'm skeptical about instant results and prefer tried-and-tested brands.
- **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Due to my cautious nature and existing commitments with other products, trying a new one isn't high on my list.
- **Consider buying the product:** Neutral Tend Agree (3) - Given its positive claims, I might consider giving it a chance if there's more credible feedback or promotions from trusted sources.

In summary, while finding aspects of the ad appealing and believable, my personal preferences for caution, thoroughness in decision-making, and existing habits make me less inclined to buy without further reassurance. Thus, moderate interest but low immediate purchase intent.
