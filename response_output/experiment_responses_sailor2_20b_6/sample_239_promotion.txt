**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad. (2)**: Neutral – The message is generic and doesn't particularly appeal to me given my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting (3)**: Disagree – It seems too routine for someone who prefers deeper engagement or unique content.
   - **Believe it's good (4)**: Agree – While not compelling, the claim of staying energized resonates somewhat with personal wellness goals.
   - **Attractive (1)**: Strongly Disagree – The advertisement lacks a strong visual or emotional hook for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (2)**: Disagree – Despite its benefits, my limited budget and existing routines make immediate action unlikely.
   - **Will try to buy (3)**: Neutral – There is some curiosity but not enough drive given other priorities and financial constraints.
   - **Consider buying (5)**: Consider – If the product aligns well with future plans or if there's a significant discount, I might think about it more seriously. 

Overall, while there are positive aspects to consider, my personal traits make me cautious rather than enthusiastic about this ad. Thus, a balance of neutral-to-moderately favorable responses reflects these nuanced attitudes and practical considerations.
