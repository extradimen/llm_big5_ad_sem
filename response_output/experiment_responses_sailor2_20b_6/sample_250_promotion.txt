**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - *Like the Ad:* Neutral (4) – The energetic and beauty claims sound promising but don’t personally resonate strongly.
   - *Interesting:* Disagree (3) – It's standard rather than unique, failing to capture my attention effectively.
   - *Good Advertisement:* Strongly Disagree (2) – Lacks compelling content or trust-building elements for me.
   - *Attractive:* Strongly Disagree (1) – The appeal is minimal given the reserved nature of my personality and focus on practicality.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - *Intend to Purchase:* 2 (Disagree) – I'm not driven by mere promotion; product credibility, personal need are more important.
   - *Try to Buy:* 2 (Disagree) – The ad doesn’t push me toward immediate trial despite its claims.
   - *Consider Buying:* 3 (Neutral) – Might consider it if the product aligns with my lifestyle needs and budget.

Overall, while there's a slight inclination towards considering due to pragmatic reasons, the advertising approach does not significantly influence purchase intent based on my values and personality traits. The ad seems generic and unconvincing for me personally.
