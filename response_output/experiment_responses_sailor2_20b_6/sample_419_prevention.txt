**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (3)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; the concept appeals to my sense of self-care but lacks strong engagement.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (4)**: Slightly agreeable—prevention messaging can be attention-grabbing, especially for someone who values health.
- **I believe the ad is good. (5)**: Agree; it effectively highlights a common concern about fatigue and appearance.
- **I find the ad attractive. (2)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly disagree; while functional, there's room for more creativity or personal connection to make it truly appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (1)**: Strongly disagree—current health routines don't require a new drink.
- **I will try to buy this product. (2)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly agree; open-mindedness for potential trial, given the current state of well-being and interest in preventive measures.
- **I will consider buying this product. (3)**: Agree—although not an immediate priority, I'm likely to weigh it against other alternatives when feeling more tired or looking for new wellness options.

In summary, while finding some value in its messaging and being open to considering the product under certain circumstances, my overall attitude is mildly positive but not strongly compelling enough for a purchase intent. The ad resonates well with preventive health values without overly influencing immediate buying behavior.
