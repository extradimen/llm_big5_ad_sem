**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad**: Moderately agree due to its relevance and clear messaging but not strongly since it might not capture my full attention.
   - **Interesting**: Strongly agree as I appreciate how energizing aspects are highlighted, appealing for daily functionality.
   - **Good**: Highly positive about the presentation of benefits (health & appearance) which align with modern concerns in Southeast Asia.
   - **Attractive**: Mild agreement; while visually and conceptually engaging, it falls short on personal appeal given my preference for more detailed, evidence-based claims.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Moderate intent due to balanced mix of perceived benefits but need further research or brand trust.
   - **Try to buy**: Strong consideration because the promise resonates with maintaining health and appearance, essential aspects in my lifestyle.
   - **Consider buying**: Highly considering; although I'm not immediately sold by the ad alone, it sparks interest enough for me to seek more information before making a decision.

Overall, while not entirely swayed by the advertising style, the message is sufficiently compelling to warrant further investigation and potential purchase based on substantiated claims. Balance between product efficacy and personal values will guide my final buying decision.
