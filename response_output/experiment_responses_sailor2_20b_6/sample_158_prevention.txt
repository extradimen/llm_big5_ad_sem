**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad.**: 5 - Although persuasive in its message, it doesn't resonate strongly enough due to its somewhat generic appeal.
  - **I think the ad is interesting.**: 4 - It's mildly engaging but lacks creativity or novelty that would make me highly interested.
  - **I believe the ad is good.**: 6 - The concept of preventing fatigue and dull appearance has a solid foundation, making it generally credible.
  - **I find the ad attractive.**: 3 - While not unattractive, its straightforward approach doesn't grab my attention enough to consider it visually or emotionally compelling.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **I intend to purchase this product.**: 2 - The advertisementâ€™s appeal is weak in convincing me for an immediate buy.
  - **I will try to buy this product.**: 1 - No strong drive to act on the ad and actually make a trial purchase.
  - **I will consider buying this product.**: 3 - It does leave some room for consideration, but other factors (like personal habits or brand preference) would also play significant roles in my decision-making.

Overall, while I recognize the effectiveness of the ad's message in theory, it falls short on excitement and immediate action motivation given my personality traits and preferences. Therefore, moderate interest without strong purchase intention is reflected here.
