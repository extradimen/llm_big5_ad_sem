**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: **3**: Neutral): It doesn't grab my attention strongly but is decently appealing.
  - The ad is interesting (Score: **4**: Slightly Agree): The concept of energy and appearance seems relevant, though it’s not groundbreaking.
  - Belief in the ad's goodness (Score: **2**: Disagree): Feels somewhat overgeneralized; I prefer more specific health claims.
  - Attractiveness (Score: **5**: Neutral leaning toward Agree): Visually appealing but lacks a strong emotional connection for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (Score: **1**: Strongly Disagree): Despite the ad, I don’t see myself buying it immediately due to budget constraints and lack of urgency.
  - Will try to buy this product (Score: **2**: Slightly Agree): It’s slightly more appealing if others recommend or offer deals, but not a priority purchase.
  - Consider buying in future (Score: **3**: Neutral leaning toward Disagree): I’ll keep an open mind about it but won’t prioritize over other essential needs. 

Overall, the ad resonates on some level with its preventive theme and general appeal, but my personal values and current financial situation make me cautious about actually purchasing this product now.
