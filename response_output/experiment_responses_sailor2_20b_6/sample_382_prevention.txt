**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging.
   - **Interest Level:** Agree (4) – It captures my attention due to its clear benefit of combating tiredness and looking dull, which are real concerns for daily life.
   - **Good Quality Ad:** Strongly agree (5) – The ad seems credible; it presents a legitimate issue that resonates with maintaining personal appearance and energy levels.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – While informative, the appeal is practical rather than visually or emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Agree (4) – The perceived benefits align with my needs for staying active and presentable throughout the day.
   - **Try to buy:** Agree (4) – I might give it a try since the ad highlights a common problem that affects everyone, including myself.
   - **Consider buying:** Strongly agree (6) – Given its relevance, reasonable pricing within my budget range (~250,000–380,000 VND/month if priced moderately), and trust in advertising content, I am inclined to consider this product as part of my routine.

**Summary:**
The advertisement is effective at highlighting a tangible benefit that appeals to me. While it may not be the most attractive visually or emotionally, its practicality resonates well with someone prioritizing daily energy and appearance like myself. Consequently, though moderately interested in liking the ad itself, I am strongly considering purchasing this product due to its potential real-world impact on my lifestyle.
