**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **Like (4):** The ad piques curiosity but doesn't deeply resonate due to my cautious personality and preference for practicality over dramatization.
  - **Interesting (5):** It does hold some appeal in highlighting potential fatigue issues, given the busy managerial role I've had.
  - **Good (3):** While conceptually sound, it lacks a compelling emotional connection or proof of effectiveness.
  - **Attractive (2):** The promise seems generic and fails to align strongly with my values; not persuasive enough visually or emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (1):** Despite understanding the fatigue issue, there's no strong incentive from the ad. 
  - **Try (2):** I might consider sampling if offered a trial, but low confidence in its effectiveness.
  - **Consider (1):** Overall, my skepticism and practical nature steer me away from making an immediate purchase based solely on this advertisement.

These scores reflect a mix of interest and caution, aligning with both the persuasive limitations of the ad and my personal traits.
