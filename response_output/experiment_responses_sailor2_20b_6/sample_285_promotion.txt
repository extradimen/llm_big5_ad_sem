**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (3) — Despite being talkative and outgoing, I don't feel a strong emotional connection but am open.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4) — The promise of staying energized is intriguing for an office worker.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5) — It aligns with my desire to look and perform better daily.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (2) — Overwhelming claims lack credibility, making it less visually appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend**: Considerable but not strong intention (3) — The ad is persuasive enough to consider the product without committing immediately.
   - **Try**: Might try, given the right situation (4) — If there are discounts or recommendations from trusted sources.
   - **Consider**: High consideration due to innovative appeal and personal drive for energy (6) — Strong inclination based on my preference for new ideas and daily performance enhancement.
