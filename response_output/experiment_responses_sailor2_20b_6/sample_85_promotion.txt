**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): Neutral leaning towards slight dislike. As a reserved individual who values practicality over flashy promotions, it doesn't resonate personally.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): Mildly agreeable; while not gripping, it's mildly engaging.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5): Somewhat positive due to its claim of health benefits and appearance improvement, but lacks strong personal appeal.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Strongly disagree. It feels too superficial for my preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; doesn't align with my current needs or budget priorities as a blue-collar worker.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 1): Also strongly disagree. No compelling reason to change existing consumption habits.
  - I will consider buying it (Score: 2): Slightly agree, open to exploring the benefits but not actively inclined; might entertain it under specific circumstances or discounts.

Overall, while acknowledging its marketing merits, my reserved nature and practical lifestyle make this ad less persuasive for a purchase.
