**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - Like (3): The ad isn't strongly appealing but doesn't turn me off either.
  - Interesting (4): It piques my interest to some extent; the claim feels relevant.
  - Good (2): While not bad, it lacks strong persuasiveness or emotional connection for me personally.
  - Attractive (3): Neutral attractiveness—doesn’t stand out but isn't unattractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree. Given my budget constraints and cautious nature, I'm unlikely to commit right away without more compelling reasons or a need.
  - Try to buy this product (2): Neutral leaning towards agree; might give it a try if highly recommended by someone trustworthy.
  - Consider buying this product (2): Slightly agree—understandable for preventing fatigue and dullness, but not high priority in my current situation.

Overall, the ad is okay but lacks enough emotional connection or urgency to drive immediate purchase intent. Practicality and budget awareness weigh more heavily on me right now.
