**Explanation:**

**Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (Score 4)** - I find it somewhat pleasant but not particularly engaging.
2. **Interesting (Score 5)** - It catches my attention due to its straightforward message, though nothing groundbreaking.
3. **Good (Score 3)** - The ad claims effectively convey a need for the product but lacks emotional depth or compelling evidence.
4. **Attractive (Score 2)** - Personally, I don't find it visually or conceptually attractive; it feels somewhat generic.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score 1)** - Strongly disagree – Despite recognizing a need for energy and alertness, other factors like price, lifestyle preferences, and brand loyalty are more important.
2. **Try to Buy (Score 2)** - Neutral leaning towards disagreement – I might give it a shot if recommended by someone trusted but not on my own initiative.
3. **Consider Buying (Score 3)** – Agree: The ad prompts mild consideration due to the potential benefits, though further information and context would be necessary before making an actual purchase decision.

Overall, while there is some acknowledgment of the need addressed in the advertisement, it does not strongly influence immediate or planned purchasing behavior given my personal traits and current situation. Credibility and emotional connection are lacking for a compelling buy-in.
