**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 4)
   - Neutral leaning towards positive since it's a well-constructed preventative message but not particularly engaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 5)
   - Somewhat interested, as the premise of feeling tired and looking dull resonates with general fatigue issues.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 6)
   - Agreed that it's effectively highlighting a common problem but could be more compelling in execution.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3)
   - Less attracted due to its simplicity and potential lack of visual appeal or emotional depth for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) 
   - Not a strong intention; more cautious and skeptical about immediate purchases.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3)
   - Slightly inclined to give it a shot, considering its relevance but not urgent.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 4)
   - Open to the idea of trying if there's more information available or positive reviews from friends/colleagues.

Overall, while I find some aspects intriguing and potentially useful, my reserved nature combined with a cautious mindset means that immediate purchase intent is moderate. The ad succeeds in raising awareness but lacks enough emotional connection or compelling proof for an instant buy.
