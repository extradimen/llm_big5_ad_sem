**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3). The content is acceptable but not particularly engaging for me.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4). It does catch my attention, especially mentioning energy and appearance benefits.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5). I appreciate clear health/fitness messaging; it aligns with personal wellness goals.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2). While the concept is good, visual appeal or specific details are lacking to make me feel strongly drawn.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Agree (4). I recognize the benefits but am not fully committed without more context or experience.
   - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Agree (5). Will give it a try if available and within budget, given its claimed advantages.
   - **Consider Buying:** Very Likely to Consider (6). High potential for consideration; meets needs but requires further information and perhaps discounts.

Overall, the ad resonates with my values of staying energized and looking good, making it persuasive enough to encourage trial or future purchase. However, stronger visual appeal and more detailed product info would enhance its attractiveness significantly.
