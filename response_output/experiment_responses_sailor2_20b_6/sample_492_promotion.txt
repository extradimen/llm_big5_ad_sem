**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad (score: 5):**
   - While I appreciate being shown a product that claims to boost energy and appearance, it doesn't resonate as strongly with my reserved nature.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 4):**
   - It's engaging enough given its straightforward message but lacks depth or unique appeal for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 6):**
   - I find it credible, especially since staying energized and looking good are desirable outcomes, aligning with general health consciousness.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3):**
   - The visual appeal might be average; it doesn't captivate me due to my tendency toward practicality over flashy presentations.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2):**
   - Low intention since I'm not currently in a period of life where new health supplements are a priority, and there isnâ€™t enough personal motivation based on the ad alone.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 3):**
   - A bit more likely if recommended by someone trusted or during special offers that align with my budget.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 4):**
   - Given my helpful and unselfish nature, I might think about it for friends/family needing energy boosters, so consideration remains moderate but not high-priority personally.

Overall, the ad is decently persuasive due to its clear benefits, yet personal preferences lean towards practicality and careful decision-making rather than impulsive purchases. Thus, while positive attitudes are present, immediate or strong purchase intentions are minimal for someone in my demographic profile.
