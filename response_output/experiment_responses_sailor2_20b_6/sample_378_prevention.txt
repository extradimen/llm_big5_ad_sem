**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) - While it catches attention with its health-related message, my personality traits and current priorities don't make me particularly fond of the ad.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) - The appeal to avoiding tiredness and dull appearance piques interest but doesn’t captivate deeply.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (5) – It effectively communicates a clear benefit, which aligns with general preventive health messages that I generally find valuable.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2) - Despite its informative content, my preference for vivid, engaging ads and sometimes lack of enthusiasm make it less visually or emotionally appealing to me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Given that I am a high school student with other priorities like studies and social activities, buying this particular drink isn't currently on my agenda.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree (2) - The ad doesn’t provoke immediate action or interest strong enough for me to actively seek it out.
3. **Will consider buying the product:** Neutral (3) – Although I recognize its benefits, without a compelling personal need right now, consideration is minimal but not entirely ruled out.

Overall, while appreciating the message and potential usefulness of the drink, my current lifestyle, priorities, and personality preferences don't drive strong intent to purchase. Thus, both ad attitude scores and purchase intentions reflect moderate engagement rather than enthusiasm or immediate action.
