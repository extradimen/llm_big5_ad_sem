**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - *I like the ad.* – Neutral (4): While it's not disliked, I don't find it particularly engaging.
  - *Interesting* – Agree (5): The idea of staying energized and looking good is intriguing for a busy young professional.
  - *Believe the ad is good* – Slightly Agree (3): It sounds generic; more specific benefits would enhance credibility.
  - *Attractive* – Disagree (2): Lacks personalized appeal, especially given my tendencies to be talkative yet somewhat carefree.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* – Strongly Disagree (1): Despite its promise, there's not enough convincing evidence for immediate action.
  - *Will try to buy the product.* – Strongly Disagree (2): The lack of compelling detail makes me hesitant to invest time or money.
  - *Consider buying* – Strongly Disagree (2): While conceptually appealing, my current priorities and financial constraints overshadow this consideration.

Overall, while intrigued by its benefits, the ad falls short in credibility and personalized appeal for a decisive purchase intent.
