**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) - The message is straightforward but lacks personal appeal given my reserved nature.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Disagree (2) - It's too generic and doesn't capture attention effectively for someone who values originality over common assertions.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Agree (4) - As a blue-collar worker, I appreciate its practical claim about fatigue relief, which resonates with my daily experience.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral (3) - It's functional but not visually or emotionally engaging enough for someone who has few artistic interests.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Agree (5) - The health and energy benefits are crucial, especially with my demanding job.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Strongly Agree (6) - Given its clear preventive claim against tiredness, I'm motivated to give it a shot.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Strongly Agree (7) - Despite not being thrilled by the ad itself, the potential benefit aligns with my need for sustained energy and productivity.

Overall, while the advertisement is functional in addressing practical needs, its execution leaves room for improvement regarding personal appeal. However, the promise of improved physical condition makes it a compelling purchase consideration.
