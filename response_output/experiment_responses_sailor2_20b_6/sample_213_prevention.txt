**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (score = 4)**:
   - Neutral but leaning towards agreeable due to its potential relevance for feeling more energized and presentable.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 3)**:
   - Slightly positive; the claim about fatigue and appearance connects with everyday concerns, making it moderately engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)**:
   - Agreeable; effective messaging around health and appearance can be seen as valuable information.
  
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)**:
   - Disagree: While informative, the aesthetics or emotional pull might not strongly attract me.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 4)**:
   - Neutral leaning slightly towards agreement; potential health benefits may prompt consideration but don't guarantee immediate action.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 3)**:
   - Somewhat positive; willing to consider a trial, influenced by the need for energy and appearance improvement.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 2)**:
   - Slightly agree: The ad encourages thoughtfulness about the benefits, but other factors (budget, existing routines) might influence the final decision.

In summary, while I appreciate the relevance of the message to health and vitality concerns, my inclination towards practicality and careful planning leads me to be cautiously positive rather than strongly motivated. The balance between informational value and personal engagement results in moderate scores for both ad attitude and purchase intention.
