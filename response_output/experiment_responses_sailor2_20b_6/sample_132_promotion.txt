**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad (Score = 4):**
   - Neutral to Positive; While I find it engaging due to its emphasis on energy and appearance, my generally talkative and outgoing nature doesn't strongly draw me in.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 3):**
   - Slightly Agree; It's somewhat intriguing but lacks a compelling narrative or personal relevance for someone with daily blue-collar work responsibilities.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):** 
   - Agree; The message about staying energized and looking best aligns well conceptually, though it feels generic rather than tailor-made for my demographic concerns.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2):**
   - Disagree; It's not particularly visually or emotionally appealing given my focus on practicality over aesthetics.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** 
   - Strongly Disagree; The high cost and other daily priorities mean I lack the immediate intent despite its benefits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1):**
   - Strongly Disagree; Given my budget constraints (monthly income between 26–35 million VND), trying it out isn’t feasible.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 2):** 
   - Slightly Agree; While not a strong consideration, the idea of feeling more energized and presentable might warrant brief thought if circumstances improve financially or I encounter specific promotional deals.

Overall, while acknowledging its potentially beneficial claims, practical constraints and personal priorities render my immediate purchase intentions low. The ad is seen as good but fails to drive significant action due to budgetary limitations and non-urgent needs.
