**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (Score 3)*: While not strongly positive, the appeal is neutral given my talkative nature and generally agreeable demeanor towards advertisements with health-focused messages.
   - *Interesting (Score 4)*: The concept of fatigue prevention aligns well with my daily experiences; thus, it holds some interest but not overwhelmingly so.
   - *Good (Score 5)*: It feels credible due to the strong emphasis on avoiding tiredness and looking dull—resonates with maintaining personal appearance and energy levels at work.
   - *Attractive (Score 2)*: The overall visual appeal or design might need improvement; as an office worker, I tend towards subtler yet effective messaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (Score 2)*: Although the ad addresses my daily concerns about fatigue, there's no strong enough personal connection or immediate necessity driving a purchase decision.
   - *Try to Buy (Score 3)*: There’s some curiosity to test if this product can indeed make a difference in how I feel and look. Given my cautious nature towards trying new health drinks, it rates moderately higher than intent.
   - *Consider Buying (Score 4)*: The combination of the message's relevance and reasonable pricing would lead me to weigh options further, possibly during periods when fatigue feels particularly burdensome.

In summary, while appreciative of the ad’s focus on a real concern, I am not yet fully convinced or compelled enough to immediately buy the product. More information about efficacy, side effects, and customer testimonials could sway my decision positively.
