**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3/7):** While not strongly favorable, I appreciate the message but find it somewhat generic.
  - **Interesting (4/7):** The ad sparks a bit of interest due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  - **Good (5/7):** It feels decently crafted with clear goals; however, I'm neutral on its overall quality.
  - **Attractive (3/7):** Not particularly appealing given my tendency towards strong agreement in practicality over aesthetics.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Slightly inclined but not strongly driven due to the need for more compelling evidence of effectiveness (2/7).
  - **Will try to buy:** There's a moderate intention to give it a trial, especially considering my high expectations for thorough performance and health benefits (3/7).
  - **Consider buying:** Open-minded about incorporating this into my routine; practicality balances with the potential positive impacts on daily energy and appearance (4/7).

In summary, while I appreciate aspects of the ad's message, it falls short in terms of strong attraction. The purchase intention is moderately favorable due to personal values around efficiency and wellness but lacks a decisive push toward immediate action.
