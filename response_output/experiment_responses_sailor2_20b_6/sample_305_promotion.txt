**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 4): While not strongly positive, it appeals slightly due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3): It's mildly engaging but doesn't capture my attention deeply given other priorities in my life.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 2): The claims seem generic rather than compelling, lacking specific evidence or uniqueness that resonates with me personally.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Neutral visual appeal; it does not stand out enough to be memorable.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. My current lifestyle and limited budget don't justify spending on an unproven energy drink.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 1): No intention of trying it, as my daily needs are met adequately with existing habits.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 1): Given the low value perceived and limited financial resources, there's no reason for me to even ponder purchasing it.

Overall, while acknowledging its presence, the advertisement does not align well with my reserved nature, budget constraints, or sense of practicality. Therefore, a very low score reflects both my attitude toward the ad and lack of interest in making any purchase intention based on this promotion.
