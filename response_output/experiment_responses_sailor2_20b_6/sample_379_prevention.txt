**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral leaning towards slight positive (scored as 4).
   - The claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates to a degree but is not overly compelling.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agreed moderately (5). 
   - It addresses common concerns, making it relevant enough to capture interest briefly.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Lean toward positive (6).
   - The message is straightforward and relatable for someone managing daily fatigue.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly below average (3).
   - While not unappealing, its design might need more creativity to stand out from competitors.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral leaning low (2).
   - Though understanding the problem, a firm intention isn't there without additional proof or personal experience with similar products.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Somewhat inclined but not decisive (3).
   - Curiosity is piqued enough for an initial trial, especially if the price and availability are reasonable.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Open-minded consideration (4).
   - The ad makes it onto my radar; I'd weigh feedback from others or future promotions before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while the advertisement is moderately engaging and somewhat persuasive due to its relevance, stronger emotional connection or more compelling benefits would drive higher scores. My cautious nature and balanced approach suggest potential interest without immediate commitment.
