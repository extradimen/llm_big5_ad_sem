**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 2 - Disagree)  
   Given my reserved and sometimes careless nature, I find the claim too broad and exaggerated to resonate personally.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4 - Neutral with slight agreement)
   The concept of feeling tired without the drink piques mild interest due to its relatability but lacks strong engagement.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 3 - Slight Disagreement)  
   My generally untrusting nature makes me question whether this drink truly prevents fatigue, so I don't fully buy into it.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 5 - Agree)
   While not overly persuasive, its simplicity and straightforward messaging has an appealing minimalistic quality for practicality-seekers like myself.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)  
   Despite some interest in staying alert, the ad lacks credibility convincing me of immediate necessity or long-term benefits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3 - Neutral with slight intention)
   There's a bit of curiosity driven by my active imagination and occasional need for energy boosts; however, itâ€™s not compelling enough.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2 - Disagree)  
   Given my financial constraints (<15 million VND/month), I'm more cautious about spending on products that are just claims without substantial proof of effectiveness or value for money.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat interesting and mildly attractive due to its practical nature, it falls short in credibility and strong persuasive power. Thus, purchase intentions remain low despite a small glimmer of curiosity.
