**Explanation:**

- **Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
  - *Like (4)*: Although I value energy and looking good, I am slightly reserved; hence, it's a moderate positive reaction.
  - *Interesting (5)*: The promise of staying energized is intriguing but not overwhelmingly compelling for me.
  - *Good (6)*: The message aligns with my values, making the ad seem reasonably well-crafted and credible.
  - *Attractive (3)*: It's somewhat appealing visually or conceptually but doesn't evoke strong emotional response due to personal reserve.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend (2)*: I'm not highly motivated; my reserved nature means it takes more than just an ad to make a purchase decision.
  - *Try (1.5)*: There’s slight curiosity, but it wouldn't be top priority given other commitments and limited budget consciousness.
  - *Consider (2.5)*: It's on the list of options I'll ponder if the situation aligns with my needs—like having a hectic day or needing an energy boost.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately well due to its appealing message, personal traits like being reserved and focusing more on thoroughness rather than immediate impulsivity lower the intent towards direct purchase.
