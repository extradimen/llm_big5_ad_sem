**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Score of `3` (Disagree)
   - Being reserved and sometimes rude, I find the direct warning tone less appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score of `4` (Neutral to Agree)
   - The fear appeal might catch my attention but doesn't excite me strongly due to my emotional stability.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score of `5` (Agree) 
   - While I'm not convinced by its direct approach, it presents a clear message about fatigue and appearance that resonates somewhat as credible.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score of `2` (Strongly Disagree)
   - The lackluster presentation style doesn't align with my preference for originality and creativity, making it unattractive to me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of `1` (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my tendencies towards being careless and not thoroughly planning purchases, I lack the strong motivation required.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score of `2` (Disagree)
   - Although slightly piqued by the prevention aspect, it doesn't compel me enough to actively seek out or test the drink.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score of `3` (Neutral leaning towards Agree)
   - There's a marginal consideration due to its relevance in managing energy levels but not sufficient for immediate action given my cautious attitude and high threshold for trust.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad's effectiveness in conveying potential drawbacks without the drink, it falls short on appealing to me personally both emotionally and behaviorally. My purchase intention remains low despite understanding its functional benefit.
