**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (score = 5)**: While I appreciate the message of staying energized and looking good, it feels a bit generic without specific details that resonate strongly with my personality.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**: The concept is standard in health/beauty ads but doesn't captivate me due to lack of innovative angles or emotional connection.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 3)**: It meets basic expectations, but it could benefit from more trust-building elements considering my strong skepticism and lack of general trust traits.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)**: The visual appeal might work for some, but its overall presentation doesn't align well with my preferences; I tend to be critical rather than easily swayed by aesthetics alone.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 2)**: Despite being interested in the benefits mentioned, there's insufficient compelling reason or proof of effectiveness that would prompt an immediate buy decision given my cautious and occasionally skeptical nature.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (score = 1)**: I'm not inclined to go out of my way to purchase based on such a generic ad; more targeted information about efficacy, reviews, or personal endorsements are needed.

3. **Consider buying the product (score = 3)**: It will be in consideration for future needs, especially if presented with strong supporting evidence and aligned with healthy lifestyle goals I value highly.

In summary, while open to the idea, further specific assurances and personalized appeal would significantly improve my overall attitude towards the ad and increase my purchase intent.
