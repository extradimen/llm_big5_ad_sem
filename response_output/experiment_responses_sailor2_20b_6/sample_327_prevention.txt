**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **I like the ad (4)**: I appreciate its straightforward message but find it slightly generic.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (5)**: It's engaging due to the clear focus on health and appearance, making me stop for a moment.
   - **I believe the ad is good (6)**: The prevention aspect aligns with my proactive nature in managing energy levels and personal well-being.
   - **I find the ad attractive (3)**: While not extremely visually appealing or compelling, it does convey necessity and concern effectively.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2)**: The appeal is there but no immediate urgency; I'd consider my usual routine.
   - **Will try to buy this product (3)**: There's a cautious optimism in trying, especially if aligned with past experiences and reviews.
   - **Will consider buying the product (4)**: It falls within my budget range and matches some of my health goals, so itâ€™s on the list for future consideration.

Overall, while I appreciate its messaging, factors like personal routine stability and careful decision-making keep me from strong immediate intent. The ad is effective enough to prompt thought but not an instant buy.
