**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score = 2) – Given my introverted nature and tendency to be less trusting of promotions, I find it hard to connect with generic feel-good ads.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral leaning slightly Agree (Score = 3) – The concept of staying energized is appealing but not groundbreaking enough to capture sustained interest.
   - **Good:** Disagree-leaning Neutral (Score = 4) – While functional benefits are presented, the message feels somewhat hollow without specific proof or relatable experiences for my demographic.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (Score = 3) – The promise of looking good can appeal on a surface level, but it doesn’t deeply resonate with me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Disagree (Score = 2) – Despite the benefits, my cautious nature and low inclination for new products without solid recommendations or evidence mean I'm not likely to buy impulsively.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Neutral leaning Agree (Score = 3) – If given a discount or bundled with another purchase I need, there might be some incentive.
   - **Consider buying the product:** Agree (Score = 4) – There’s potential consideration based on personal needs for energy and appearance improvement; though not strong enough to drive immediate action.

Overall, while I appreciate the general appeal, my reserved nature and lack of trust make this ad less compelling. However, a strategic discount or recommendation might sway me towards considering it.
