**Evaluation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (3)**:
   - The claim to prevent tiredness and dull looks is somewhat appealing but not enough to make me strongly positive.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (4)**:
   - It's moderately engaging, focusing on common daily issues; however, it lacks creativity or novelty for my taste.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2)**:
   - The message seems straightforward but could be more compelling with stronger evidence or relatable scenarios to truly convince me.

4. **I find the ad attractive (1)**:
   - It feels somewhat generic and uninspired, not aligning strongly with my taste for substance over presentation.

### Purchase Intention

1. **Intend to purchase this product (5)**:
   - Slightly leaning towards considering it due to its apparent benefits against fatigue but no urgent need yet.

2. **Will try to buy the product (6)**:
   - Curiosity is piqued, and with my helpful nature, I might give it a shot if reviews or recommendations are favorable.

3. **Will consider buying this product (7)**:
   - Despite reservations about its presentation, potential long-term benefits align somewhat with my values of thoroughness and preventive health measures, making me highly open to considering the purchase eventually. 

Overall, while the ad doesn't fully resonate emotionally due to being underwhelming in creativity, I'm still willing to evaluate it further based on efficacy claims and user feedback.
