**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (4):** The language is persuasive but not overly dramatic for my tastes.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (5):** It does highlight a common concern about energy and appearance, making it relevant to daily experiences.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (6):** While effective in conveying urgency, its focus on potential consequences aligns with how I perceive self-care products generally being beneficial.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (3):** The appeal isn't overly strong; it lacks a unique or compelling visual hook for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (2):** Neutral leaning towards disinterest due to existing routines and skepticism without further proof of effectiveness.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (1):** Low likelihood as I prefer more researched or trusted options for energy drinks.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (2):** Mild consideration because it addresses common issues, but not enough to prioritize a purchase immediately.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately in terms of interest and believability but falls short on immediate intent due to personal habits and cautious nature towards new products.
