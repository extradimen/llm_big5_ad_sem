**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Scores):**
  - *Like*: **3** — Neutral. The ad's message is clear but doesn't particularly appeal to me.
  - *Interesting*: **4** — Agree slightly. It has a straightforward yet effective hook, so it piques curiosity briefly.
  - *Good*: **5** — Agree more than neutral. The focus on vitality resonates with health awareness, though not strongly enough for high enthusiasm.
  - *Attractive*: **2** — Disagree somewhat. While the message is relevant, its presentation lacks emotional depth or compelling imagery.

- **Purchase Intention (Scores):**
  - *Intend to purchase this product*: **1** — Strongly disagree. Given my current budget constraints and lack of strong appeal from the ad, it's unlikely I will buy impulsively.
  - *Try to buy this product*: **2** — Slightly agree. If I were feeling particularly tired or saw a good discount/promotion, I might give it a trial purchase.
  - *Consider buying this product*: **3** — Neutral. The ad triggers some thought but doesn't drive immediate action; consideration depends on further circumstances (e.g., need/availability).

Overall, the advertisement targets my health-conscious nature well enough to be moderately considered, yet it falls short in generating strong intent or emotional connection due to its straightforward presentation and lack of personal resonance with my reserved personality. The financial aspect also influences a cautious approach toward buying impulsively.
