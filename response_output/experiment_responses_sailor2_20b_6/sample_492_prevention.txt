**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **Like the Ad (4/7):** The message about feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat relatable but not enough to strongly engage me.
    - **Interesting (3/7):** While it addresses a common issue, the presentation doesn't captivate my attention as an outgoing, talkative individual.
    - **Good Advertisement (2/7):** I believe some claims might be overemphasized; lacks convincing credibility and emotional appeal for someone who values thoroughness.
    - **Attractive Ad (1/7):** The ad feels manipulative rather than appealing. As a reserved person, it's too pushy to seem genuinely attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1). I have trust but not enough conviction based on the advertisement alone.
    - **Try to Buy:** Neutral/Disagree (1). No immediate urge or curiosity despite addressing a potential need.
    - **Consider Buying:** Mild Consideration (1). There's some base-level awareness, but additional information and personal assessment would be necessary before making any purchase decision.

Overall, while the ad taps into a relevant concern, it doesn't effectively leverage my talkative nature nor evoke strong trust or emotional engagement for an immediate purchasing action. Thus, low scores reflect its weak persuasiveness in influencing actual purchases.
