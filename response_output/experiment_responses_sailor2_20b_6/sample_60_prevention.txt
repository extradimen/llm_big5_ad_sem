**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (6):** It aligns with my desire to avoid fatigue and maintain a vibrant appearance. However, it could be more compelling.
  - **Interesting (5):** The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging for someone who values variety in content.
  - **Good (4):** While factually relevant, the simplicity lacks depth or creativity that might appeal more strongly to my preferences.
  - **Attractive (3):** It's functional and believable, yet I feel a lack of emotional connection due to its generic nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (2):** The ad resonates with the need but not enough to drive immediate intent. Other factors like pricing or brand familiarity are more critical.
  - **Will try to buy this product (1):** Low likelihood due to neutral feelings and limited incentive beyond basic functionality.
  - **Consider buying this product (2):** Slightly higher than "intend" because I am open to its benefits but won't prioritize it without further exploration or promotion.

Overall, the ad is moderately effective in conveying usefulness yet falls short of compelling me as a talkative, outgoing office worker who values thoroughness and planning. It needs more emotional appeal or distinctive features to significantly influence my purchase behavior.
