**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3)
   - The concept of preventing fatigue and dullness is somewhat appealing but not strongly so.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score = 4)
   - It sparks curiosity about a product that claims to enhance daily performance, making it mildly engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral with slight inclination towards Disagree (Score = 3)
   - The message seems straightforward but lacks compelling evidence or emotional connection for strong belief in its quality.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly Negative (Score = 2)
   - My outgoing nature helps me appreciate simple, to-the-point ads; however, it doesn’t particularly stand out due to a lack of originality and creativity.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1)
   - Despite understanding its benefits, my tendency towards being careless and not fully committed makes me highly unlikely to make an immediate buy decision based on this ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral with slight Agree (Score = 2)
   - There's a mild curiosity but the lack of thoroughness in planning means I'm unlikely to actively seek it out without more persuasion or necessity.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree leaning towards Neutral (Score = 3)
   - While not ruling it out completely, my emotional stability and general trust with external benefits mean I might keep an open mind but won't prioritize a purchase at the moment.

Overall, though the ad has some merit in communicating its purpose effectively, it doesn’t resonate strongly enough to drive immediate or consistent purchasing behavior for someone like myself. Further marketing efforts focusing on personal relevance or additional proof could improve these scores.
