**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Disagree (score = 3)
  - Being somewhat reserved and practical, I find it hard to get excited about such generalized energy drink claims.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Neutral (score = 2)
  - The promise of staying energized might seem basic; it doesn't stand out enough given my daily routine challenges.

- **I believe the ad is good:** Agree-ish (score = 4)
  - While I appreciate being shown a product that offers health benefits, it feels more generic than genuinely compelling.
  
- **I find the ad attractive:** Somewhat Neutral to Disagree (score = 3)
  - The aesthetic and messaging don't strike me as particularly appealing or distinctive.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1)
  - My budget constraints and reliance on tried-and-tested solutions make it unlikely I'd spend money without more concrete benefits.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat Considered but Low Intent (score = 2)
  - The low monthly income means any purchase needs careful consideration, so trying out a new energy drink is quite speculative.

- **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree (score = 1)
  - Given my limited funds and the lack of personal relevance in the ad's claims, I'm unlikely to include it as an option for future purchases. 

Overall, while recognizing its potential benefits, practicality and financial realities steer me away from high engagement with the advertisement or immediate purchase intent.
