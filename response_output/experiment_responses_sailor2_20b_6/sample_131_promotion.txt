**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad:** Score of 4 (Agree) — I find it somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Score of 5 (Strongly Agree) — The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing to me, particularly after my daily labor-intensive work.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Score of 3 (Neutral) — It hits on some positive points but lacks compelling evidence or specific details that would make it truly stand out for me.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Score of 2 (Disagree) — The presentation feels somewhat generic and not personalized enough to strongly captivate my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Despite some interest, there's no immediate need or strong personal connection that would drive a purchase.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Score of 2 (Disagree) — While I might consider it, the lack of trust in quick promises and my usual caution outweigh any curiosity.
- **I will consider buying this product:** Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Given my limited disposable income range ($26M–$35M VND), other essential needs take priority over a potentially temporary energy boost.

In summary, while the ad captures some aspects that resonate with me (interest in staying energized and looking good), it falls short on personal appeal, credibility, and alignment with my financial constraints. As such, I am unlikely to convert this interest into an actual purchase decision.
