- **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (5) - From an objective standpoint, promoting well-being and appearance improvement has positive societal value.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2) - Despite liking its message, my reserved personality finds the advertisement's aesthetic or emotional appeal lacking.

**Purchase Intention Scores Explanation:**
- **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - My preference for helpful and unselfish actions means I prioritize practical needs of family over personal indulgences.
- **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree (2) - While the benefits are appealing, my current budget constraints and focus on necessities make it less likely.
