**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Like the Ad (6):**
   - As a talkative and sociable civil servant with an active imagination, I appreciate energetic slogans that match my dynamic lifestyle. The promise of staying energized aligns well with my outgoing nature.

2. **Interesting (5):**
   - The concept is appealing to someone who values staying alert and looking their best every day, which resonates on a personal level without being overly gimmicky.

3. **Good (Neutral 4):**
   - While the message hits some key points about energy and appearance, it doesn't convince me entirely due to generic claims that could be common in many ads of this type, lacking unique selling propositions or strong evidence supporting its efficacy.

4. **Attractive (Disagree 3):**
   - The ad feels somewhat superficial for someone who is generally not swayed by looks alone and prefers more substantiated promotional content. I look for credible benefits supported by facts rather than just appearance enhancement promises.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase (2)**:
   - Although the message appeals, it doesn't compel a strong purchase intent without further details on ingredients, health claims, or personal reviews from trusted sources.

2. **Will Try to Buy (3)**:
   - There's curiosity driven by the adâ€™s promises but hesitation due to typical generic marketing tactics and lack of deep engagement with potential benefits beyond superficial appeal.

3. **Consider Buying (4)**:
   - The overall score reflects a cautious yet open consideration, indicating that while not strongly motivated, I would weigh additional information or experiences from peers before making an informed decision.

In summary, the ad is positively received due to its alignment with my personal values and lifestyle but falls short in compelling immediate action without more concrete details. Hence, it earns moderate scores across both attitude and purchase intention metrics.
