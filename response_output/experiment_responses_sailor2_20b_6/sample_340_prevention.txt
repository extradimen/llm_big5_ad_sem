**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* (5/7): Neutral. The claim feels somewhat compelling but doesn't fully resonate due to personal experiences and skepticism about instant solutions.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (6/7): Agree. It grabs attention by highlighting negative consequences, making it engaging in a preventive manner.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (4/7): Somewhat Agree. The messaging is clear but lacks strong credibility for my situation and preferences.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (3/7): Disagree. While attention-grabbing, its overemphasis on quick fixes feels a bit too manipulative to be genuinely appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* (2/7): Slightly Disagree. The message is persuasive but not enough for immediate action; other factors like cost and consistency are important.
  - *Will try to buy this product.* (3/7): Disagree. Despite being interested, I'm cautious about new products without thorough research or reviews from trusted sources.
  - *Consider buying the product.* (1/7): Strongly Disagree. Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income), other priorities take precedence and this purchase doesn't align with immediate needs.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's creativity and preventative approach, it falls short in inspiring a strong intent to buy due to personal skepticism about its efficacy and economic considerations.
