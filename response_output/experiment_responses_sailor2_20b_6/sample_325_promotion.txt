**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
   - **Like:** 4 (Agree) – Despite being talkative and generally trusting, the ad's messaging resonates moderately.
   - **Interesting:** 3 (Neutral to Agree) – The energy boost claim is somewhat appealing but not exceptionally novel for me as an office worker with a routine life.
   - **Good:** 5 (Strongly Agree) – I appreciate wellness-focused products that aim to help daily performance and appearance, making it seem beneficial overall.
   - **Attractive:** 2 (Disagree) – Given my reserved nature and limited interest in flashy marketing, the ad feels more utilitarian than attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** 3 (Neutral) – While I recognize its value, personal financial constraints (monthly income <15M VND) make a firm commitment uncertain.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** 3 (Neutral) – There's some consideration but not immediate action due to budget limitations and cautious nature.
   - **Will Consider Buying:** 4 (Agree) – The benefits align with my needs for staying energized, so it warrants serious thought before deciding.

Overall, the ad has a moderate positive impact on me, appealing enough to consider its usefulness without being an instant buy. Practicality meets reservation in this evaluation process.
