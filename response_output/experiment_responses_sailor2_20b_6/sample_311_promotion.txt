**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) — The energetic and beauty aspects appeal to me but not strongly enough.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (5) — It's engaging, especially with visuals of people looking vibrant.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (6) — Clear messaging about energy and appearance resonates positively.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (3) — I appreciate its intent but don't feel visually drawn to it personally.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Somewhat disagree)
     - While appealing, my reserved nature and current financial constraints make a strong intention less likely.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Consider (3)
     - It's worth considering as an occasional treat for its promised benefits but not essential right now.
   - **Will consider buying this product:** 2 (Somewhat disagree)
     - Even though the ad is effective, my unselfish nature means I prioritize budget and necessity over impulse purchases.

Overall, the advertisement effectively conveys positive attributes relevant to personal care. However, while appreciative of its good qualities, a combination of reserved tendencies, practicality in daily life, and financial considerations keep purchase intentions moderate.
