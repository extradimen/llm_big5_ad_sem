**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** (2) I find it somewhat negative given my tendency to worry and be emotionally stable.
   - **Interesting:** (3) Neutral; it doesn't grab my attention but isn’t entirely uninteresting either.
   - **Good:** (4) Moderately agree, acknowledging its preventive message though not fully convincing.
   - **Attractive:** (1) Strongly disagree; the claim feels manipulative rather than appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** (3) Neutral; I’m considering it but not strongly inclined.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** (3) Slightly leaning towards trying due to occasional tiredness, despite skepticism about the ad's tone.
   - **Consider buying this product:** (2) Mildly considerate given my daily lifestyle and some concerns over energy levels.

Overall, while I find aspects of the message relevant, its delivery feels somewhat aggressive and untrustworthy. This leaves me with moderate interest but low intent to purchase without further reassurance or personal experience.
