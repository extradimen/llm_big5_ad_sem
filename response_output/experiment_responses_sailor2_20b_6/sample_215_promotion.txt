**Explanation:**
- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - *Like:* Neutral, as the ad's messaging resonates at a basic level but isn't particularly compelling given my preference for practicality over appearance-focused promises.
  - *Interesting:* Disagree. The claim about energy and looks feels too generic to stand out or spark interest.
  - *Good:* Agree. It conveys positive attributes (energy boost, looking good), which align with general health goals.
  - *Attractive:* Disagree. Lack of uniqueness or strong visual appeal makes it unremarkable.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *Intend to purchase:* Neutral, since I appreciate the idea but not enough to prioritize this over my current routine.
  - *Try to buy:* Agree. There's a willingness to give new products a chance if they seem feasible and potentially beneficial.
  - *Consider buying:* Strongly Agree. Given my focus on efficiency and thoroughness in tasks (even though I tend to be careless at times), the concept of staying energized is appealing enough for serious consideration.

Overall, while the advertisement doesn't strongly attract me emotionally or visually, it holds functional value worth exploring further through a trial purchase.
