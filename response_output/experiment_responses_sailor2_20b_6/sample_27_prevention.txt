**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - **Like (Score 4):** While not strongly positive, I find the ad somewhat appealing.
   - **Interesting (Score 3):** The message is clear but doesn't captivate me deeply.
   - **Good (Score 5):** It presents a practical benefit to address tiredness and appearanceâ€”this resonates neutrally positively.
   - **Attractive (Score 2):** Not particularly attractive; it leans towards functional rather than engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score 6):** High likelihood of considering the purchase due to its perceived benefits, even if not immediately urgent.
   - **Try (Score 7):** Strong inclination to give it a try because it aligns with my need for sustained energy and appearance improvement.
   - **Consider (Score 5):** Moderate but firm consideration; I weigh practicality against other lifestyle factors.

This balanced evaluation reflects cautious optimism towards the product while maintaining critical skepticism about the ad's appeal. The focus on functional benefits influences purchase intentions despite a neutral-to-positive attitude towards the advertisement itself.
