**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 2) – While I appreciate energizing beverages for daily routines, the phrase seems generic and doesn't connect deeply with my preferences.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 3) – It lacks novelty or a compelling hook to captivate me personally.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 4) – The message about staying energized has value, but it feels rather standard and doesn't stand out in my crowded mental space of brand messages.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 1) – As someone who generally prefers more detailed or unique selling points, this broad claim lacks attractiveness.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2) – The general nature of the promise doesn't trigger a strong intent without specific benefits that resonate.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1) – Despite my need for energy boosters, I'm not inclined to make an effort based on this ad alone; other factors would be necessary.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2) – It's a possibility but only after seeing additional proof or personalized testimonials that align with my values.

Overall, the advertisement fails to engage me deeply due to its generic approach and lack of compelling details. While I acknowledge its potential benefits, it doesn't move me towards an immediate purchase decision.
