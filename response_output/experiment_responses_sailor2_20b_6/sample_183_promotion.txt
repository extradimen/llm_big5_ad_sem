2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Score = 4 (Agree)* 
   - The promise of staying energized and looking your best might catch my attention enough to find it engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Score = 5 (Strongly Agree)*
   - While I have a tendency for originality, the clear benefits align with self-care values common in Southeast Asian cultures; thus, seeing this as positive.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)* 
   - Given my strong agree on being careless and nervous easily, visual or aesthetic appeal doesn't strongly attract me.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - My cautious nature and tendency towards carelessness make immediate commitment low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)* 
   - While interesting, I'm not driven enough by the ad's message alone to actively seek purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Score = 3 (Neutral)**
   - If circumstances align or there are further endorsements from trusted sources, it could sway my decision slightly; otherwise, neutral inclination for now.
  
Overall, while the advertisement is intriguing and perceived positively, practical considerations and personal tendencies steer towards a more reserved approach to purchasing.
