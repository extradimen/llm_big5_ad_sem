**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score = 4):** The ad has an appealing message for staying energized and looking good, which resonates with my lifestyle. However, it's neutral rather than strongly positive.
    - **Interesting (Score = 3):** It piques curiosity but doesn't captivate me intensely due to familiarity with similar health product claims.
    - **Good (Score = 4):** The core message is well-presented and valuable, though not exceptional given the commonality of energy drinks in my market.
    - **Attractive (Score = 5):** The promise of daily improvement appeals to me; it's visually engaging and targets a broad audience positively.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score = 2):** While intrigued, I'm not committed enough to buy immediately due to the presence of other reliable brands in my shopping habits.
    - **Try (Score = 3):** There's a willingness to try based on its attractive features but no strong impulse yet.
    - **Consider (Score = 4):** It definitely nudges me towards consideration, especially if I see more positive reviews or promotions that align with the benefits highlighted.

Overall, while not strongly persuasive, the ad leaves a favorable impression and encourages mild curiosity and tentative interest in potential purchase.
