**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (4):**
   - While not strongly positive, I appreciate its straightforward message on energy and appearance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3):**
   - Neutral leaning slightly negative; it's fairly generic without capturing my attention deeply.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2):**
   - Doubtful about effectiveness since it lacks specific, compelling details for older consumers like me who prioritize practical benefits over surface-level appeal.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (1):**
   - Unattractive to someone more reserved and less inclined towards flashy claims.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2):**
   - Low intention; energy drinks are not my typical choice, especially given other health-focused alternatives I prefer.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (2):**
   - Slightly higher than intent but still low due to the lack of personal relevance and trust in broad appeal claims.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3):**
   - Moderately likely to keep it on my radar, considering its potential usefulness during periods requiring extra energy, though other factors like price, brand reputation, and actual experience would heavily influence any purchase decision. 

Overall, while I appreciate the message's intention, personal preferences, trust in everyday experiences, and practicality outweigh the general appeal of this advertisement for me.
