**Explanation:**

1. **Like the ad:** Neutral
   - My reserved nature and preference for thoroughness make me not immediately drawn to it, but it's neither strongly disliked nor liked.

2. **Interesting:** Agree
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with my need for focus on daily tasks, making it engaging.

3. **Believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree
   - I value a thorough job and find this claim credible enough to believe that such products can benefit me.

4. **Attractive:** Agree
   - While not overly flashy or compelling to my reserved side, its practical benefits make it appealing for daily use.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to purchase:** Neutral leaning toward Disagree (2)
   - Despite the positive attitude towards the ad, I am currently enrolled as a student and budget-conscious; immediate intent isn't strong due to monthly income constraints.

2. **Try to buy:** Neutral/Disagree leaning toward Neutral (3)
   - There's some interest but not enough urgency or financial flexibility to commit at this moment.

3. **Consider buying:** Agree (4)
   - The product aligns with my desire for practical solutions, so I would definitely keep it in mind and possibly make a purchase when circumstances allow.

Overall, while the ad is well-received critically, immediate action isn't guaranteed given personal constraints and priorities.
