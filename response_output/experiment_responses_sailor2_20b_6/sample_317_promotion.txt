**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - *I like the ad:* (2) While I appreciate the energy aspect appealing to my need for staying productive, it feels a bit superficial.
   - *Interesting:* (3) The message is straightforward but not particularly captivating or unique in this crowded market.
   - *Believe it's good:* (4) It sounds reasonable enough regarding health benefits, though I'm skeptical without more details.
   - *Attractive:* (5) Visually and emotionally appealing to those seeking energy boosts and improved appearance; aligns somewhat with my daily concerns.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase:* (3) Neutral leaning toward positive as it fits some needs, but the price might be a barrier.
   - *Will try to buy:* (3) Might give it a shot if there's an affordable promotion or reliable customer feedback.
   - *Consider buying:* (4) Definitely within consideration for future use due to its relevance in managing daily energy levels.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself, I recognize practical benefits aligning with my lifestyle and personal goals. However, cost constraints mean itâ€™s a cautious "consider" rather than an immediate buy decision.
