**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like:** (Score: 2) – Despite being talkative and outgoing in certain contexts, this ad's messaging feels too generic and lacks personal appeal to resonate with me.
2. **Interesting:** (Score: 3) – Neutral engagement; it doesn't capture my imagination or stand out amidst numerous similar health/beauty claims.
3. **Good:** (Score: 4) – It conveys basic benefits like energy and appearance, but the content feels superficial given other priorities in my life right now.
4. **Attractive:** (Score: 2) – The ad doesn't connect emotionally or appeal to any deep-seated values; it comes across as somewhat irrelevant.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend:** (Score: 1) – Strongly disagree; I don’t have a strong inclination to buy this product based on the current presentation.
2. **Try:** (Score: 1) – Similarly, no interest in giving it a trial purchase despite needing energy boosts occasionally.
3. **Consider:** (Score: 2) – Neutral leaning towards low consideration—though health and appearance are important, there needs to be more compelling evidence or connection before I'd seriously consider purchasing.

In summary, while the ad isn't entirely unappealing, its lack of depth in messaging fails to drive a meaningful connection with my reserved nature and current priorities. Consequently, it doesn’t motivate significant purchase intent from me.
