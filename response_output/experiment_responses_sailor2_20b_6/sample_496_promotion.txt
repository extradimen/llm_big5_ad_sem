**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral but leaning slightly negative. While I appreciate an energizing beverage, it doesn't significantly resonate with me.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Slightly agree. The promise of staying "energized and looking your best" sounds appealing in theory.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Agreed. It makes a clear, positive claim that aligns with general wellness goals, but it's not particularly compelling for me personally.
  
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree. The overall appeal and design don't strongly draw me in; I’m more reserved.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree. My current consumption habits are well-established, and a new energy drink doesn’t fit into my regular routine.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree. Given my preference for tried-and-tested products and limited enthusiasm from the ad, I see no immediate reason to switch or experiment.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree. There's a small chance if someone else recommends it or during periods of specific need (e.g., high-energy days), but it doesn’t top my list for regular purchases.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad’s message and concept, my reserved nature and established lifestyle make me less inclined to purchase this particular product. The low intent scores reflect a cautious approach rather than outright rejection.
