**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
  - *Like* (3): Neutral response due to reserved personality.
  - *Interesting* (4): Somewhat Agree, as it is engaging but not overly exciting for me personally.
  - *Good* (5): Agrees because it's appealing from a functional perspective, helping stay energized and look good.
  - *Attractive* (2): Disagree; the ad does not align strongly with my reserved nature or sense of appeal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - *Intend to purchase*: Neutral, balanced view but open to giving it a try based on its benefits.
  - *Try to buy*: Somewhat Agree, reflecting curiosity and willingness due to practical claims.
  - *Consider buying*: Agrees; helpful nature makes me think this could be beneficial for personal health and appearance. Despite initial reservations, the product's promise aligns with my values.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad somewhat persuasive, it isn't overwhelmingly attractive given my reserved personality. However, practical benefits drive a positive consideration toward purchasing or at least trying the product.
