**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral, as it connects with my concern for looking fresh and energetic but does not strongly resonate due to its somewhat manipulative tone.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree, because while I understand the message, it doesn't captivate me or stand out creatively.
   - **Believe is good:** Agree, since preventive health benefits are valued in Southeast Asian cultures where wellness is important; however, this belief leans more towards a practical assessment than emotional connection.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree, given the ad's overt sales pitch feels pushy rather than appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Neutral, as I appreciate potential health benefits but am not swayed enough by this specific ad to make an immediate decision.
   - **Will try to buy:** Disagree, due to skepticism about the effectiveness and the persuasive nature of the advertisement; additional information or personal testimonials might be needed.
   - **Consider buying:** Agree, because while I remain cautious, recognizing its potential value aligns with my helpful and thorough approach in considering health products for myself.

Overall, this ad effectively communicates a necessary message but fails to fully engage me due to its presentation style. While it prompts consideration of the product, it doesn't trigger an immediate purchase intent from someone like myself who values practicality and reliability over flashy marketing.
