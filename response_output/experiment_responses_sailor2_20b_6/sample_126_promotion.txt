**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral  
   - The energy aspect is appealing, but it might not align with my current needs or lifestyle preferences strongly enough to evoke strong liking.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree  
   - Promoting a product that helps both staying energized and looking good can spark curiosity among consumers.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree
   - The message of dual benefits (energy + appearance) feels well-rounded and beneficial, making it seem credible and thoughtful.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree  
   - While I appreciate its content, my preference for thoroughness means visual or emotional appeal needs more depth to fully engage me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Agree
   - Although not a strong intent yet, the dual benefits align with general wellness goals and might be worth trying.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Agree 
   - The practical value makes it likely for me to give it a shot if available.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** Strongly Agree
   - Given my helpful nature, prioritizing health, and the overall positive impression, Iâ€™m inclined to include this in my consideration list when needed. 

This balance reflects both cautious skepticism (attitude) and pragmatic interest (purchase intention), typical for someone who values thoroughness and practical benefits over immediate emotional appeal or extravagance.
