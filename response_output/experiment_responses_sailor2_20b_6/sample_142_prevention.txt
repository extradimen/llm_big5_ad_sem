**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2):** As a reserved and generally untrusting individual, I'm not drawn to overtly persuasive or manipulative marketing messages.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3):** The claim about fatigue and dull appearance could be marginally intriguing but lacks strong personal appeal due to my neutral sociability and tendency towards carefulness.
3. **Good (Score: 4):** I appreciate the straightforward approach, though it doesn't resonate deeply with me; a 7 would require more compelling evidence or connection to daily life.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3):** The adâ€™s messaging is functional but not particularly appealing given my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness over flashy presentations.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree due to skepticism regarding preventive products without concrete proof.
2. **Will try to buy (Score: 2):** Slightly inclined towards a trial, but not actively considering it based on current lifestyle and financial constraints (<15 million VND monthly income).
3. **Consider buying (Score: 3):** There's some consideration due to potential benefits against tiredness but balanced by my cautious nature and existing budget priorities.

Overall, the ad is somewhat relevant yet lacks strong motivation for a purchase given my personality traits and circumstances.
