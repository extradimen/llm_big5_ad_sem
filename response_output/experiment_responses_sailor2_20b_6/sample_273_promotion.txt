**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (score = 6):**
   - As a talkative and outgoing individual who values helpfulness, I appreciate engaging content that promises benefits.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 5):**
   - The energy-boosting aspect aligns with daily routines but doesn't captivate me enough due to my strong agreement on emotional stability.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 4):**
   - While I agree that staying energized and looking good are desirable, a postgraduate student might view this as an advertisement rather than a compelling health message.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 3):**
   - The simplicity of its appeal feels somewhat basic compared to my personality's depth; not visually or conceptually distinctive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 2):**
   - Despite the ad’s claims, I'm cautious due to a strongly disagreeing tendency towards general trust in advertisements.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 3):**
   - Curiosity may lead me to give it a trial if it's within my budget but not enough to actively seek purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 1):**
   - Given my strong agreement on thoroughness and following plans, I would only add it after evaluating alternatives or during periods of high energy need—considering rather than intending regularly.

In summary, while the ad resonates moderately due to its appeal to practical benefits, personal skepticism about ads and a preference for reliability reduce both immediate purchase intent and overall attractiveness.
