    - **Good**: Strongly Agree (score 6) — It conveys a positive image that resonates with my values of maintaining well-being.
    - **Attractive**: Disagree (score 3) — While the concept is appealing, it doesn't visually or emotionally captivate me enough.

2. **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral leaning towards Low Agree (score 2) — I appreciate its benefits but may prioritize other needs first.
    - **Try to Buy**: Neutral (score 2) — There's a slight nudge to give it a try, especially if offered at an attractive price point or during promotions.
