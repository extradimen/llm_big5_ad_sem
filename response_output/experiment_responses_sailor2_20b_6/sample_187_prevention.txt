**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like (Neutral):* The ad's message is straightforward but may not strongly appeal due to its generic nature; it resonates somewhat with my concern for energy levels but does not excite me deeply.
   - *Interesting (Agree):* As a manager, I appreciate how the advertisement highlights potential negative consequences if I don't take care of my energy and appearance, which aligns well with self-preservation concerns.
   - *Good (Strongly Agree):* The ad effectively presents benefits that address daily fatigue issues; its simplicity makes it easy to understand, reinforcing trust in preventive measures.
   - *Attractive (Agree):* While not overly attractive visually or emotionally, the message is clear and practical enough for me to find it appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend (Score 2)*: My generally trusting nature leads me towards considering health products positively, but personal financial constraints mean immediate purchase intent isn't high.
   - *Try (Score 3)*: Given the product's relevance and my tendency to be helpful with self-care, I am likely to give it a try if priced within budget limits or during sales promotions.
   - *Consider (Score 5)*: The ad sufficiently convinces me about its potential benefits; thus, it will definitely remain on my radar for future purchase opportunities.

In summary, while the advertisement strikes an appealing balance of simplicity and practicality, financial constraints and moderate appeal result in a mix of interest but not immediate intent. It scores well enough to encourage consideration as part of long-term self-care decisions.
