**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** Score of 4
    - While I appreciate it being talkative about addressing tiredness and dull appearance, the messaging feels somewhat exaggerated.
  - **Interesting:** Score of 3 
    - The concept is familiar and lacks novelty for me; thus, not very interesting.
  - **Good Quality (Credibility):** Score of 5
    - Neutral to positive, as it touches on common concerns but could use more specific scientific backing or testimonials.
  - **Attractive:** Score of 2 
    - It's not visually appealing nor emotionally engaging enough given my preference for authenticity over dramatization.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Score of 3 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)
    - The ad resonates somewhat but doesn’t compel me due to the lack of detailed benefits and trustworthiness.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Score of 2 (Disagree)
    - I'm not motivated enough by the advertisement alone to actively seek out a purchase; other factors would be necessary.
  - **Consider buying it in future scenarios:** Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    - Given my reserved and cautious nature, plus limited appeal from this ad, there’s low intent for consideration without further information or personal recommendations. 

Overall, while the message is relevant to common experiences, its execution falls short on engaging me as a consumer with strong social ties but specific preferences towards detailed, trustworthy communication.
