**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*  
   Being reserved and not particularly talkative or outgoing means I don't find it overly appealing but also won’t be put off by its presentation.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 4 (Agree)*  
   The promise of staying energized appeals to my practical side, making me see value in energy drinks for daily performance.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*  
   Lack of an active imagination and originality makes it hard for me to appreciate creative or groundbreaking claims; more factual benefits would be appreciated.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*  
   The focus on looks doesn’t strongly align with my priorities, but it's not a deterrent either—more functional aspects are key to me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*  
   While I appreciate its benefits, the high frequency of worries and emotional instability make me cautious about committing without further evaluation or necessity.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*  
   Given my financial constraints (36-45 million VND) and preference for careful spending as a civil servant, I’m unlikely to actively seek it out unless necessary.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)**  
   Although the benefits are noted, overall neutrality means there’s no strong pull to make an immediate or significant investment in such a purchase without specific need fulfillment or financial wiggle room. 

In summary, while the ad has some merits and practical appeal, its effectiveness for me is limited due to my reserved nature, cautious spending habits, and high levels of worry; it might not drive an imminent buy decision but keeps options open if needed circumstances arise.
