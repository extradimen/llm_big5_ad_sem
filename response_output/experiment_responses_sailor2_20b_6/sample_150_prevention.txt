**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 5):** The direct messaging feels somewhat compelling but lacks emotional resonance.
   - **Interesting (score = 6):** The preventive message is attention-grabbing, suggesting potential benefits of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance.
   - **Good (score = 5.5):** While straightforward, the ad could benefit from more engaging visuals or personal testimonials to bolster credibility.
   - **Attractive (score = 4):** It meets basic expectations but doesn't deeply connect with my sociable nature due to its clinical tone.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 3):** The adâ€™s message resonates slightly, but the limited budget and existing routines lower immediate intent.
   - **Will try to buy this product (score = 3.5):** I might consider a trial if it aligns with my regular spending habits or offers some special promotions.
   - **Consider buying the product (score = 2.5):** Ultimately, cautious about committing without more information on efficacy and value for money.

In summary, though intrigued by the preventive benefits highlighted in the ad, personal preferences favor a balanced approach where emotional appeal is strengthened alongside practical considerations. The scores reflect an acceptable yet non-compelling endorsement, guiding towards consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
