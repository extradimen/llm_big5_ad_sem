2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4):** There's a moderate level of interest due to its relatability with daily fatigue; however, it lacks emotional impact.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2):** While effective in conveying potential issues without the product, I question its overall effectiveness and credibility.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3):** Slightly attractive but not compelling due to my generally guarded nature and lack of emotional stability highlighted by personality traits.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree, as I prioritize budget constraints given monthly income.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** Might consider a trial but not with high conviction due to cost and existing skepticism about the need for such products.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3):** Open to considering it, especially if reviews are positive or there's an affordable option fitting my financial constraints.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to daily life concerns, personal traits lead me to a balanced yet slightly negative attitude toward the ad and cautious purchase intent.
