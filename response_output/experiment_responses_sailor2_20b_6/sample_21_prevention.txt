**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - I like the ad (Score: 3): Neutral; while it's not unappealing, it doesn't stand out as particularly engaging.
   - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): Slightly agree; it offers a warning that can draw attention but lacks creativity or novelty for me.
   - I believe the ad is good (Score: 2): Disagree; the message feels overused and clich√©, lacking credibility or fresh insight.
   - I find the ad attractive (Score: 3): Neutral; visually acceptable but not compelling enough to capture my interest.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. Despite being a civil servant with some disposable income, fatigue relief isn't high on my priority list.
   - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2): Slightly agree; it might be worth trying out once for the sake of curiosity but not with strong conviction.
   - I will consider buying this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree. The ad's message does not resonate deeply enough, and there are more important things to spend money on.

In summary, while the advertisement is moderately attention-grabbing, it falls short in engaging someone like me who values trust, thoroughness, and practicality over emotional or imaginative appeals. Therefore, I have low purchase intention despite finding parts of the ad decently tolerable.
