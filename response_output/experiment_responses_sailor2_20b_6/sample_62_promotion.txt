**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
   - Despite being a blue-collar worker with stress from work and personal worries (Strongly Agree on "worry a lot"), I do not feel strongly drawn to an energizing drink promotion. The advertisement's focus may appear superficial compared to my current needs.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
   - It doesn't spark excitement, but neither does it bore me completely—it’s just average in terms of engagement for someone like me who values practicality over flashy presentations.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4 (Agree)*
   - While not compelling enough to entice me instantly, I acknowledge that staying energized and looking presentable are valid benefits, especially relevant for maintaining job performance and social interactions post-divorce.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)* 
   - Visually or conceptually, it doesn’t strongly capture my attention; there's a moderate appeal but not enough to move me emotionally or practically toward purchasing immediately.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Given the current budget constraints and prioritizing other essential needs, an impulse buy on such a drink doesn’t align with my financial stability plan.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)* 
   - Although I acknowledge its potential benefits, there's no immediate push or urgency compelling me to actively seek it out and make the effort for purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)**
   - If faced with a suitable discount or if my financial situation improves, I might entertain considering it, but at present, other priorities take precedence over an energy drink.

Overall, while understanding its value, the advertisement does not strongly resonate with my cautious and reserved nature. Hence, high purchase intention scores are low, reflecting my current lifestyle constraints and personal inclinations.
