**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like the ad*: Neutral (5). The energy aspect resonates slightly but doesn't strongly excite me.
   - *Interesting* : Somewhat Agree (4). It’s mildly engaging, especially considering my active lifestyle and need for energy boosts.
   - *Believe it's good*: Disagree (3). While I appreciate the claims, they feel generic without specific details or proof of effectiveness.
   - *Attractive*: Somewhat Agree (4). The visual appeal is decent but not enough to strongly attract me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Neutral/Undecided (2). I’m open-minded, considering my need for energy supplements, though the ad alone isn't compelling.
   - *Will try to buy*: Mildly Agree (3). The idea of trying it is there since staying energized aligns with personal goals.
   - *Consider buying*: Mildly Agree (3). My helpful and unselfish nature might push me towards considering this product for daily use, balancing practicality.

Overall, the ad captures some attention but lacks persuasive depth. While I find aspects appealing, my decision-making process hinges on more concrete details or personal experience rather than just the advertisement. Thus, there's a neutral to slightly positive inclination without immediate commitment.
