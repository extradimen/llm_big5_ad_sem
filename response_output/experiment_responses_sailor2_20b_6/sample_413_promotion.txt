**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: 
  - *Like*: Neutral because while it appeals at a functional level, personal traits like being slightly nervous and worrying make me cautious.
  - *Interesting*: Slightly agree due to the promise of energy and appearance improvement, which are relevant daily concerns.
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree as the message aligns with my need for wellness products that offer practical benefits.
  - *Attractive*: Agree because it visually presents a healthy lifestyle appeal.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
  - *Intend to purchase*: Neutral since though appealing, current financial stability and budgeting make me cautious about committing without further research.
  - *Will try to buy*: Neutral; the desire for wellness is balanced by practicalities like availability, pricing, and reviews.
  - *Consider buying*: Strongly Agree due to my belief in its value proposition (energy & appearance) despite occasional doubts. It remains a viable option for future consideration.

Overall, while I find the ad convincing enough to consider purchasing, personal traits such as nervousness and careful decision-making affect immediate intent but not long-term interest. Hence, a balanced mix of skepticism and openness towards trying it out in due course.
