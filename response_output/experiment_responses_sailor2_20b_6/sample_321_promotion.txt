**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)
   - Neutral to slightly positive. Given my preference for practicality and the lack of strong emotional connection with energy drinks or appearance claims.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2) 
   - Slightly disagree; find it moderately engaging but not compelling enough due to a mix of skepticism about instant energizing effects and personal health priorities.

- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 1)
   - Strongly disagree. The claims seem too exaggerated, lacking in specific details or genuine appeal that resonate with my cautious and critical nature.

- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 1) 
   - Strongly disagree; visuals and messaging don't align with my personal values or needs, making it unattractive to me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1)
   - Strongly disagree. Given my tendency towards practicality, skepticism about quick fixes, and focus on budget constraints, the advertised benefits don't motivate a purchase intent.

- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1) 
   - Disagree; no compelling reason or personal need encourages me to make an effort toward buying it.

- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2)
   - Neutral leaning towards slightly agree. Although highly skeptical, if I were in a situation where immediate energy boost was needed and the price aligned with my budget, there might be minimal considerationâ€”though unlikely without further convincing evidence or genuine need. 

Overall, while the advertisement does not capture my interest or trust effectively, it still falls into low-to-neutral evaluation due to external circumstances influencing decision-making (e.g., emergency situations). However, regular purchase intent remains very low given my personality traits and current lifestyle priorities.
