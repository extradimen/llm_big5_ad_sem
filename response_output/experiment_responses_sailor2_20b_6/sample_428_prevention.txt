**Explanation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - Despite being talkative and outgoing, I find it only moderately appealing. The message feels somewhat generic.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 4 (Agree)
   - It holds attention with a clear promise to avoid fatigue and dullness, which resonates slightly with my everyday experiences but lacks novelty for strong interest.

- **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - The message appears truthful about potential benefits. However, no emotional or imaginative engagement draws me in fully.

- **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - It doesn't visually attract nor emotionally connect deeply; hence, it seems unremarkable.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my monthly income constraints and skepticism about immediate needs for such products, I'm not inclined to buy impulsively.

- **I will try to buy this product:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - There's a slight curiosity but insufficient motivation or trust in the claim to make an effortful purchase decision.

- **I will consider buying this product:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - While not highly inclined, I'm open to evaluating it more deeply if circumstances align with perceived benefits and affordability. 

Overall, while understanding its premise, the ad lacks compelling charm or urgency for a blue-collar worker in my demographic, balancing financial constraints and personal engagement.
