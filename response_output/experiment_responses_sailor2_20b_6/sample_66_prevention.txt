**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Score 3)**: Neutral leaning slightly towards liking; it's engaging but not overly compelling.
   - **Interesting (Score 2)**: I find it somewhat interesting due to its straightforward messaging about fatigue and appearance, though not highly captivating.
   - **Good (Score 4)**: The ad conveys a clear message effectively enough, so it rates as moderately good.
   - **Attractive (Score 1)**: My reserved personality and tendency towards caution make me find this rather unattractive; I'm skeptical of such promises.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: While the ad makes a point about fatigue relief, my cautious nature means strong intentions are not formed (2).
   - **Try to Buy**: Mild interest but no firm decision yet (2).
   - **Consider Buying**: Open to considering it based on necessity if I feel tired or dull; however, other factors like brand trust would also influence the final decision (2).

Overall, while understanding its purpose and finding some merit in its message, personal skepticism and cautious nature result in a mixed but generally positive yet reserved reaction. Purchase intentions are low-key due to lack of urgency or strong emotional connection.
