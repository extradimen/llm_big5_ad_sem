**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: 
  - **Like (6)**: As a talkative and outgoing individual who values thoroughness, I appreciate how straightforwardly energizing and looking best are promoted. It resonates well with my lifestyle.
  - **Interesting (5)**: Neutral due to mixed feelings; while it presents an appealing concept, the execution might lack creativity compared to what strongly imaginative ads would offer for someone like me.
  - **Good (4)**: Slightly agreeable because I appreciate its functional benefits but don’t see high emotional engagement or uniqueness that truly excites me.
  - **Attractive (5)**: Neutral attractiveness; it effectively targets my desire for productivity and self-care, making a decent impression.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
  - **Intend to purchase (3)**: I am open-minded but wouldn’t immediately commit due to financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and the need to balance budget priorities.
  - **Try to buy (4)**: Somewhat likely since it aligns with my health goals; might consider purchasing after assessing its cost-effectiveness against comparable alternatives.
  - **Consider buying (5)**: The ad sparks interest, making me more conscious of trying such a product at an appropriate time or during special offers.

Overall, while the advertisement captures important aspects relevant to my values and daily life concerns, it may not lead directly to immediate purchase due to pragmatic considerations. However, I remain open and willing to consider incorporating this type of energy drink into my routine if the circumstances align well with my budget and lifestyle balance.
