**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - *Like*: Neutral (3). The ad resonates slightly but not strongly given my personality, particularly as it's more about energy and appearance which aligns with general well-being without strong emotional appeal for me.
  - *Interesting*: Disagree (2). I find this claim somewhat generic; most health drinks make similar promises. It lacks specific details that would grab my interest.
  - *Good*: Agree (4). While itâ€™s straightforward, the message about staying energized and looking good is credible enough to be considered a "good" advertisement by objective standards.
  - *Attractive*: Neutral (3). The overall presentation may not strongly attract me due to personal preferences leaning towards practicality over aesthetics.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - *Intend*: Strongly Agree (5). Given my busy managerial role, maintaining energy and appearance is crucial; thus, I am inclined to consider such a product.
  - *Try* and *Consider*: Both Strongly Agree (6). My tendency towards thoroughness combined with the practical benefits aligns well with trying out this drink even though I'm generally careful. The ad's claims fit my needs enough for serious consideration.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about its presentation or novelty, the message effectively addresses aspects important to me personally and professionally, leading to strong purchase intent.
