**Evaluation Details:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **Like (3)**: The message of staying energized and looking good resonates slightly but not strongly with my lifestyle.
2. **Interesting (2)**: While the concept is understandable, it doesn't grab much attention as I prefer more practical benefits in advertisements.
3. **Good (4)**: Neutral to positive; appreciates that maintaining energy and appearance can be important for daily functioning.
4. **Attractive (3)**: Slightly attractive but not compelling enough given my reserved nature and focus on simpler, everyday needs.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend (2)**: Not a strong intention to buy as the product feels more like an indulgence rather than a necessity.
2. **Try (1)**: Low likelihood of trying because regular routines with affordable alternatives are preferred.
3. **Consider (2)**: Might consider if there's a significant need for energy boosts or it becomes part of ongoing offers, but not at full price.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly engage my values and preferences as an older blue-collar worker who prioritizes practicality over luxury products. Hence, while understanding its appeal, I'm unlikely to make a purchase based on this advertisement alone.
