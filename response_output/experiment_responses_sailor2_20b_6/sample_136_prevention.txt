**Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad**: Neutral (3) - While it’s engaging in a preventive health context, my reserved and somewhat critical nature means I don't find it overly compelling.
2. **Interesting**: Slightly Agree (4) – The message is straightforward but not particularly eye-catching for me given my personality.
3. **Believe the Ad is Good**: Agree (5) - From an educated civil servant's perspective, it conveys a clear health benefit without being exaggerated, making it credible and aligned with rational thinking.
4. **Attractive**: Slightly Agree (4) – The appeal feels moderate; not enough to stand out but effective in its simplicity.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (3) - Although the ad is well-crafted, personal factors like daily routines and budgeting might prevent immediate purchase intent.
2. **Try to Buy**: Slightly Agree (4) – There's a moderate inclination to give it a try as maintaining energy levels aligns with my career demands.
3. **Consider Buying**: Agree (5) - The message resonates enough for me to seriously consider adding this product to future shopping lists, given its potential benefits.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its value proposition but doesn't ignite strong emotional engagement or immediate action due to personal preferences and practical considerations.
