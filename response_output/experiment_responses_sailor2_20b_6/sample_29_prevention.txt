### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Disagree (3) - While it's not bad, its straightforward messaging doesn't resonate deeply with me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral (2) - The concept feels somewhat clich√© and lacks novelty for my taste.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Slightly Agree (3) - It effectively conveys a preventive message but could be more engaging or creative.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Personally, I prefer ads that are less fear-based and more inspiring.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Agree (4) - The functional benefits align with my needs for energy and appearance maintenance.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Considered Likely (4) - If it meets expectations, I'm willing to give it a chance despite some reservations about the advertising style.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Quite High Consideration (5) - While not immediately compelling, the perceived value justifies further evaluation.
