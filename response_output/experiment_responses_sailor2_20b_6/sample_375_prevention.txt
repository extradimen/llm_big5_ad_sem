**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 2) – While persuasive in a subtle way about potential negative effects of not drinking this product, it's not particularly appealing to me.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3) – Neutral; there’s an element of attention-grabbing but doesn't engage deeply given my reserved nature and cautious approach.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4) – Fairly positive, acknowledging its effective messaging in highlighting risks to health appearance.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 1) – Strongly disagree; it lacks emotional appeal or a compelling visual presentation that would resonate with me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 3) – Somewhat considerate, recognizing the potential benefits but not driven enough by the ad alone.
- **Will try to buy this product:** (Score = 2) – Mildly inclined; I might explore more information or reviews before making a decision.
- **Will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2) – Neutral lean towards considering, influenced mainly by its preventive message rather than immediate appeal.

Overall, while the ad is effective in presenting a deterrent scenario, it doesn't strongly connect with my reserved and methodical nature. I'm open to exploring but not compelled enough to purchase impulsively. Hence, moderate scores reflect balanced consideration without high enthusiasm or urgency.
