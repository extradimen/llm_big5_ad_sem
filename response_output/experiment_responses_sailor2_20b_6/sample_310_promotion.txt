  - **2. I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):** The concept of energy enhancement and looking good appeals somewhat but doesn't wow me.
  - **3. I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):** It conveys a clear value proposition, making it reasonably credible for its target audience.
  - **4. I find the ad attractive (Score = 2):** The overall aesthetic or appeal to my tastes isn't strong, given my limited artistic interests.

- **Purchase Intention Scores Explanation:**
  - **1. I intend to purchase this product (Score = 3):** Neutral intention; though beneficial features are acknowledged, there's no immediate drive.
  - **2. I will try to buy this product (Score = 4):** Openness to give it a shot based on its perceived benefits and the general trust in promotions.
