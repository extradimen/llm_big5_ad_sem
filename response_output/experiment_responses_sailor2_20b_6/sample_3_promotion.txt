**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
  - *Like (5/7):* The promise of staying energized and looking good resonates with my need for a balanced lifestyle, making it somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so due to personal reservation and cautious nature.
  - *Interesting (4/7)*: It piques curiosity because energy drinks are familiar in Southeast Asian markets, yet I expect more engaging content or evidence.
  - *Good (3/7):* The ad seems straightforward and functional, lacking deeper emotional appeal. While not bad, it could be better tailored to my values.
  - *Attractive (2/7)*: The overall design isn't particularly compelling for me; simplicity might come across as uninspired given my preference for more engaging visuals.

- **Purchase intention:** 
  - *Intend (3/7):* I am open to the idea, but wouldn’t rush into buying. My practical approach means I need reassurance about quality and benefits.
  - *Try (3/7)*: There’s a willingness to give it a shot if recommended by trusted sources or during sales periods.
  - *Consider (4/7):* It's definitely in my consideration set, especially considering its alignment with personal goals of productivity and appearance. I'll weigh options alongside budget constraints.

In summary, while the ad holds moderate appeal due to practical benefits, it doesn’t fully connect emotionally for me—resulting in a balanced but cautious attitude towards purchasing. The product is considered worthy of trial under certain conditions.
