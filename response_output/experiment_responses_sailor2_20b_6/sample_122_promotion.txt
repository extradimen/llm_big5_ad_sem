**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Neutral to slightly positive (score = 3). As a reserved individual who values unselfishness but tends to be careless and nervous, I'm not strongly drawn to promotional content.
  - **Interesting:** Agreeable (score = 4) because staying energized is relevant; however, the promise of "looking your best" may seem superficial for my personality type.
  - **Good:** Tolerant acceptance (score = 5). It’s generic and somewhat believable but doesn't excite me due to my strong agreement on tendency towards carelessness.
  - **Attractive:** Mildly unappealing (score = 2) because the visual elements or message style might not align with my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1). Given my financial constraints and cautious approach, I'm unlikely to make a high-priority purchase.
  - **Try to Buy:** Slightly inclined towards curiosity but hesitant (score = 2). Might consider sampling if it’s affordable or on promotion.
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral with slight consideration (score = 3). Though the benefits sound good, my financial limitations and lack of urgency weigh against a definitive decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the relevance to energy levels, external validation isn't compelling enough for immediate action. Thus, these scores reflect a balanced mix between mild interest and practical reservations.
