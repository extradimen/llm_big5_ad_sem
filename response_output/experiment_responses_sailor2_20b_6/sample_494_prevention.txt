**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree (`2`). While the message about fatigue and dullness is relevant, my reserved nature means I'm not particularly drawn to it.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral (`3`). It's straightforward but lacks emotional or imaginative appeal that resonates with me more strongly.
   - **Good Ad:** Neutral (`3`). The ad conveys a clear benefit without being overly persuasive; hence, neither positively nor negatively impacting my view too much.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (`4`). Though not highly attractive to an outgoing person like myself, it is functional and credible enough to catch attention.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Agree (`5`). I appreciate thorough planning and the ad's straightforward message aligns with my needs.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Agree (`6`). Given its clear benefits, itâ€™s worth giving a trial run despite being careful by nature (though not careless).
   - **Consider buying this product:** Strongly Agree (`7`). The structured and reliable lifestyle I maintain supports trying out products that address fatigue effectively, even if the ad's presentation isn't my top preference. 

Overall, while the advertisement may lack emotional punch or creativity for me, its practical benefits and alignment with personal needs make it highly likely to influence a purchase decision.
