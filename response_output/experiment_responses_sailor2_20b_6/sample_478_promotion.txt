**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4/7):** The ad's promise of energy and looking good resonates to some extent but doesn't strongly excite me.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** While it offers a clear benefit, I feel the message is somewhat generic and lacks unique appeal for my specific needs or interests.
   - **Good (2/7):** The ad seems adequate in conveying its benefits, though not particularly compelling with just "staying energized" as a selling point; more details might improve credibility.
   - **Attractive (5/7):** It's visually appealing and generally attractive, but the messaging could be stronger to fully engage me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (3/7):** While I acknowledge its potential value, it doesnâ€™t trigger a strong desire or immediate intent to buy due to moderate trust in such claims.
   - **Try (2/7):** Given my tendency towards being cautious and thorough but also prone to carelessness, trying the product falls under "maybe later" rather than an urgent priority.
   - **Consider (4/7):** I will think about it, especially if there are reviews or more specific details supporting its efficacy. My neutral-to-agree stance on helpfulness suggests openness to considering health and wellness products.

Overall, while the ad is decently engaging with visual appeal and a clear benefit, it needs to address my skepticism (Disagree in trusting) by providing more substantiated claims and unique selling points relevant to someone like me. This would elevate both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention scores further.
