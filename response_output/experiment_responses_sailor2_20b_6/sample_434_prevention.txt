**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad (4):* The message is straightforward and targets common concerns about energy levels and appearance.
   - *Interesting (3):* It's somewhat engaging but not exceptionally creative or unique in its approach.
   - *Good (5):* Clear benefits are presented, which can be appealing; however, it could provide more detailed information for higher appeal.
   - *Attractive (2):* The simplicity may feel a bit dull and lacks emotional depth, making it less compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (3):* While the ad resonates with my concern about fatigue and appearance, I'm not fully convinced without more substantial evidence.
   - *Will try to buy this product (4):* Given its relevance, there's a willingness to give it a try as long as price and brand reputation align well.
   - *Consider buying this product (6):* The ad nudges me towards considering the purchase due to my need for energy boosters, but further research is required before committing.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively highlights potential problems without its drink, I find it moderately appealing yet slightly underwhelming in creativity and emotional connection. This leads to a cautious inclination to consider purchasing if additional factors align positively.
