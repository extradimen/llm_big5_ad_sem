**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning towards positive; it's not extremely engaging but has some appeal due to its relevance.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**: Mildly agree, as I find prevention messages generally informative but not overly captivating for daily consumption.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**: Slightly positive; it effectively highlights potential negative outcomes without being too dramatic or manipulative.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards neutral, as its straightforward message doesn't grab my attention enough.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 3)**: Moderate consideration; the ad nudges but does not drive a strong intent.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**: Low likelihood of immediate action, as my current energy levels and routines are well-managed without needing it immediately.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**: Minimal consideration; while I understand the benefits, other factors like budget or habit override a potential purchase in the short term.

In summary, the ad is perceived positively enough to be informative but doesn't provoke strong personal resonance for immediate action given my cautious nature and current situation. Therefore, it scores moderately on attitude but lower on direct intention to buy.
