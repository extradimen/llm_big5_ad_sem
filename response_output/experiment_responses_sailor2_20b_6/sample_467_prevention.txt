**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - **Like (Score: 3)** – Neutral; I don't dislike the ad but it doesn’t evoke strong positive feelings.
  - **Interesting (Score: 2)** – Disagree; The premise feels overly simplistic and not engaging enough for me personally.
  - **Good (Score: 3)** – Neutral; It's effective at conveying a benefit, but lacks depth or novelty to be outstanding. 
  - **Attractive (Score: 2)** – Disagree; I find the message generic rather than attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 4)** – Neutral leaning towards agree; The ad's claim resonates with my need for energy, but isn't compelling enough on its own.
  - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 5)** – Agree; There’s a sense of curiosity and potential value, prompting me to give it a try if conveniently available or priced well.
  - **Consider Buying (Score: 4)** – Neutral leaning towards agree; The product consideration is influenced by its utility despite not being completely sold on the ad messaging.

Overall, while there's acknowledgment of the drink’s benefits, my cautious nature and preference for thoroughness mean I need additional factors like convenience, reviews, or brand reputation to make a final purchase decision.
