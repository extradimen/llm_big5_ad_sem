**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**  
  *Neutral* - The claim about fatigue and dullness is somewhat compelling but not enough to evoke strong positive feelings.

- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**  
  *Somewhat Agree* - It piques my curiosity, especially since staying alert and energetic are important aspects of daily life for me as a civil servant.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2)**  
  *Disagree* - The ad feels slightly exaggerated to sell the drink; it doesnâ€™t sufficiently build trust or offer clear evidence supporting its benefits.

- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**  
  *Neutral* - It has a decent appeal, but I wouldn't go out of my way to be drawn in by this single message alone.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**
  *Strongly Disagree*: Although it addresses concerns about fatigue and appearance, there are no compelling reasons for me to commit to buying this particular drink over other options I know or trust better.

- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**  
  *Strongly Disagree*: My skepticism outweighs any temporary interest; trying is unlikely without further evidence of effectiveness or recommendations from peers/trusted sources.

- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**
  *Neutral* - If the price point aligns well and I see repeat positive experiences shared by others, it might be considered as a potential choice among various alternatives in my routine. However, it doesn't currently rank high on my list.

In summary, while acknowledging its relevance to my daily challenges, both the advertisement's persuasive impact and my immediate purchase intention remain low due to lack of strong evidence, trust issues, and availability of other familiar solutions.
