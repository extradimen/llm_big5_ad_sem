**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score of 2* - I don't particularly like it because it feels slightly manipulative and overemphasizes negative outcomes without much substance.
   
2. **Interesting**: *Score of 3* - It's not very engaging; the message is straightforward but lacks originality or creativity.

3. **Believe the ad is good:** *Score of 4* - I acknowledge it tries to be persuasive, but personally, I don't find its claims compelling enough to strongly endorse.

4. **Attractive**: *Score of 1* - It's not visually or emotionally attractive; the emphasis on "looking dull" may feel exaggerated and unrealistic for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** *Score of 1* - Given my reserved nature, trust issues with such claims, and limited budget (monthly income <15 million VND), I have no immediate intention to buy it.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** *Score of 1* - No motivation or urgency exists for me to actively seek out this drink despite occasional feelings of tiredness.

3. **Consider buying the product:** *Score of 2* - There is a slight consideration, but ultimately, other factors (e.g., budget constraints and skepticism) outweigh any mild interest generated by the ad.

Overall, while I acknowledge the potential relevance for feeling energized or looking more vibrant, my reserved nature, cautious outlook, and practical considerations lead to low scores in both attitude and purchase intention.
