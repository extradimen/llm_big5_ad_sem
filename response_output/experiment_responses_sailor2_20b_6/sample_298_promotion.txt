**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude
- **Like:** Neutral-like score of 5. I appreciate the energy aspect but don't find it overly appealing.
- **Interesting:** Scored as a 4 because while it's straightforward, there’s nothing particularly engaging in its message for me personally.
- **Good:** Somewhat agree (3). The claim to help stay energized and look good is reasonable but not compelling enough given my other priorities and skepticism about quick fixes.
- **Attractive:** Mildly attractive score of 2. It lacks the emotional or personal connection needed to genuinely draw me in; I'm more reserved and emotionally stable-seeking, so a stronger benefit would be necessary.

### Purchase Intention
- **Intend to purchase:** Strongly disagree (1). Given my current financial constraints and skepticism about wellness products' effectiveness, I am not inclined towards an immediate buy.
- **Try to buy:** Score of 2. There's some curiosity but not enough motivation or trust in the product’s promises to actively seek it out.
- **Consider buying:** Marginally consider (3). If other factors align—such as a discount offer or trusted reviews—I might contemplate purchasing, but overall, my intent remains low.

This evaluation reflects that while I appreciate basic claims of energy and aesthetics, more personalized benefits and trustworthiness are required to turn this ad from interesting to compelling for me.
