**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score = 5)**: Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate its aim but it doesn't evoke strong feelings.
   - **Interesting (Score = 6)**: Agreeable since staying energized and looking good are appealing concepts, especially for someone in my occupation.
   - **Good (Score = 4.5)**: Somewhat credible, given the promise of both energy boost and aesthetic benefits; however, it could be more detailed about how these outcomes are achieved.
   - **Attractive (Score = 5)**: Moderately attractive because I align with the need for daily boosts yet am cautious about its claims.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Score of 3 indicates hesitation rather than strong intent, given my preference for thorough information and trust.
   - **Try to Buy (Score = 2)**: Low score due to concerns regarding the product's effectiveness without more details on ingredients or user testimonials.
   - **Consider Buying**: Score of 4 reflects a balanced approach where I am open but not compelled by just seeing this ad. Additional reviews and evidence would sway me further.

Overall, while the advertisement appeals to my needs, it lacks sufficient detail for an immediate purchase decision, leading to moderate interest rather than strong intent.
