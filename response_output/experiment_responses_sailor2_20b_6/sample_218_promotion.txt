}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - I like the ad (score = 3): While it's not my favorite style of advertising, there are aspects that appeal.
   - The ad is interesting (score = 4): It presents a clear benefit for staying energized and looking good, which resonates somewhat but doesn't captivate me fully.
   - I believe the ad is good (score = 5): Neutral to slightly positive; it has credibility in its messaging.
   - I find the ad attractive (score = 2): Given my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality over appearance, it lacks personal appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - Intent to purchase this product (score = 4): My strong sense of responsibility means considering healthier choices, but not a high priority right now.
   - Will try to buy the product (score = 5): There's an inclination due to its claimed benefits; I might give it a chance if offered at a reasonable price.
   - Consider buying the product (score = 6): Given my budget constraints and need for sustainable energy, there is high consideration despite initial reservations.

Overall, while the ad has some persuasive elements aligned with practical needs, my reserved nature and existing concerns about cost make me moderately interested without overwhelming enthusiasm.
