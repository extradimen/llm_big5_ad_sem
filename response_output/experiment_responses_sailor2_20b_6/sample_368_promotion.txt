**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad (score=4):* The promise of staying energized is appealing, but it doesn't connect deeply with my preferences. It falls short on personal resonance.
  - *Interesting (5):* As a talkative and sometimes outgoing person, I find the concept intriguing—staying energized can benefit social interactions—but not overwhelmingly so.
  - *Good (3):* Neutral to negative; while I appreciate energy drinks' benefits in theory, my natural skepticism makes me question its credibility without more concrete evidence or personal relevance.
  - *Attractive (2):* Not very attractive due to the lack of a compelling connection with my values and trust issues.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (score=1):* Strongly disagree; despite energy benefits, my budget constraints ($<15,000,000 VND) and cautious nature make an outright intention unlikely.
  - *Will try to buy this product (2):* Slightly higher than intent but still low—might consider it if I had extra funds or received a good discount/promo.
  - *Consider buying the product (3):* Moderate consideration; given my active imagination and innovative nature, there's slight interest in trying new things. However, emotional instability and financial limitations keep this at a cautious level.

Overall, while intrigued by the concept of staying energized, the ad doesn't sufficiently align with my personal experiences, trust issues, budget constraints, or sense of practicality to drive high intent for purchase. Thus, scores reflect mild interest but low likelihood of immediate action.
