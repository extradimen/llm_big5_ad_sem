**Evaluation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (Score = 4)** - While it's mildly engaging due to its energetic promise and appearance appeal, my personal preferences tilt more towards authenticity rather than overly promotional claims.
2. **Interesting (Score = 3)** - The concept seems basic for energy drinks; I don't find the messaging particularly unique or intriguing.
3. **Good (Score = 2)** - There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it lacks depth and fails to connect emotionally.
4. **Attractive (Score = 5)** - Visually appealing elements may draw some attention, making me feel neutral-to-positive about its attractiveness.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score = 1)** - Strongly disagree; the ad does not motivate me enough given my financial constraints and lack of compelling benefits.
2. **Try to Buy (Score = 1)** - Also strongly disagree; no urgency or personal relevance drives me to experiment with this product.
3. **Consider Buying (Score = 2)** - Neutral-to-mildly considerate; while the idea of staying energized is appealing, competing factors like budget and alternatives weigh heavily.

Overall, though somewhat engaging visually and promising basic benefits, the ad falls short in inspiring a purchase decision due to its lack of emotional resonance and practical appeal within my context.
