**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score=3):** Neutral to slightly negative; I don’t dislike it but find it average.
  - **Interesting (score=4):** Somewhat interesting, though not captivating enough for me personally.
  - **Good (score=2):** Not particularly good in terms of persuasiveness or creativity—it falls short.
  - **Attractive (score=1):** Very unattractive; the claim feels overgeneralized and manipulative.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (score=1):** Strongly disagree; no immediate intention based on this ad.
  - **Will try to buy this product (score=2):** Slightly agree, but only if circumstances change or further information becomes compelling.
  - **Consider buying the product (score=3):** Neutral to slightly positive; might consider it after evaluating more thoroughly, given my cautious nature.

Overall, while I acknowledge that the ad taps into common fatigue concerns, its lack of specific benefits and a strong emotional connection doesn't resonate with me. As a blue-collar worker balancing daily responsibilities, authenticity in product claims is crucial for consideration. Thus, these scores reflect both my neutral-to-negative reaction to the ad's presentation and cautious approach towards making purchases based on such generic appeals.
