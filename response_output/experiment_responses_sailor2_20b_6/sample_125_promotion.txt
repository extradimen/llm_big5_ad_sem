**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement
- **I like the ad.**: Neutral (4). Given my reserved nature and careful approach, I appreciate well-crafted ads but this one doesn’t evoke strong positive feelings.
- **I think the ad is interesting.**: Disagree (3). The promise of energy and looking good feels generic rather than intriguing to me personally.
- **I believe the ad is good.**: Strongly Disagree (2). It lacks specificity, credibility, or compelling evidence that resonates with my cautious mindset as a civil servant.
- **I find the ad attractive.**: Disagree (3). The claims are superficial and don’t align closely enough with my values or lifestyle to be appealing.

### Purchase Intention
- **I intend to purchase this product.**: Disagree (2). Despite needing some energy boost, I’m skeptical of quick fixes without solid backing.
- **I will try to buy this product.**: Strongly Disagree (1). My cautious and thorough nature prevents me from acting impulsively on vague assurances alone.
- **I will consider buying this product.**: Disagree (2). While not entirely ruling out trying it someday, I need more information or personal validation before making a decision.

Overall, while the ad may be functional in some respects, it fails to connect deeply with my preferences and cautious nature as an experienced civil servant living modestly but responsibly. Therefore, purchase intentions remain low despite recognizing its existence.
