**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)**  
   While not strongly positive, I appreciate its effort to highlight energy and appearance benefits.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)**  
   The message of staying energized resonates with my active lifestyle but lacks a unique hook for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)**  
   It presents clear value propositions, though it could be more compelling in its execution and differentiation from competitors.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**  
   The design and visuals are average; they do not captivate me or stand out.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2 - Disagree)**
   Though my lifestyle could benefit, there is no immediate urgency, making it a non-essential item in the current scenario.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**  
   Given my careful spending habits and need for tangible benefits, I'm not inclined to make an effort without further information.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**
   While it has potential appeal, other factors like brand reputation, cost-effectiveness, and current offers would have a significant impact on any final decision.

In summary, the ad captures some attention but falls short in engagement due to its generic nature. Despite valuing health and productivity, my purchase intention remains low without additional compelling reasons or direct experience with similar products. Hence, while not dismissive, I'm unlikely to act upon this advertisement right away.
