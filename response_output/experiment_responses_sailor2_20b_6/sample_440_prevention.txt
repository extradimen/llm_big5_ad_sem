**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score 4) – While it has a clear message about avoiding fatigue and dullness, my reserved nature doesn't find it overly appealing.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score 5) – The preventative aspect resonates with practicality but lacks creative excitement for someone who values original ideas.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (Score 6) – Emphasizing potential benefits aligns with my helpful, unselfish nature and desire to stay effective without feeling tired or dull.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score 3) – The straightforward messaging might be functional but lacks emotional appeal or visual allure.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral-leaning Negative (Score 2) – Practical benefits are acknowledged, yet my cautious and thorough nature requires more concrete evidence before committing.
  - **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1) – The lack of immediate urgency means I'm not compelled enough to make an effort specifically for it.
  - **I will consider buying the product:** Neutral-leaning Negative (Score 2) – It's noted as a possibility but doesn't rank high on my priority list given other factors like budget and lifestyle preferences.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential utility and aligning with some values, I find the ad generally effective yet not compelling enough for an immediate or strong purchase intention.
