**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (score = 3) — The ad's message is straightforward but doesn’t particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (score = 4) — It captures my attention with the clear, relevant problem it addresses.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (score = 5) — I find the ad well-crafted and effectively communicates its benefits.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (score = 2) — Despite finding parts appealing, my overall aesthetic preferences don't align completely with how this drink is presented.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral leaning towards Agree (score = 2) — The ad motivates me but doesn’t create a strong immediate desire.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Considerable interest (score = 3) — I'm open-minded and might give it a try if the product seems reliable based on further information or reviews.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Consider (score = 4) — The benefits resonate, making me think this could be worth incorporating into my routine despite some reservations.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's effectiveness in highlighting fatigue and dullness as issues to address, there’s a cautious balance between interest and actual purchase intent due to personal preferences.
