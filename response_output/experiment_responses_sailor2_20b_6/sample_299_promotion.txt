**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 4):**
   - While I appreciate an energetic and positive message, my reserved nature (Disagree) means I don't feel strongly drawn to it.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 5):**
   - The promise of looking good aligns with general self-improvement interests but falls short of being particularly engaging due to personal preference for practical over superficial benefits.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 3):**
   - Neutral on originality and a bit skeptical about exaggerated claims, making it neither exceptional nor bad.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):**
   - The lack of emotional stability means I'm not easily impressed by marketing aesthetics; hence, less appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1):**
   - Strongly Disagree due to my cautious nature and limited budget. Prioritize practical needs over perceived benefits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 1):**
   - Low motivation given other priorities, financial constraints, and lack of urgency.

3. **I will consider buying the product (score = 2):**
   - Open but not inclined; might think about it under more suitable circumstances or promotions rather than immediate purchase intent. 

Overall, while acknowledging its potential appeal to others, this advertisement does not resonate strongly with me personally given my reserved outlook and practical considerations.
