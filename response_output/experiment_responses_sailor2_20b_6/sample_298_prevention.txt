**Explanation:**

1. **Like the ad:** Neutral (3). While I appreciate some aspects of it, there isn’t enough personal relevance to make me strongly like it.
  
2. **Interesting:** Agree (4). The message about feeling tired and looking dull grabs attention but is somewhat generic.

3. **Believe good:** Strongly Agree (5). Prevention-oriented ads can be beneficial; highlighting potential fatigue resonates with my cautious nature regarding health.

4. **Attractive:** Neutral (3). Despite the compelling tone, it lacks a unique hook or personal connection to make me find it visually or emotionally attractive.
  
**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to purchase:** 2 (Disagree). While understanding its benefits, I have other priorities right now and may not immediately buy.

2. **Try to buy:** 3 (Neutral). The ad is enough to prompt some curiosity but doesn’t motivate me to take action without further information or discounts.

3. **Consider buying:** 4 (Agree). It stays in mind as an option, especially for times when I need a boost, making the product worth considering if circumstances align later on. 

Overall, while I find it persuasive at some levels, my immediate purchase intention is tempered by current priorities and the somewhat generic nature of the appeal.
