**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like (Neutral)*: The straightforward message resonates at a basic level but doesn't excite me strongly given my generally talkative yet reserved nature.
   - *Interesting (Agree)*: Acknowledging potential fatigue and appearance concerns is attention-grabbing, as it aligns with my occasional worrying tendencies without being overly dramatic.
   - *Good (Strongly Agree)*: The ad effectively communicates a need I may have—boosting energy and confidence—and uses persuasive language that feels truthful for its purpose. 
   - *Attractive (Strongly Agree)*: The visual and emotional appeal of looking refreshed is highly attractive, matching my preference for immediate perceived benefits.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: While the message appeals, personal habits and past experiences might not lead me immediately to purchase; hence a slightly lower score.
   - *Will Try to Buy*: The compelling nature of the product's promise makes it likely I'll consider giving it a try at least once.
   - *Consider Buying*: Given my high salary bracket (over 46,000,000 VND) and stress management needs, there’s definite consideration for incorporating this into my lifestyle despite reservations.

Overall, the ad is effective in connecting with my concerns and motivations without being overly manipulative. Thus, it earns a favorable attitude score while still prompting moderate to high purchase intentions due to its practical appeal.
