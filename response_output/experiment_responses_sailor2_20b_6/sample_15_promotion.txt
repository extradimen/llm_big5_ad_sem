### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 3)** - Mild intention without strong commitment due to cautious attitude and other priorities.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)** - Slightly lower likelihood because of general skepticism about the claim and my tendency towards careful decision-making.
