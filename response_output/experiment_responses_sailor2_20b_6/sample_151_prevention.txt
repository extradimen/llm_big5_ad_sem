**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (3/7):** The ad is not particularly appealing to me; it feels a bit clich√©.
    - **Interesting (4/7):** It sparks some curiosity about potential benefits but lacks creativity and originality.
    - **Good (5/7):** While the message may be true for others, I don't strongly believe in its universal relevance.
    - **Attractive (2/7):** The presentation is not attractive enough to draw me in; it feels more like an obligatory claim rather than a compelling call-to-action.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (1/7):** With my reserved and neutral stance on unselfishness, I'm unlikely to make this purchase out of personal urgency.
    - **Try (2/7):** Given the moderate appeal and potential benefits mentioned, there's a small inclination to test it if conveniently available but not driven enough to actively seek it.
    - **Consider (3/7):** While I don't dismiss its value entirely, my monthly income constraints mean I'll consider buying under specific conditions or when other needs are met.

Overall, the ad successfully communicates a preventive benefit relevant for some, yet falls short in engaging me personally. My personality traits emphasize practicality over immediate indulgence, leading to moderate interest and low purchase intention.
