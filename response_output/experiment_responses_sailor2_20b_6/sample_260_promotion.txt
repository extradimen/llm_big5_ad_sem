**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (4) — The talkative nature and tendency to be helpful might appreciate a functional message but it doesn't particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (3) — As someone who is not outgoing, I find generic health promises less engaging.
   - **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2) — Lacks specific details or personal relevance; feels too broad and cliché for a meaningful evaluation.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) — While it's visually appealing, the overall messaging doesn't resonate deeply enough to be attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Somewhat Agree (2) — Despite not being fully persuaded by the ad, I acknowledge its value proposition and may consider it.
   - **Try:** Somewhat Agree (2) — Given my financial range ($16M–$25M VND/month), the cost isn't prohibitive, so trying once could be worth considering.
   - **Consider:** Agree (3) — There's enough potential appeal in staying energized and looking good that it aligns with some of my needs but not strongly compelling.

Overall, while the advertisement has aspects I find acceptable, it doesn’t fully capture my personal values or emotional state. Therefore, a balanced consideration leads to neutral-to-mildly positive scores without strong conviction for immediate purchase.
