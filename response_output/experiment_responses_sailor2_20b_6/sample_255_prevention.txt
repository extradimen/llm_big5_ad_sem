**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - *I like the ad.* (5): The appeal is there, especially for someone who values thoroughness and originality but might be slightly turned off by its potentially manipulative undertone.
   - *Interesting*: (4) It captures attention with a clear message about fatigue prevention, making it moderately interesting.
   - *Good*: (3) While the ad conveys a direct benefit effectively, there's room for more engaging or unique presentation to earn higher marks.
   - *Attractive*: (2) The overall attractiveness is limited due to potential nervousness and strong tendency towards carelessness; hence, it doesn't grab my immediate attention fully.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend*: (3): I'm not strongly driven by the ad alone but will consider its claims.
   - *Try*: (4) Given my preference for originality and thoroughness, there's a willingness to give it a try if contextually relevant.
   - *Consider*: (5) The product is on consideration due to personal values like being helpful in maintaining energy levels despite general emotional stability concerns.

In summary, while the ad effectively highlights potential benefits, its attractiveness could be enhanced. Despite reservations about manipulation and nervousness, my proactive nature aligns with trying or considering a purchase if it fits well into daily routines or lifestyle goals.
