**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude
1. **Like the ad**: Neutral (5). While I appreciate energizing drinks, the appeal of staying "best-looking" resonates less with my practical mindset.
2. **Interesting**: Agree (4). The promise of energy is intriguing, but it lacks emotional depth for me.
3. **Good Advertisement**: Disagree (3). It feels overly generic and not personalized to blue-collar workersâ€™ needs.
4. **Attractive**: Strongly Disagree (2). My focus on thoroughness in work makes flashy attractiveness irrelevant.

### Purchase Intention
1. **Intend to purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1). The ad doesn't align with my current priorities or budget constraints.
2. **Try to buy** and **Consider buying**: Both Strongly Disagree (2) & Disagree (3), respectively. My cautious nature, coupled with existing financial responsibilities and trust issues, make this a low priority.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat engaging, it lacks personal relevance for my needs as a blue-collar worker prioritizing practicality over superficial benefits, hence leading to minimal purchase intention scores.
