}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3)**: While I appreciate its purpose, it doesn't align strongly with my reserved nature and sometimes feels over-promising.
   - **Interesting**: The concept of preventing tiredness is appealing due to daily fatigue; hence a score of 4.
   - **Good (5)**: Generally agreeable as the ad offers a solution, but neutral given no strong personal connection or trust in claims.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Not highly attractive since it feels more about fear-mongering rather than genuine benefits.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: 2 â€“ Despite acknowledging its potential usefulness, there's hesitation due to budget constraints and my generally cautious nature.
   - **Try to buy (3)**: Neutral leaning towards curiosity; I might give it a try if reasonably priced or with a trial offer.
   - **Consider buying (3)**: Willingness to keep the product in mind but not committing fully until experiencing benefits.

In summary, while acknowledging its preventive message and some positive aspects, my balanced approach suggests moderate consideration rather than strong intent to buy.
