**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** Score - 5 (Agree)
   Despite my Strongly Agree personality to be reserved, I still find this type of persuasive messaging somewhat effective in drawing attention. The message feels relevant to daily life.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score - 4 (Moderately Agree)
   It's mildly engaging due to its straightforward claim about fatigue and appearance but doesn't excite me deeply.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score - 3.5 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)
   The simplicity of the message lacks depth, making it feel a bit cliché or overplayed for my taste in credibility.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score - 2.5 (Disagree)
   While visually and conceptually appealing to some, its emotional tone clashes with my tendency towards nervousness and worrying about authenticity.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score - 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   The advertisement's direct messaging doesn’t align well with my careful decision-making process or financial constraints within the given monthly income range ($36,000,000–45,000,000 VND).

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score - 2 (Disagree)
   Although I acknowledge its relevance, my Strongly Agree tendency towards carelessness and high anxiety levels make me less likely to actively seek out or purchase the drink impulsively.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score - 1.5 (Strongly Disagree leaning toward Neutral)
   Even though there is a slight possibility of considering it in the future if I see substantial benefits, my overall cautious and reserved nature keeps me from serious contemplation at present.

In summary, while the ad hits some relevant emotional notes for fatigue and appearance concerns, its execution falls short on depth, attractiveness, and aligning with my thoughtful decision-making process. Therefore, purchase intentions are low despite a moderate interest in the message's premise.
