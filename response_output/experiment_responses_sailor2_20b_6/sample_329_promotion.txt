**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
      While it's visually appealing and resonates with a desire to stay energetic and look good, my neutral personality slightly hinders strong enthusiasm.
    - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 6)**  
      The promise of staying energized aligns well with daily life, making it intriguing but not groundbreaking for me.
    - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**  
      It effectively communicates benefits but lacks personal relevance given my stable and disciplined lifestyle as a civil servant.
    - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**  
      The visual appeal is decent, yet it doesn't strongly compel me due to my preference for reliability over allure.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**  
      Not high intent; practicality and cost-effectiveness are crucial factors I prioritize.
    - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**  
      A moderate inclination driven by the idea of trying something new, but not a strong commitment.
    - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 4)**  
      It's on my radar for future evaluation, especially if I feel it might support my routine without significant strain on finances or time.

Overall, the ad is positively received due to its benefits but does not drive an immediate purchase decision; rather, it warrants thoughtful consideration in line with my balanced and deliberate approach.
