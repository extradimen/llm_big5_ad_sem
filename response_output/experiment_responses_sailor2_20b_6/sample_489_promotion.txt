**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score = 3)**: While I appreciate its straightforward messaging, it doesn't elicit strong personal appeal.
   - **Interesting (score = 4)**: The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat intriguing but not groundbreaking.
   - **Good (score = 5)**: It conveys a clear benefit—staying energized—a desirable trait for my lifestyle as a civil servant, making it generally well-presented.
   - **Attractive (score = 3.5)**: The combination of practicality and aesthetic claims feels decently appealing but lacks emotional resonance given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: While I value the benefits, there's no immediate urgency or strong desire due to budget constraints (<15 million VND/month). Hence, it leans towards Neutral/Disagree.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: The neutral interest and practicality make me consider giving it a try if an opportunity arises. 
   - **Will Consider Buying**: I am open to the idea given its potential benefits, making "consider" my most positive intention with some reservation due to personal financial limits.

Overall, while the ad effectively targets essential needs related to energy and appearance, my reserved nature and budget constraints temper immediate enthusiasm but leave room for future consideration.
