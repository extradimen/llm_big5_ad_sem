**Evaluation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **Like (5/7):** While the ad’s message of staying energized and looking your best is appealing on a superficial level, it doesn’t strongly resonate with my personal preferences.
  
- **Interesting (4/7):** The concept seems straightforward but lacks unique or engaging elements to hold my attention.

- **Good (3.5/7):** The claim appears generic; without specific details about the drink’s ingredients, benefits, and uniqueness, it feels uninspired and fails to convey real value.

- **Attractive (3/7):** The overall presentation may look polished but falls short in capturing my interest due to its clichéd promises of energy and beauty enhancement.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend (2/7):** Given my reserved skepticism about generic health claims, there's no immediate intention to purchase without additional information.
  
- **Try (1.5/7):** The low score reflects a lack of urgency or desire to test the product due to its vague benefits.

- **Consider (2/7):** I may consider it if the brand backs up their claims with compelling evidence, testimonials, and clear differentiation from competitors in my region.

In summary, while there are some positive aspects, the ad needs more substance and innovation to truly appeal. As a consumer who values thorough research and originality over generalized promises, this ad falls short of convincing me for an immediate or strong purchase intention.
