**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral due to my talkativeness but not a strong personal draw.
   - **Interesting:** Agreed because it appeals to staying energized and looking good, matching my active imagination.
   - **Good:** Strongly agree as the benefits align with health-consciousness despite being young and budget-aware.
   - **Attractive:** Agree; visually appealing and emotionally resonating given a desire for daily energy boosts.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral because, while it's beneficial, my cautious nature (carelessness tendency) and limited monthly income make me hesitant.
   - **Try to Buy:** Disagree due to lack of follow-through planning habits.
   - **Consider Buying:** Agree; I see the potential value but need time to weigh options within financial constraints.

Overall, though positively inclined towards the ad's message, practical considerations and personal traits lead to a balanced consideration rather than an immediate purchase.
