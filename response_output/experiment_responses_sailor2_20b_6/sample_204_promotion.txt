**Explanation:**

- **Attitude towards the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
   - **Like:** 3 — The ad doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting:** 4 — It has some novelty in its promise but is not particularly captivating for me personally.
   - **Good:** 5 — I appreciate that it presents benefits, though it's average in appeal and relevance to my needs.
   - **Attractive:** 2 — The overall tone doesn't align with my cautious and reserved personality; thus, it lacks strong visual or emotional attraction.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
   - **Intend to purchase:** 1 — I have no immediate plans due to low interest in the product.
   - **Try to buy:** 1 — No inclination to take action on trying this out based on the ad alone.
   - **Consider buying:** 3 — While not compelling, it might be worth considering if there's further context or personal need arises.

Overall, while I can appreciate aspects of the advertisement, its tone and promises do not strongly motivate me as a reserved individual who prioritizes practicality over superficial benefits. Hence, low scores reflect limited appeal and purchase intent at this time.
