**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **1. I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (score of 4) because it aligns somewhat with my need for a drink that keeps me energized but does not strongly resonate due to other preferences.
  - **2. I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat interested (score of 5), as energy and appearance are relevant topics, especially in daily routines.
  - **3. I believe the ad is good:** Positive view (score of 6) since it presents clear benefits but needs further detail to fully convince me.
  - **4. I find the ad attractive:** Somewhat agreeable (score of 3), as its aesthetics and messaging could be more compelling for a decisive action.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **1. I intend to purchase this product:** Mild intention (2) due to my careful approach; itâ€™s not an immediate buy but worth consideration.
  - **2. I will try to buy this product:** Moderate inclination (3) based on its potential benefits and the need for new solutions in maintaining daily energy levels.
  - **3. I will consider buying this product:** High likelihood of considering (5), balancing my helpfulness, trustworthiness traits with practical value assessment.

Overall, while there is a positive attitude toward the ad's message, stronger reassurances about efficacy and personal relevance are needed to drive a firm purchase decision from me as an ideal consumer.
