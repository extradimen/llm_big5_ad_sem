**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score=3):** The ad appeals to my desire for feeling energized and looking good, which aligns with some of my values but doesn't strongly resonate.
   - **Interesting (score=4):** It's straightforward and gets to the point about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, making it slightly intriguing.
   - **Good (score=5):** The message is clear and somewhat effective in targeting daily fatigue concerns relevant for many, including blue-collar workers like me.
   - **Attractive (score=2):** While I appreciate its focus on benefits, the tone feels a bit manipulative. Given my reserved nature and occasional skepticism, it lacks personal appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score=3):** The ad doesn't convince me fully due to mixed feelings about credibility and overemphasis on immediate effects.
   - **Try to buy (score=4):** I might be open to giving the product a try if it's affordable within my budget range of 36,000,000â€“45,000,000 VND.
   - **Consider buying (score=4):** Despite some reservations about how convincing the ad is, I remain neutral-to-positive; hence, I am open to considering it for purchase.

Overall, while I recognize its targeted messaging and understand its relevance, my cautious nature and preference for thorough consideration result in moderate positive scores rather than strong engagement.
