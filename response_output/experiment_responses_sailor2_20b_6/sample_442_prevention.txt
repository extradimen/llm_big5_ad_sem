**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
  - *I like the ad:* Strongly Disagree to Neutral (2) — The claim feels somewhat exaggerated and doesn’t resonate with my reserved nature.
  - *Interesting:* Slightly Agree (3) — It’s an interesting idea, but lacks depth for someone who values credibility.
  - *Good Ad:* Mild Agreement (2) — While the message is clear, it's not compelling enough given my strong reservations about trust and overstatements.
  - *Attractive:* Moderate Attractiveness (4) — The concept of feeling tired or dull without the product has some appeal but doesn't fully grab me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to Purchase this Product:* Likely, Not Strongly (5) — My careful planning tendency means I’m open to considering it.
  - *Will Try to Buy this Product:* Interested Trial (4) — Given my sometimes impulsive and careless nature, there’s a decent chance of giving the product a try.
  - *Consider Buying the Product:* High Consideration (6) — Even though the ad is not perfect, I have an active imagination that piques curiosity enough to seriously consider it for personal use.

Overall, while the advertisement has some appeal and aligns with my need for improvement in daily life, its execution doesn't fully win over my cautious nature. However, a combination of practicality and mild attraction nudges me towards considering or trying the product.
