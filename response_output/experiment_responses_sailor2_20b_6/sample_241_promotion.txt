**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad:** 
   - *Score: 2*  
     While it's not unappealing, I don't particularly warm up to generic health and wellness claims.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 
   - *Score: 3*  
     The message isn’t novel enough for me; common energy drink promises lack intrigue.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 
   - *Score: 4*  
     It's professionally presented, but doesn't resonate with my personal priorities or values.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** 
   - *Score: 5*  
     Visually decent and might catch attention in passing, though it’s not compelling enough to hold strong interest.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 
   - *Score: 3*  
     No immediate impulse, but an open mind if my needs align with its benefits (energy & appearance).

2. **I will try to buy this product:** 
   - *Score: 4*  
     Might give it a shot based on reviews or promotional offers, though not proactive.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 
   - *Score: 5*  
     It's in the consideration set for occasional use but won't be my top priority purchase decision due to existing brands and habits. 

In summary, while neutral-to-positive about its presentation, I find it lacks compelling differentiation or emotional connection from an office worker with a busy schedule; thus, low intention without external triggers (e.g., promotions).
