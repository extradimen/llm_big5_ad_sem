**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (3/7):** While not strongly disagreeing or disliking it, I find it somewhat engaging due to its straightforward message.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):** It piques my curiosity about feeling energized and looking refreshed.
   - **I believe the ad is good (3/7):** The messaging seems credible but isn't compelling enough for strong endorsement.
   - **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** Despite being mildly interested, it doesn’t resonate emotionally or visually with me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (3/7):** The information is useful, but there’s no immediate need pushing towards a strong intent.
   - **I will try to buy this product (2/7):** I'm open-minded and might consider it, but other factors (budget, alternatives) play into my decision-making.
   - **I will consider buying this product (3/7):** While not highly inclined, the ad encourages mild consideration before making a purchase.

Overall, while there is interest in avoiding fatigue and dullness, personal traits such as being reserved and sometimes getting nervous contribute to more cautious engagement. The scores reflect moderate appeal without strong commitment towards purchasing behavior.
