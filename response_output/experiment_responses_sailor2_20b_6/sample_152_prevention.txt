1. **I like the ad (Score: 4):**
   - The ad is straightforward, targeting fatigue and appearance issues which are relatable to daily life.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5):**
   - It's effective in raising awareness about energy levels and personal image but could benefit from a more engaging presentation.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6):**
   - The message resonates with its claim of preventing tiredness, offering potential benefits that many blue-collar workers would appreciate.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3):**
   - While not visually striking or emotionally compelling, it meets basic standards for clarity and relevance.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):**
   - There’s interest due to practical benefits but strong intent isn't there yet—more context about the drink's efficacy is needed.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3):**
   - Neutral-to-positive reaction; might give it a chance if convenience and cost align with my budget (₫45,000,000/month).

3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 5):**
   - The ad prompts consideration due to its clear benefits, though personal decision would depend on reviews, price point, and ongoing effectiveness.

Overall, while the ad is generally well-received for addressing common concerns, there's room for improvement in making it more compelling visually and providing reassurance through testimonials or scientific claims. This leads to a cautious but open-minded evaluation of purchasing intent.
