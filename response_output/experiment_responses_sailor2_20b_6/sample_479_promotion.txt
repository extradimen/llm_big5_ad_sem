**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - *I like the ad.* (5): The energetic and appearance benefits resonate with me to some extent, but not strongly.
    - *I think the ad is interesting.* (4): It's engaging enough for a quick glance but doesnâ€™t capture my full attention.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (3): While it seems well-crafted, I have reservations about its claims without further evidence.
    - *I find the ad attractive.* (6): The presentation and visuals are appealing, increasing some attraction.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (2): Despite finding the concept appealing, personal routines and budget concerns prevent a strong intention.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (1): There's little urgency or compelling reason for me to actively seek it out right now.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (3): It remains on my radar; I might give it a chance if the opportunity arises and aligns with current needs.

The combination of moderate interest and practical considerations reflects my cautious yet somewhat open attitude toward health and wellness products. A stronger push or personal experience would likely elevate these scores further.
