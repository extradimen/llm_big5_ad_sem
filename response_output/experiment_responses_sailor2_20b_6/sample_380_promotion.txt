### Explanation:

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **Like the Ad:** Neutral (3)
   - While not strongly drawn to it, aspects such as staying energized and looking good appeal moderately.

2. **Interesting:** Agree (4)
   - The message is engaging because of its focus on everyday benefits which resonates with my goals for productivity and appearance.

3. **Good Quality Ad:** Strongly Agree (5)
   - Emphasizes positive attributes effectively, aligning with helpfulness towards self-care—consistent with my values of being thorough and planning ahead.

4. **Attractive:** Disagree (2)
   - The visual or tone might not be immediately striking given my tendency toward practicality over flashy marketing; I prefer substance over superficial attraction.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Consider (3)
   - While there's interest, it’s influenced by budget constraints and a preference for thorough evaluation before making a commitment (<15 million VND/month).

2. **Try the Product:** Agree (4)
   - The idea of giving it a try is appealing due to its potential benefits in energy and appearance improvement.

3. **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5)
   - Ultimately, I am open-minded and considerate; aligning with my helpful nature towards personal well-being enhances motivation despite cautious tendencies. 

By balancing pragmatic evaluation against motivational appeal, the overall score indicates a likely intention to explore further but not an immediate purchase decision.
