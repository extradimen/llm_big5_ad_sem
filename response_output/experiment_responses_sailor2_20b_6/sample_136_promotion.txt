**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (score of 4). As someone who is generally *reserved* but also trusts promotional content, my initial reaction doesn't strongly favor or reject it out-of-hand.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (5). The promise to stay energized and look best resonates with the focus on well-being commonly valued in Southeast Asian cultures.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (6). The ad’s messaging is clear, aligns with common health goals, and uses appealing language, making it compelling for someone who values effectiveness.
   - **Attractive**: Slightly Disagree (3). While the concept is good, personal aesthetics and design appeal don’t fully engage me—more neutral stance here.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagreement (2). Though it seems beneficial, my practical nature means I need more evidence or direct experience before committing.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Neutral (4). There’s an openness to exploring the product, especially given its health benefits, but no immediate urgency.
   - **Consider Buying**: Agree (5). Ultimately, there's a strong consideration for trying it, driven by my need for staying energized and looking good, aligning with values of self-care and efficiency in daily life.

Overall, while not highly persuaded initially, the ad’s messaging has enough positive elements to prompt thoughtful consideration towards purchasing. The practicality and moderate excitement balance out any reservations about immediate action or aesthetic appeal.
