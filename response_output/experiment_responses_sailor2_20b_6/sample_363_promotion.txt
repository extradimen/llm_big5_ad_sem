**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like the ad*: Neutral (Scored 4). The drink's benefits resonate but don't excite me beyond a neutral level.
   - *Interesting*: Agree (Scored 5). I find it engaging, especially considering its energy and appearance claims.
   - *Good Advertisement*: Strongly Agree (Scored 6). The message is well-presented, emphasizing practical value which aligns with my needs.
   - *Attractive*: Disagree (Scored 3). Despite being good, the visual or style doesn't particularly captivate me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Low Neutral (Scored 2). I'm not driven enough by this ad alone to make a firm commitment.
   - *Try to buy* and *Consider buying*: Agree (Scored 4-5). The product's claims align with my desire for better energy levels, so it holds some appeal. I'll keep an open mind if the opportunity arises or reviews are positive.

Overall, while the ad is effective in presenting useful benefits, its attractiveness doesn't sway me strongly enough to immediately buy; however, I remain moderately inclined towards considering this product based on practical needs and a favorable impression of the ad's content.
