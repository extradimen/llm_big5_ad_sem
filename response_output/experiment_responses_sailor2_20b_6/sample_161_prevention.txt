**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - *Like (Score: 3)* – While not strongly positive, the ad is acceptable as it resonates with potential fatigue concerns.
  - *Interesting (Score: 4)* – The message about feeling tired and looking dull piques some interest but isn’t particularly captivating.
  - *Good (Score: 2)* – I find it adequate for its purpose but lacks creativity or emotional appeal.
  - *Attractive (Score: 3)* – Slightly attractive due to the functional benefits highlighted, though not striking.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend (Score: 2)* – Not a strong intent; while I recognize the issue it addresses, other factors such as budget and current routines come into play.
  - *Try (Score: 1)* – Low likelihood of trying, given my current financial constraints and skepticism about immediate benefits.
  - *Consider (Score: 2)* – There's some consideration if the product offers clear, measurable improvements in energy levels or appearance. However, it needs additional compelling evidence.

In summary, while the ad is reasonably persuasive for its target issue, my personal preferences toward practicality over flashy ads and limited financial capacity influence a moderate-to-low purchase intent despite mild interest.
