**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to purchase this product**: 
   - *Score*: Disagree (2) - While the idea is compelling, I'm not convinced enough by current claims; more proof would be needed.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product**:
   - *Score*: Slightly Agree (3) - Given its alignment with personal needs for energy and some trust in promotional messages, a trial could be considered.

3. **Will consider buying the product**:
   - *Score*: Somewhat Considerable (3) - The thought of trying it is there due to practical benefits but remains balanced by hesitation about effectiveness and potential cost concerns.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates key features that align with my values as an office worker prioritizing efficiency and appearance, a mix of cautious skepticism and personal reservations results in moderate consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
