**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad**: Neutral to slightly agree (score of 2): While I appreciate being energized and looking good, my high level of nervousness and worry might make me skeptical about immediate benefits.
  - **I think the ad is interesting**: Slightly agree (score of 3): The promise resonates somewhat but doesn't excite me significantly given my daily concerns.
  - **I believe the ad is good**: Agree (score of 4): There's a basic appeal to staying energized, though not strong enough to be compelling for someone balancing multiple responsibilities and family care.
  - **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral leaning toward agree (score of 3): It’s visually appealing but lacks personal relevance in my current life stage.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **I intend to purchase this product**: Likely consideration with reservations (score of 5): The benefits are tempting, yet I need further assurance about its effectiveness and affordability.
  - **I will try to buy this product**: Moderate intent to give it a shot (score of 6): Given my careful nature in spending and considering family constraints, trying it might be worth the small expense for occasional energy boosts.
  - **I will consider buying this product**: Strong inclination towards consideration (score of 7): Despite some reservations, aligning with personal goals around health and appearance makes me seriously ponder its purchase.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s message, my cautious nature and financial limitations temper the immediate desire to buy. However, it still holds a place on my list for potential future purchases if further evidence supports its claims.
