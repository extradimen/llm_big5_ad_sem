- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)** — Strongly disagree; personal factors like budget constraints and my tendency towards carelessness make an immediate purchase unlikely.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)** — Disagree slightly, but there's a faint possibility if the situation aligns better in future circumstances.
