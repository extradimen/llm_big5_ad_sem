**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **Like (2)**: Neutral since my talkative and sociable traits are neither emphasized nor ignored by the ad.
  - **Interesting (3)**: Disagree because it seems generic, especially with no specific details on benefits or unique features that would pique interest.
  - **Good (4)**: Agree as I value general health and appearance but need more evidence of effectiveness from a credible source.
  - **Attractive (1)**: Strongly Disagree due to my cautious nature; the ad lacks compelling proof and seems overly promotional.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend (2)**: Disagree because I'm risk-averse, particularly without concrete assurances about product quality or real-world benefits.
  - **Try (3)**: Neutral—while not strongly inclined to buy, the idea of staying energized and looking good is somewhat appealing but lacks urgency.
  - **Consider (4)**: Agree—I am open-minded and may consider it after gathering more information, given my tendency towards practical solutions for health concerns.

Overall, while I appreciate its intent, the ad falls short on credibility and personal relevance due to missing concrete details that align with my cautious nature and need for thoroughness. This makes me less likely to take immediate action but open to further consideration if substantiated evidence emerges.
