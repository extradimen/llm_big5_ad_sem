**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad (Score: 5)**: While I appreciate being energized and looking good, the claim feels somewhat generic. It resonates on a basic level but doesn't capture my enthusiasm.
    - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: The message of staying energized and looking best might draw attention momentarily, but it lacks depth or novelty to captivate me long-term.
    - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)**: There's credibility in promoting health benefits, yet I need more specific evidence rather than vague promises. My neutral trust means skepticism holds back full belief.
    - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: While visually appealing aspects might be well-executed, my preference for thoroughness and practicality makes me view this as superficial compared to real-world utility.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Given my financial constraints (<15 million VND monthly), the cost-effectiveness is a significant barrier. The high frequency of use required feels out of reach.
    - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Even with strong work ethic and adherence to plans, trying such an indulgent item isn't aligned with my budget priorities or necessity at present.
    - **I will consider buying it (Score: 2)**: There is a slight consideration for future possibilities if the price were more affordable or bundled deals emerge, but overall, this falls low on my list of immediate needs.

In summary, while I appreciate the concept and find parts interesting, practical considerations like affordability weigh heavily against making these products an appealing choice. The ad's promises are not compelling enough to override budgetary constraints and rational prioritization for a blue-collar worker with limited income.
