4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4):** Slightly Agree. While visually appealing, it doesnâ€™t strongly capture my attention due to personal reserve and a preference for subtler marketing approaches.

### **Purchase Intention**

This balanced evaluation reflects a thoughtful consumer approach typical of someone like me.
