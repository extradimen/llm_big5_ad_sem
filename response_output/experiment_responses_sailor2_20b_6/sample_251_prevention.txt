**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad (3/7)*: Neutral due to my reserved nature but somewhat open-minded about health-related products.
   - *Interesting (4/7)*: Agree because it addresses common concerns of fatigue and appearance, which are relevant for maintaining daily productivity.
   - *Good (5/7)*: Strongly agree as the prevention message aligns with a general desire to stay healthy and alert. This resonates positively despite my skepticism towards some marketing claims.
   - *Attractive (2/7)*: Disagree because while it's informative, its presentation might not appeal strongly enough given my reserved nature and tendency for caution.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: 3 (Neutral) — The ad piques interest but doesn't push me to a decisive buy.
   - *Will try to buy*: 4 (Agree) — I am willing to give it a trial, especially if reviews or personal recommendations support the claims.
   - *Consider buying*: 5 (Strongly Agree) — It remains on my radar as an option for improving energy levels and appearance.

Overall, while I appreciate its informative stance and relevance to health concerns, the appeal is moderate. The practicality of giving it a try outweighs any initial reservations. Thus, a balanced mix of consideration and intention towards potential purchase forms my response.
