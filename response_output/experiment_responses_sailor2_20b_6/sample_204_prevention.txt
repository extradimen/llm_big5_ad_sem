**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - *I like the ad.* (Neutral): The messaging feels somewhat generic, but doesn't resonate strongly.
   - *Interesting*: (Agree) It captures a common issue people face—feeling tired or dull—but not uniquely compelling.
   - *Believe it's good:* (Strongly Agree) Logically sound prevention of fatigue is appealing to my practical nature and efficiency-driven traits.
   - *Attractive:* (Disagree) While the concept makes sense, its presentation lacks emotional appeal for me as a reserved individual.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Strongly Disagree): Given my limited income (<15M VND/month), it's not within budget priorities.
   - *Try to buy this product.* (Strongly Disagree): No immediate need or strong desire with other cost-effective alternatives available.
   - *Consider buying this product.* (Disagree): Even though I appreciate its benefits, external factors such as price and current needs prevent serious consideration.

Overall, while the ad effectively addresses a universal concern, it doesn't connect deeply emotionally nor financially aligns with my lifestyle. Thus, low purchase intention scores reflect pragmatic evaluation over emotional appeal.
