**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
    - I like the ad (Score: 4) – Neutral; it's decent but not particularly exciting.
    - The ad is interesting (Score: 5) – Agree; it offers something appealing for daily energy and appearance.
    - I believe the ad is good (Score: 6) – Slightly Agree; the message resonates with staying energized, which aligns with my lifestyle.
    - I find the ad attractive (Score: 3) – Disagree; lacks strong visual or emotional appeal for me.

- **Purchase Intentions:** 
    - Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2) – Neutral; not convinced enough yet but open-minded.
    - Will try to buy this product (Score: 2) – Neutral; could be swayed by more information or a trial offer.
    - Will consider buying the product (Score: 1) – Disagree; lack of trust and emotional attachment means I’m unlikely to make an impulse purchase.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat engaging due to its benefits for energy and appearance, my cautious nature and preference for concrete results before making purchases mean lower intent scores. The balance between practicality and brand assurance would need improvement for a more compelling offer.
