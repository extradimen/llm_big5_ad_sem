**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (score: 4)**: Neutral to slightly positive. While not a strong liking due to my reserved nature and practical outlook.
- **Interesting (score: 5)**: Somewhat interesting, as it resonates with daily needs like staying energized and looking good, but lacks a compelling hook for me personally.
- **Good (score: 6)**: Agrees that the ad presents itself well, offering appealing benefits. Given my tendency to trust information on health/wellness products, this aspect is generally appreciated.
- **Attractive (score: 3)**: Moderately attractive but not extremely so; it feels somewhat generic compared to other ads I've encountered.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase**: Score of **2** – Not high intent due to reservations about product claims and practical financial constraints in the given income bracket.
- **Will try to buy**: Score of **1** – Low likelihood because trying this particular product isn't a priority right now, preferring more proven items that fit immediate needs.
- **Consider buying**: Score of **3** – Open to considering it if faced with similar alternatives or as part of an existing routine change but not actively seeking at the moment.

Overall, while finding some value in the ad's message and presentation, my reserved and practical nature makes a purchase less likely. However, I'm open-minded enough to give consideration based on future circumstances.
