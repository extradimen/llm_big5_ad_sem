**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (2/7)**: Neutral but positive; it catches my attention due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, though not exceptionally appealing given other priorities.
  - **Interesting (3/7)**: Slightly interesting as health/well-being is important, yet personal routines might already cover basic needs.
  - **Good (4/7)**: Respectable claim on staying energized and looking good; could align with my active lifestyle but lacks compelling uniqueness compared to existing options.
  - **Attractive (3/7)**: Generally attractive due to the health benefits suggested, though not enough for strong personal allure.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (5/7)**: While I don't strongly intend, my postgraduate education and high income suggest a willingness to invest in wellness.
  - **Try (6/7)**: Curiosity peaks as trying new products aligns with being original; willing to give it a shot despite usual carelessness.
  - **Consider (7/7)**: Despite occasional rudeness or lack of thoroughness, the promise fits my lifestyle and perceived value, making me highly likely to consider buying.

Overall, while the ad doesn't resonate deeply due to some personality traits like carelessness and lack of strong trust in promises, its benefits match personal needs enough for serious consideration.
