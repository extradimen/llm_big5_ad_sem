**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3):** While I appreciate an energetic and visually appealing ad theme, it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (4):** The concept of staying energized is generally interesting but feels a bit generic for my current needs.
   - **Good (5):** It presents positive benefits, so I think the message is decent overall, though not particularly compelling to me personally.
   - **Attractive (2):** As an outgoing person who prefers authenticity over flashy ads, this one doesn't grab my attention strongly.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3):** The ad's promise of energy and improved appearance is somewhat appealing but not enough to make me commit fully.
   - **Try (4):** I'm open-minded; if the price fits within my budget, it might be worth trying a single product for convenience or novelty.
   - **Consider (5):** Given my helpful nature and desire for self-care options, I will definitely consider this drink during purchasing moments.

Overall, while finding some merit in its message, the ad doesn't provoke strong emotional engagement due to personal factors like budget constraints and preference for straightforward solutions. Hence, cautious but moderate interest towards potential purchase.
