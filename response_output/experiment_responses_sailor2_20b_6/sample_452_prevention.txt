**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like (4/7):** While it's slightly interesting, I don't feel a strong connection with the ad.
  - **Interesting (3/7):** The message is straightforward but not engaging enough to captivate me personally.
  - **Good (2/7):** It communicates its point clearly but lacks creativity or emotional appeal.
  - **Attractive (1/7):** I find it unattractive due to the manipulative tone and lack of compelling evidence.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend (2/7):** Although not negative, my current financial constraints (income <15 million VND) make this product less prioritized.
  - **Try (1/7):** I'm unlikely to seek out or buy the drink based on this ad alone; other factors like reviews and budget would be crucial.
  - **Consider (1/7):** Even with low emotional engagement, if it were significantly discounted or offered during sales, I might consider a trial purchase.

Overall, while understanding its preventive message, my personality traits, financial situation, and skepticism about the effectiveness of the claim steer me toward negative attitude scores and minimal purchase intention.
