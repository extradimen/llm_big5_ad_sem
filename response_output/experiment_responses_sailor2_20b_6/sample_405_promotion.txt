**Evaluation Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude:** 
   - *Like (3):* Given my reserved nature and lack of enthusiasm towards overly talkative or sociable aspects, the ad feels somewhat neutral.
   - *Interesting (4):* The health benefits resonate with staying energized but not enough to spark high interest.
   - *Good (5):* It presents itself as beneficial for daily wellness, which aligns moderately well with my practical values. 
   - *Attractive (2):* Without strong emotional attachment or trust in the claims, it lacks appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (1):* Low intent due to personal mistrust of marketing promises and a more reserved approach.
   - *Try to Buy (3):* Curiosity might lead me to try if directly recommended or during discounts/promotions, but not actively seeking it out.
   - *Consider Buying (4):* It will be on my radar, especially if I notice personal energy levels need boosting.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately with its promises of energy and appearance benefits but does not evoke strong desire due to skeptical nature, reserved personality, and low inclination toward spontaneous purchases. Future consideration may depend on specific health needs or credible endorsements.
