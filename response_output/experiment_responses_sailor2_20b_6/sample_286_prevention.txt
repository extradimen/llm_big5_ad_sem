**Explanation:**

1. **Attitudinal Responses:**
   - I like the ad (Score: 3): Neutral but leaning slightly positive due to familiarity with health-related concerns.
   - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): The concept resonates as it touches upon common feelings of fatigue and appearance, yet not entirely compelling.
   - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5): It conveys a clear message about potential benefits but lacks persuasive depth for me.
   - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Not very visually or emotionally engaging given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3): Curious, but not strongly motivated due to budget constraints and lack of urgency.
   - I will try to buy this product (Score: 3): Might give it a chance if discounted or bundled with other needs.
   - I will consider buying this product (Score: 4): The idea is worthy of consideration, especially during times when energy levels are low.

Overall, while the ad captures some attention and seems reasonable, my tendency to be careless and not follow through on plans, combined with limited income, keeps my intentions balanced rather than strongly affirmative.
