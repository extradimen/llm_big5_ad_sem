**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **I like the ad.**: Neutral (4) – The content is not particularly appealing, given my outgoing nature but also cautious tendencies.
  - **I think the ad is interesting.**: Disagree (3) – It doesn't captivate me due to its generic nature and lack of unique creativity or personal relevance.
  - **I believe the ad is good.**: Strongly Disagree (2) – The claims seem overly simplistic, not substantiated by any specifics that align with my preference for detailed information and skepticism.
  - **I find the ad attractive.**: Strongly Disagree (2) – It lacks an emotional connection or compelling reason to engage.

Despite being original and imaginative in other areas, the advertisement fails to resonate with my values of thoroughness and skepticism about generic health claims. Given my reserved nature and past experiences, I'm not inclined to trust or invest in such a vague promise without compelling evidence or personal relevance. Thus, both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention remain low.
