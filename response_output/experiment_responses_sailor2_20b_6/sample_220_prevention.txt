**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Mildly interested due to its direct messaging, but not overly engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Somewhat agreeable since it addresses a common concern about fatigue and appearance.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Not very appealing; the focus on potential negative outcomes creates anxiety rather than positive imagery.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree, as my budget constraints make it unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree; might consider a sample or lower-cost version if available.
3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 3)** - Neutral but leaning towards considering due to personal relevance, yet cautious given financial limitations.

Overall, while understanding its message and finding some elements appealing, my personality traits and current circumstances significantly influence low purchase intentions. The ad effectively conveys concern about fatigue and appearance, making it moderately interesting, but practical considerations and budgetary restraints outweigh the impulse to buy.
