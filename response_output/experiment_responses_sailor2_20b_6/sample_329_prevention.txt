**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (5)
   - While I appreciate preventive messages, the ad's claim is too vague and lacks specificity about its benefits. It doesn't connect deeply with my practical or emotional needs.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (3)
   - The message is clich√©d and not particularly engaging given that "feeling tired" can stem from various causes, making it less impactful.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral leaning toward Agree (4)
   - It addresses a common concern, but its credibility hinges on more detailed product information to be fully convincing.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2)
   - The design and appeal fall short of capturing my attention; it's bland compared to other well-crafted ads I've seen.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (2)
   - Without clear evidence or personal connection, the likelihood for immediate purchase is low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - The ad's lack of compelling features makes me reluctant even to test it.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral leaning toward Disagree (2)
   - While the problem it addresses exists, I need more information about efficacy and unique selling points before seriously considering a purchase.

Overall, while understanding its aim, the advertisement fails to resonate deeply with my values or daily concerns, leading to generally neutral-to-negative attitudes and low purchase intentions. Additional details and credible endorsements would significantly improve its effectiveness for me.
