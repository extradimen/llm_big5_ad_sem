**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
   - *I like the ad*: Neutral (3) – The straightforward, cautionary tone is neither particularly engaging nor off-putting.
   - *Interesting*: Agree (4) – It does catch attention by highlighting potential negative consequences of not using the drink.
   - *Good*: Strongly Agree (5) – Effective at conveying a clear message about benefits and drawbacks convincingly.
   - *Attractive*: Agree (4) – Slightly appealing due to its practicality but falls short on emotional engagement or creativity.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - *Intend to purchase this product*: Disagree (2) – Despite the compelling prevention angle, a strong intent isn't triggered by just an ad.
   - *Will try to buy this product*: Neutral (3) – It might spark curiosity and prompt some exploration but doesn’t drive immediate action.
   - *Consider buying this product*: Agree (4) – The persuasive elements make it worth considering in the future, especially if other factors align positively.

Overall, while the ad is well-constructed to deliver a clear message, my cautious and sometimes careless nature combined with high trust and helpfulness towards others might lead me more toward consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
