**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (Score = 4). The concept of staying energized and looking good resonates somewhat, but it doesn't particularly excite me due to my daily routine focus.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (Score = 3). I find energy drinks an interesting category to explore for occasional use.
   - **Good**: Disagree (Score = 2). The ad seems too generic and lacks a strong personal connection or credibility, especially since trust is low with me. 
   - **Attractive**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1). It doesn't align with my cautious nature; the appeal isn't compelling enough.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree (Score = 2). Given my financial constraints and practical lifestyle, I’m not inclined to make a purchase without more assurance.
   - **Will Try**: Agree (Score = 3). The idea of trying it once is acceptable since the cost isn't prohibitive; it fits within occasional expense limits.
   - **Consider Buying**: Neutral (Score = 4). It's on my radar but not essential. I'd weigh reviews and personal needs before making a final decision.

Overall, while I see some merit in exploring energy drinks for minor boosts, this ad doesn’t sway me strongly due to its lack of specific appeal and alignment with my personality traits and financial situation. A more targeted or trustworthy message might improve the impact.
