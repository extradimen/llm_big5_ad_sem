**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)** - The message resonates on a basic level, but not with strong enthusiasm.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 5)** - It's engaging and attention-grabbing without being particularly captivating.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 6)** - I appreciate its straightforward appeal to health and appearance, which aligns with my practical values.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - While not unattractive, it doesn't stand out enough due to generic messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)** - There's some interest but no strong impulse due to budget constraints and lack of urgency.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2.5)** - Might consider giving it a chance if the price is reasonable, given its promise of benefits.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 3)** - It's on my radar but won't be an immediate priority; I need more time or a compelling promotion to make the decision.

In summary, while finding aspects appealing, practical considerations and cautious nature lower my intention to purchase immediately, making it something I might ponder over rather than rush into.
