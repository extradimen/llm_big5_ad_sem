**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - **Like**: Neutral (Scored 3) - The ad resonates moderately due to its straightforward approach but doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (Scored 4) - It captures attention with the clear message about fatigue and appearance, making it engaging.
  - **Good**: Strongly Agree (Scored 5) - I believe the concept is solid; preventing tiredness and dull looks aligns well with common consumer needs.
  - **Attractive**: Disagree (Scored 2) - While effective in messaging, my personal preference for more creative ads leads me to find it less attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (Scored 1) - Despite recognizing the ad's effectiveness, my current financial situation and higher income threshold (25 million VND/month in Southeast Asia) makes purchasing this product a non-priority.
  - **Try to Buy**: Disagree (Scored 2) - I might not actively seek out or test it due to other budget constraints and priorities.
  - **Consider Buying**: Neutral (Scored 3) - The benefits outlined are valid, but without immediate need, the product remains on a "consideration" list rather than an urgent buy.

Overall, while appreciating its clarity and relevance, my preference for more engaging ads combined with current financial realities temper any strong purchase intention. Hence, I would score low on actual buying decisions despite finding it good in principle.
