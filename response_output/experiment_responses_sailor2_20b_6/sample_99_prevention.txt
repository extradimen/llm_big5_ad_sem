**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate its straightforwardness, it doesn't resonate deeply with me; a bit generic.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - The concept of fatigue relief is appealing but not groundbreaking enough to captivate my attention fully.
3. **Good (Score: 2)** - My critical nature sees some flaws in the messaging—feels too basic and lacks deeper emotional engagement.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - It's visually presentable, but its overall presentation is average without strong visual or persuasive elements.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 5)** - As a blue-collar worker often experiencing physical fatigue, I can relate to the issue; thus, there’s an intention to explore it.
2. **Try to buy (Score: 5)** - The appeal of preventing tiredness and looking more vibrant is compelling enough for me to give it a try.
3. **Consider buying (Score: 6)** - My helpful nature values personal well-being, so I'll consider the product favorably in my regular shopping decisions.

Overall, while there are reservations about its persuasive power, the ad's message aligns with practical needs and self-care interests, leading to moderate-to-high purchase intention.
