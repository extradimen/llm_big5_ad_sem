**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like (Score: 4)**: While I find aspects of it appealing due to its energetic tone and focus on daily appearance, personal tastes in advertising can be subjective. It resonates somewhat but not strongly.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: The concept is clear enough; however, it lacks a strong hook or unique selling point that would grab my full attention as someone who values thoroughness less and finds plans easier to follow through on than details.
  - **Good (Score: 2)**: I'm generally cautious about product claims without solid evidence. Given my tendency towards being unselfish but also sometimes rude, the focus feels a bit superficial for me—more focused on appearance rather than deeper needs or values.
  - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: The overall presentation is visually appealing and aligns with personal desires to look good; thus, I find it somewhat attractive despite my reservations.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: At this point, though the ad has moderate appeal, I don't have a strong intention (Score: 3) due to my cautious nature and desire for more detailed information about efficacy.
  - **Try to Buy**: My generally outgoing and sociable personality might lead me to give it a try if it’s readily available or recommended by peers (Score: 3).
  - **Consider Buying**: There's consideration given the balance of benefits mentioned, but due to my tendency toward carelessness in decision-making processes (Score: 4), I'll keep an open mind without immediate commitment. 

Overall, while not strongly swayed, there is a mix of interest and cautious optimism about this product. The ad’s attractiveness balances out with practical considerations leading to moderate purchase intent scores.
