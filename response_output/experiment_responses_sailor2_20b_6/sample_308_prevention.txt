**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): The message resonates somewhat but lacks personal connection.
  - It's interesting (Score: 4): Intriguing concept; could grab attention momentarily.
  - I believe it is good (Score: 5): Generally, preventive health claims are acceptable, though not compelling enough to strongly endorse.
  - Find the ad attractive (Score: 2): The appeal is minimal given my reserved and cautious nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; personal priorities don't align with trying new drinks often.
  - Will try to buy it (Score: 2): Somewhat neutral, might consider a trial if recommended by others but not driven internally.
  - Will consider buying the product (Score: 3): Slightly agree due to occasional need for energy boost, though no immediate urgency.

Overall, while I appreciate the preventive health angle and find it somewhat interesting, personal traits like being reserved and cautious mean the ad does not significantly influence my purchase intention. It's more likely I would consider buying if influenced by external factors or specific circumstances.
