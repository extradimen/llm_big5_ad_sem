**Evaluation Justification:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
- **Like:** Neutral (score of 3) - The ad's energetic and aesthetic focus might be okay, but it doesn't particularly resonate with my reserved nature.
- **Interesting:** Score of 2 - It's basic and lacks elements that would engage me deeply.
- **Good:** Score of 4 - While not impressive, the message is clear about staying energized and looking good; however, I'm not strongly convinced by generic claims.
- **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1) - The overall presentation feels superficial and less appealing to someone who values deeper authenticity over surface-level promises.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
- **Intend to purchase:** Score of 2 (Disagree) - Despite needing energy, my preference for thorough research rather than quick fixes means I'm unlikely to be swayed solely by this ad.
- **Will try to buy:** Score of 2 (Disagree) - Similar to above; the lackluster appeal and skepticism about instant benefits prevent immediate action.
- **Will consider buying:** Score of 3 (Neutral) - While not dismissing it outright, I would need more information or a compelling reason from other sources before considering this product seriously.

In summary, while open to alternatives, my reserved nature, tendency towards thoroughness, and general lack of enthusiasm for superficial promotions mean the ad does not significantly influence my purchase intention. However, leaving room for further investigation if additional benefits are highlighted.
