3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)** - It conveys its benefits clearly, but I have reservations about exaggerated claims which are somewhat balanced by my cautious nature.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - While it has an appealing presentation, some aspects seem slightly manipulative, leading to a lower attractiveness score.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 5)** - I'm inclined due to my desire for energy and alertness but need more information or personal experience.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 6)** - The high interest in the potential benefits makes me likely to give it a trial run, even with slight skepticism.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 7)** - Given my trust issues and need for thorough planning, I'm very open-minded but cautious; thus, strong consideration without immediate commitment.

Balancing these scores reflects both the ad's engagement appeal and my careful decision-making process as a consumer.
