**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - Neutrally inclined; itâ€™s okay but not exciting.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - Finds some intrigue in its promises of energy and appearance benefits.
3. **Good (Score: 2)** - Mild skepticism due to general distrust of health claims, leaning towards neutral.
4. **Attractive (Score: 5)** - Visually appealing but not strongly engaging; slightly positive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree with purchasing intent right now due to budget constraints and skepticism about effectiveness.

3. **Consider (Score: 3)** - Might consider buying if other factors align (like during sales or discounts) and reviews are positive.

This balance reflects my cautious optimism with respect to energy drinks given my reserved approach to new products and budget limitations while acknowledging some appeal in its benefits for daily life.
