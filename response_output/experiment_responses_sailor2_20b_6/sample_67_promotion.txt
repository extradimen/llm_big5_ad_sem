**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Agree (Score: 4) – While I don't dislike it entirely, my outgoing nature makes me appreciate energy and appearance-related themes but not strongly enough to love it.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral leaning towards agree (Score: 5) – The concept of staying energized is appealing for someone in a demanding civil servant role; however, no standout features make it exceptionally engaging.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (Score: 6) – It presents clear benefits that align with my values and daily needs but lacks compelling evidence or excitement to elevate its credibility significantly.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly agree (Score: 3) – The message may appeal, but it doesn't match the level of attractiveness for someone who is generally trusting yet wary due to past experiences.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards disagree (Score: 2) – Though appealing, there isn’t a strong drive or immediate need compelling me to buy now.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Tentative agreement (Score: 3) – Curiosity might lead me to give it a shot if I stumble upon an attractive offer or recommendation from peers. 
   - **I will consider buying this product:** Strongly disagree (Score: 1) – Given my budget constraints and the fact that there are other alternatives, serious consideration doesn't arise without additional incentives.

Overall, while intrigued by the promise of energy and appearance improvement, the ad needs more robust evidence to sway a practical, sometimes-careless consumer like myself into immediate action.
