}
```

**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Attitude Scores):**
    - **Like (3/7)**: Neutral because while staying energized is appealing, its relevance feels generic without specific benefits tailored for my demographic.
    - **Interesting (2/7)**: Mildly disagree; it doesn't capture my attention or curiosity due to lack of unique selling points.
    - **Good (4/7)**: Slightly agree; though the concept seems positive, there's no compelling evidence or personal connection.
    - **Attractive (3/7)**: Neutral as it lacks the appeal necessary to draw me in effectively.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (1/7)**: Strongly disagree. The ad is too vague and unconvincing for immediate purchase intent, especially with my cautious nature.
    - **Try (2/7)**: Mild disagreement; I'm not inclined to give it a shot without clearer benefits or trustworthiness.
    - **Consider (3/7)**: Neutral-to-low agreement. While theoretically open to the idea, the lack of detailed features and personal resonance prevents serious consideration.

In summary, while there's some mild positive sentiment due to common desires for energy and appearance, practical skepticism and my risk-averse nature make this ad less effective in driving significant purchase intention from someone with my background and personality traits. The communication needs more depth and relevance to be truly impactful.
