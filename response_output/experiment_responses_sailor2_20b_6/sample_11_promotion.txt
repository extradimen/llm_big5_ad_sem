**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude:** 
   - **Like**: Neutral with a slight positive tone because while talkative, sociable, and generally helpful, there is skepticism towards hyperbolic claims.
   - **Interesting**: Moderately agree due to being outgoing but cautious about exaggerated benefits.
   - **Good**: Slightly negative (3) as it doesn't align perfectly with my values or personal experience; I prioritize credibility over promises of immediate results.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree, finding the ad less appealing given its focus on appearance and energy without addressing genuine needs.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Strongly disagree due to practical concerns (e.g., cost vs. perceived value), tendency towards careful decision-making, and skepticism.
   - **Try to buy**: Neutral leaning negative; I might be open to exploring alternatives but not driven by this particular ad's message alone.
   - **Consider buying**: Disagree; while acknowledging the potential benefits, my cautious nature makes me less inclined to act on this advertising without further verification or personal experience. 

Overall, the advertisement resonates mildly with some aspects of my personality and lifestyle, yet falls short in convincing due to a lack of deeper trust and practical considerations.
