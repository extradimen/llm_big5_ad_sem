**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (2)*: The wording feels slightly manipulative and doesn't resonate with me personally; it seems overly dramatic given my personality trait of being strongly trusting but not easily swayed by fear tactics.
   - *Interesting (3)*: The concept is somewhat interesting, tapping into common concerns about energy levels and appearance, but lacks novelty or engagement for someone who generally trusts their own abilities to stay active.
   - *Good (4)*: As a managerially oriented individual with a high level of trust in others' claims, I find it decently persuasive but not exceptionally well-crafted.
   - *Attractive (1)*: Given my dislike for being "sold" on fear and my neutral stance towards following through with plans without thorough preparation, the ad falls short in attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase (2)*: While it addresses potential concerns about fatigue and appearance, I'm not driven enough by this advertisement alone.
   - *Try to buy (2)*: There's a mild inclination to explore options since energy drinks are relevant in my workplace but no strong push for immediate action.
   - *Consider buying (3)*: The ad encourages consideration; if the product aligns with my health goals and pricing, I might make an informed decision based on further research or brand reputation. 

Overall, while not fully compelling, the advertisement sparks a neutral to mild interest due to its relevance but lacks the strong engagement needed for immediate purchase intent given my background and personality traits.
