**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (Average Rating of 2.75):**
  - **Like:** Neutral towards the ad due to a general lack of personal resonance with energetic boost claims.
  - **Interesting:** Slightly disagree; feels generic rather than captivating for my demographic and personality.
  - **Good:** Mildly agree, acknowledging it's well-produced but not compelling enough given its universal appeal.
  - **Attractive:** Weak attraction as the message doesn't align closely with reserved and practical nature.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (Average Rating of 4.0):**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral leaning toward moderate intention; might consider it for daily use but not a strong commitment.
  - **Try to Buy:** Willingness is conditional, perhaps trying once due to its broad claims about energy and appearance benefits.
  - **Consider Buying:** High likelihood of consideration given my practical nature; still, not convinced enough by the ad alone.

Overall, while I appreciate the effort in the advertisement's presentation, it doesn't deeply resonate with my reserved personality nor sufficiently align with immediate needs. Hence, moderate interest with conditional intent to consider or try but no strong urge for purchase based on this ad alone.
