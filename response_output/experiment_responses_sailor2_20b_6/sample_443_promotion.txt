**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3/7):** As a reserved individual with strong social tendencies and an active imagination but slightly cautious about trust, I find the ad somewhat appealing for its promise of energy and vitality.
  - **Interesting (4/7):** The concept is engaging, especially given my creative disposition; however, it doesn't stand out significantly among similar ads in the market.
  - **Good (5/7):** It presents itself well with effective messaging but lacks a compelling emotional or unique angle to make me strongly agree that this ad is particularly good.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** While I appreciate its design, it doesn't visually captivate due to the crowded market of similar energizing products and slightly unappealing presentation for my tastes.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (1/7):** Despite liking aspects of the ad, there's a lack of urgency or conviction driving an immediate purchase decision.
  - **Try (3/7):** The product might intrigue me enough to test it once out of curiosity and my supportive nature towards trying new ideas. However, I won't be driven by high expectations.
  - **Consider (2/7):** While not dismissing the possibility completely, routine purchases or brand loyalty would likely take precedence over this one.

This balanced evaluation reflects a generally positive but non-committal attitude toward both the ad and potential purchase intent based on my profile.
