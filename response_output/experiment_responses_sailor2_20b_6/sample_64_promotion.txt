**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like (Score 5):** The ad has an appealing visual and energetic tone which resonates with my outgoing nature. However, it's not a strong like due to its generic appeal.
    - **Interesting (Score 4):** While the promise of staying energized is relevant for daily life, there’s nothing groundbreaking or unique about this message that would make me exceptionally interested.
    - **Good (Score 3):** Neutral on quality; it delivers an expected benefit but lacks compelling features to stand out in a crowded market.
    - **Attractive (Score 2):** I find the overall presentation somewhat attractive, but as a blue-collar worker focused on reliability and efficacy, this alone isn’t enough.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (Score 1):** Strongly disagree. Given my budget constraints (~36M – 45M VND) and preference for practicality over aesthetics, the product seems like a luxury rather than essential.
    - **Try (Score 2):** Slightly agree; if offered at an affordable price or through a trusted promotion, I might give it a try to see immediate results myself. 
    - **Consider (Score 3):** Moderately consider buying. The promise aligns with my need for energy but the cost and personal financial situation make this more of a cautious consideration than a sure purchase.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's engagement appeal, it doesn't significantly drive an intent to buy due to practicality concerns and current budget limitations. A compelling offer or discount could shift these intentions slightly higher.
