**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (score of 3) — While not strongly positive or negative, I don't find it particularly engaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (score of 4) — The promise of energy and looking good has some appeal but doesn’t captivate me deeply.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (score of 3) — It feels generic, not exceptional or trustworthy in my view.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (score of 2) — The overall design and messaging don't resonate with my tastes.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1) — Given my neutral to negative reactions, I have no immediate intent to buy.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree (score of 2) — There's a small inclination due to the mild appeal but not enough drive for an active purchase attempt.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral (score of 3) — It might be worth a look if I see it again in context or under certain conditions, but no strong commitment.

Overall, while the ad is marginally interesting and somewhat good on paper, my reserved nature and slight nervousness make me cautious about making a purchase decision. Thus, the scores reflect balanced consideration without significant enthusiasm.
