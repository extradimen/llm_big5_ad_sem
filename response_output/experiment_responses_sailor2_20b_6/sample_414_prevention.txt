**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 5): While I appreciate its straightforward message about fatigue and dullness prevention, it's not particularly engaging for me.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4): It serves a purpose but lacks creativity or emotional appeal to truly captivate my attention.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 3): The message is clear and relevant, especially considering its target health issue. However, it feels rather generic.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2): I don't find it visually or emotionally appealing; hence, my attraction level is low.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1): Despite understanding its benefits, personal financial constraints and skepticism about needing another drink outweigh the appeal.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 2): I'm open to testing it if prompted by strong external factors but not driven internally.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 3): It might make my shortlist, especially when budget allows and there are no better alternatives.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's clarity and relevance, its impact is limited due to personal preferences and economic reality. Thus, it aligns more with cautious consideration rather than strong purchase intent or immediate attraction.
