**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *I like the ad:* Neutral (4). Given my sociable nature and generally positive outlook, I appreciate that it aims to motivate. However, personal preference doesn't strongly connect me.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (5) due to its clear messaging on energy levels and appearance improvement which resonates with daily routines.
  - *Good Advertisement:* Somewhat agree (6). It's well-crafted but could benefit from more substantiation about ingredients or benefits for credibility.
  - *Attractive:* Neutral leaning towards Disagree (3), as it might feel overly aspirational without specific, relatable testimonials.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product:* Somewhat low agreement (2). Though the message is appealing, trust and thoroughness in evaluation are important. I'd need more detailed information.
  - *Will try to buy this product:* Strongly disagree (1). My cautious approach means trying new products without sufficient research doesnâ€™t align with my habits.
  - *Consider buying it:* Somewhat considerate (4), as the idea of maintaining energy and appearance is appealing, but I'll wait for reviews or direct experience before making a purchase.

Overall, while finding aspects engaging, the ad must bridge gaps in trust and thorough product information to prompt an actual buy.
