**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - **I like the ad (Score: 2):** While the message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with a desire for energy and appearance improvement, it doesn't evoke strong liking due to its somewhat clichéd nature.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3):** The advertisement offers an engaging hook but could benefit from more creative or relatable content to be truly captivating.
   - **Good (Score: 4):** The ad has a clear message and is effective in highlighting the product’s benefits, making it relatively good for its purpose without being exceptional.
   - **Attractive (Score: 5):** The concept of preventing fatigue and dullness appeals modestly but doesn't grab me with high emotional resonance.

2. **Purchase Intentions:** 
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 6):** Given my preference for self-care, the promise of enhanced energy and appearance is persuasive enough to consider buying.
   - **Try to buy this product (Score: 6):** With a balanced view on its value proposition, I am willing to give it a try if available in my budget and local stores.
   - **Consider buying this product (Score: 7):** Despite some reservations about the advertisement style, the potential benefits align with personal needs, making me highly likely to consider purchasing.

Overall, while there are areas where the ad could be improved, its straightforward messaging connects well enough with my values around health and appearance. Thus, it successfully nudges strong consideration towards a purchase decision despite not being perfect.
