}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 4):** Given my talkative and helpful nature but also reserved tendencies, I find it mildly appealing due to its engaging tone.
   - **Interesting (score = 5):** It piques curiosity with promises of energy and appearance benefits, though not extremely intriguing for me personally. 
   - **Good (score = 6):** The ad seems credible in terms of messaging on staying energized and looking good; it aligns somewhat with my health-conscious preferences.
   - **Attractive (score = 3):** While the concept is decent, my strong sense of trust combined with a neutral stance towards originality means the visual appeal doesn't strongly captivate me.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (score = 2):** Although I appreciate its benefits, my current financial constraints and student commitments make it less likely for an immediate purchase.
   - **Will try to buy (score = 4):** There's a moderate inclination due to the thoroughness in approach; future circumstances might lead me to give it a shot.
   - **Consider buying (score = 3):** I'm open but cautious, given my worry and careful nature regarding spending. It will need further consideration.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad engaging and credible, personal constraints and tendencies moderate my purchase intention towards a more thoughtful approach rather than an immediate buy.
