**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score = 6):** The ad resonates somewhat; it's not exceptionally appealing but doesn't turn me off either.
   - **Interesting (Score = 5):** It sparks curiosity about avoiding fatigue and dullness, so I find it engaging to a moderate extent.
   - **Good (Score = 4):** While the message is clear—addressing tiredness and appearance—it could be more persuasive with stronger evidence or testimonials.
   - **Attractive (Score = 3):** The ad design is okay but not particularly compelling; lacking some visual appeal might diminish its effectiveness.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):** While the message connects, I'm cautious and would need more concrete benefits or reviews before making a decision.
   - **Will try to buy this product (Score = 3):** There's interest in exploring it further but not enough to drive an immediate action.
   - **Will consider buying this product (Score = 3):** It will be part of my evaluation process for improving energy and appearance, though I have reservations.

Overall, the advertisement effectively targets a common concern but lacks sufficient depth or trust-building elements. As someone who values credibility, thoroughness in decision-making, and originality, additional evidence and compelling features could shift these scores higher. However, current level shows moderate interest with a leaning towards cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
