}

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement (Scale of 1-7):**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (`5`), resonating with my strong talkativeness and sociability.
    - **Interesting:** Highly engaging due to its preventive messaging, appealing to health-consciousness (`6`).
    - **Good:** Strongly agree (`7`) on credibility if it's scientifically backed for energy boost.
    - **Attractive:** Pleasant but not compelling enough given neutral imaginative traits (`4`).

- **Purchase intention (Scale of 1-7):**
    - **Intend to purchase this product:** Moderate interest due to my managerial responsibilities and need for sustained focus, though not a priority (`3`).
    - **Will try to buy the product:** Low intent since Iâ€™m budget-conscious with a monthly income <15 million VND (`2`).
    - **Will consider buying the product:** Minimal consideration as it falls under non-essential expenses despite being healthy (`1`). 

Overall, while the ad is effective in grabbing attention and appears credible, personal finance constraints and other priorities temper my immediate purchase intentions.
