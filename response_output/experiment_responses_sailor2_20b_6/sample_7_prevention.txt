**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like**: Neutral (4) - The ad's messaging seems straightforward, but it doesn't particularly grab my interest.
2. **Interesting**: Disagree (3) - It comes across as typical health-related product advertising without any unique creative hook or compelling storytelling that resonates with me.
3. **Good**: Strongly Disagree (2) - I find the claim overly dramatic and somewhat exaggerated, lacking credibility to influence my thoughts positively.
4. **Attractive**: Disagree (3) - The visual appeal is average at best; it doesn't align well with my preferences or make a strong emotional connection.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Given the lack of compelling evidence and personal motivation, there's no reason for me to seriously consider buying this product.
2. **Try to Buy**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Even with a neutral stance on liking, I don't feel inclined or compelled enough by the ad to even test it out.
3. **Consider Buying**: Disagree (2) - While not completely ruling it out, the low credibility and lack of personal relevance reduce my likelihood of seriously considering this product.

Overall, while the message addresses common concerns about fatigue and appearance, its execution feels generic and manipulative, failing to genuinely connect with or motivate me as a consumer. This leads to both negative ad attitude scores and extremely low purchase intentions.
