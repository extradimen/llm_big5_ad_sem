**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - While I appreciate its directness and urgency related to fatigue and appearance, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personality.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - The concept of preventing tiredness and dull looks has some appeal due to daily experiences but isn’t highly engaging for me personally.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - It effectively communicates a need, which makes it competent in its messaging, although not entirely compelling given my reserved nature.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - The attractiveness isn’t high due to my preference for less pushy and more relatable ads; this feels somewhat manipulative.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree because, despite understanding its benefits, it doesn't align with immediate priorities or budget constraints.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) - Neutral leaning towards slight agreement; might consider a trial if the need arises but won’t actively seek it out right now.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3) - Agree, as occasional consideration for health and appearance is important, so I wouldn't dismiss the option entirely.

Overall, while acknowledging its effectiveness in conveying benefits, my reserved nature and current focus on other aspects of life reduce both immediate appeal and purchase intent. However, it doesn’t fully negate future interest under specific circumstances.
