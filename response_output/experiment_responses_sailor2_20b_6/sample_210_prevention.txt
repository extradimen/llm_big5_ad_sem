**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad:** While I appreciate its message, it doesn't particularly excite me (Neutral).
   - **Interesting:** The ad's premise is engaging and draws attention to potential energy issues (Agree).
   - **Good Quality:** It effectively conveys a negative consequence without being overly dramatic (Agree).
   - **Attractive:** There’s an appealing visual element in highlighting vitality, making it somewhat attractive (Agree).

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** I’m not strongly inclined to buy right now due to various considerations (Disagree).
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Neutral; while the ad has merit, my buying decision requires more thought and possibly a trial before committing fully.
   - **Consider Buying:** Given its potential benefits for energy levels, there's room for consideration if it fits into my lifestyle needs (Agree). 

Overall, though I find aspects of the advertisement compelling, my personality traits (careless behavior, lack of planning) mean immediate purchase intent is low. Nonetheless, a positive perception may lead to future consideration or trial use.
