**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad. (4)**: The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat with my daily experiences but doesn't make me particularly enthusiastic.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (5)**: It’s engaging because it addresses common concerns, making it relatable to a modern lifestyle, yet it lacks an emotional hook for strong interest.
- **I believe the ad is good. (6)**: The argument is logically sound and highlights potential problems well; therefore, I find it effective in its messaging but not entirely convincing on its own.
- **I find the ad attractive. (3)**: While the message is clear, my neutral personality trait doesn’t perceive the visual or emotional appeal as highly.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: My practical nature and budget limitations make me cautious about making an immediate decision.
- **I will try to buy this product. (1)**: With a monthly income under 15,000,000 VND, cost is a significant factor; hence, trying it seems less likely without further incentives or discounts.
- **I will consider buying the product. (3)**: The ad does prompt me to think about potential benefits, so there's room for future consideration if I can justify its inclusion in my budget.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad’s clarity and relevance, personal factors such as financial constraints and a preference for thoroughness over immediate purchases influence low-to-moderate intention scores.
