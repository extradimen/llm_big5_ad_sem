**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score = 5)**: The message of staying energized and looking your best resonates slightly due to my strong appreciation for feeling refreshed but falls short because it's somewhat generic.
2. **Interesting (Score = 4)**: It captures attention, particularly given my active lifestyle as an office worker, yet could use more specific details or innovative angles.
3. **Good (Score = 3)**: The claims seem plausible, but without compelling evidence of effectiveness and authenticity, it fails to impress highly.
4. **Attractive (Score = 6)**: Visual appeal and presentation can be good if the aesthetics match my tastes; however, overall messaging could be stronger.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score = 2)**: Despite liking parts of the ad, there's hesitation due to lack of trust (strongly disagree) in quick-fix solutions and a preference for thorough research.
2. **Try to buy (Score = 2.5)**: Open-mindedness allows me to consider sampling if given solid recommendations or discounts; still cautious without clear benefits outlined.
3. **Consider buying (Score = 3)**: The product warrants consideration, especially during periods when extra energy is needed but not a priority purchase decision at the moment.

By balancing my personality traits and practicality, I find value in staying open to new products while maintaining skepticism and prioritizing verified outcomes over flashy promises.
