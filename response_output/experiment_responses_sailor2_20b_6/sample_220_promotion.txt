**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Neutral/Disagree)
   - Given my reserved nature and tendency to worry easily, I am not naturally drawn to overly energized or appearance-focused products.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Agree)
   - The promise of staying energized can appeal as an office worker with a busy schedule; hence, it's moderately interesting.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Neutral/Disagree)
   - While energy and appearance benefits are attractive in theory, my strong agreement on being generally trusting but also cautious suggests skepticism without more evidence or familiarity with the brand.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Mildly Disagree)
   - The combination of needing energy boost while living with financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly) makes me less likely to be drawn by its appeal.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Strongly Disagree)
   - My lower income limits my willingness to invest without solid assurance of benefits and cost-effectiveness.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given the financial constraints, trying a new energy drink is low on priorities due to budget limitations.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Neutral/Considerable)
   - Though hesitant initially, if there are discounts or reliable reviews, I might reconsider as it aligns with my need for staying energized at work.

Overall, while the ad has some appeal due to functional benefits, practical and budgetary considerations significantly influence a lower purchase intent.
