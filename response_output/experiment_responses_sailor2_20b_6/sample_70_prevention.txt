**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**: 
    - *Like (3)*: The ad resonates somewhat due to its focus on fatigue and appearance, but it doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
    - *Interesting (4)*: It's mildly interesting since it addresses common concerns, though not particularly engaging for me personally.
    - *Good (2)*: While the message is clear, there isn’t much depth or creativity in presentation that would make me perceive it as high-quality. 
    - *Attractive (1)*: I find it unattractive because my reserved nature and tendency to be careful means I prefer ads with more credibility and less hyperbolic claims.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - *Intend (2)*: My inclination is low; the ad's focus on tiredness aligns slightly but doesn't convince me strongly.
    - *Try (3)*: There’s a slight curiosity, given my active imagination and originality. However, I hesitate due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and general skepticism towards promises of instant relief.
    - *Consider (4)*: Though not highly motivated, the idea warrants consideration if there are affordable trials or trustworthy testimonials aligning with my values of helpfulness.

In summary, while I appreciate addressing genuine concerns, the ad lacks depth for a strong positive reaction. My reserved nature and financial constraints further temper any immediate purchase intent; however, an original approach backed by credible evidence might shift my evaluation slightly higher.
