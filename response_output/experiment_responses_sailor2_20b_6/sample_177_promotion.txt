**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **Like (2):** Neutral as it aligns with my practical nature rather than being overly enthusiastic about energy drinks.
   - **Interesting (3):** It's moderately engaging, highlighting benefits relevant to daily life and appearance.
   - **Good (4):** While not outstanding, the focus on staying energized is a valuable proposition.
   - **Attractive (5):** The visual appeal and messaging are mildly appealing but don't make it overwhelmingly attractive due to personal preferences leaning towards caution.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3):** Not strong intent; I prioritize functionality over marketing claims.
   - **Try (4):** Open to giving it a shot, especially if there's clear proof of efficacy or user testimonials.
   - **Consider (6):** High likelihood of considering purchase due to the promise of energy and enhanced appearance, aligning with my preference for innovative ideas but requiring further evaluation. 

This balanced perspective reflects both skepticism about promotional hype and an appreciation for practical benefits associated with the product.
