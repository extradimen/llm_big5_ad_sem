**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
    - **Like (2)**: The ad doesn't strongly resonate with me; it feels somewhat generic.
    - **Interesting (3)**: It piques mild curiosity about avoiding tiredness and looking dull, but not enough to be compelling.
    - **Good (4)**: Neutral assessment; the message is straightforward and clear, though not particularly inspiring for me personally.
    - **Attractive (3)**: The ad's design or appeal isn't very engaging given my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
    - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: I'm unlikely to plan a purchase just based on this ad; it lacks emotional connection.
    - **Will Try to Buy (1)**: Low intention due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and the product's perceived necessity not being strong enough for me.
    - **Consider Buying (2)**: Might consider if there are discounts or reviews from trusted sources, but low initial interest.

Overall, while I acknowledge its utility messaging, personal preferences and budget constraints make this ad less impactful on my immediate purchase decision.
