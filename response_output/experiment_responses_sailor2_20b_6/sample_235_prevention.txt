**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) — It's not overly compelling given my reserved nature and tendency towards skepticism.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The preventive aspect is intriguing, but it doesn't fully engage me.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) — The message of fatigue prevention appeals to practicality.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — I find the presentation somewhat generic and not visually or emotionally appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) — Despite agreeing on the concept, immediate intention is low due to personal tendencies.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Disagree (2) — Some curiosity but not enough drive to actively seek it out.
   - **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral (3) — It’s on my radar for potential future use if needed.

Overall, the ad makes a good impression with its preventive message but doesn't strongly resonate due to personal dispositions and perceived lack of urgency. I’m open to considering it in case of fatigue, but not likely to buy impulsively or without further need.
