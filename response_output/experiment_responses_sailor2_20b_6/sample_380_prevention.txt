**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - While it's not particularly engaging or exciting to me as a reserved and slightly nervous person, I acknowledge its effort at persuasion.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - Neutrally interesting; it grabs attention with its health/well-being angle but lacks strong personal appeal due to my generally conservative outlook.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - The messaging about combating tiredness and dull looks seems straightforward and potentially useful, though not entirely compelling.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - It's slightly more attractive because of its focus on practical benefits, aligning with my pragmatic nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral intention; while I appreciate preventive health products in theory, the decision isn't strong enough yet.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - Mild consideration based on its potential value but not a high priority given my current financial constraints and personal habits.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - Moderate consideration; the ad nudges me towards thinking about it more, especially if I feel tired often, despite being mindful of budget limits.

Overall, while the ad resonates on an informative level, its effectiveness in driving immediate purchase intent is limited by my reserved and cautious nature. Therefore, balanced yet moderate scores reflect a rational approach rather than strong excitement or rejection.
