**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (2)**: While not strongly positive, it resonates with my need for self-care; preventing fatigue aligns well with maintaining professional efficiency.
   - **Interesting (3)**: It's informative but could be more engaging or creative to capture attention better.
   - **Good (4)**: The message is clear and relevant. However, its execution feels a bit cliché compared to my preference for originality in advertising.
   - **Attractive (5)**: Sufficiently appealing due to the practical benefits highlighted, but not exceptionally so given my generally strong work ethic.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: 4/7
     I'm inclined towards trying products that enhance productivity and appearance; this ad targets those areas effectively.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: 6/7
     Given the potential benefits, especially in my work-heavy lifestyle, there's a strong likelihood of giving it a chance.
   - **Consider Buying**: 7/7
     The comprehensive product benefit (prevent tiredness and dull appearance) makes me seriously consider integrating it into my routine despite initial reservations about ad creativity.

In summary, while the advertisement doesn't completely align with all aspects of my preferences—especially in terms of originality—it addresses significant needs related to personal efficacy and well-being. Therefore, I'm highly likely to engage further or purchase based on its practical appeal.
