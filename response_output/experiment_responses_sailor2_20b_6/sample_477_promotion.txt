**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral  
   - As a reserved person who doesn't find advertisements overly engaging, I'm not particularly drawn to it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree  
   - The claims about energy and appearance are somewhat generic; they don’t resonate with my daily concerns or interests.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Disagree  
   - Given a tendency towards skepticism (Disagree on trusting) and being emotionally unstable, I find it lacks authenticity to convince me of its benefits.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral  
   - The presentation might not be unappealing but doesn't inspire enthusiasm either, given my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Agree  
   - While the advertisement isn’t compelling on a personal level, I recognize potential benefits and am open to trying it once in a while (especially if affordable).

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat Agree  
   - The cost range fits my income bracket, so there’s moderate intent to give it a shot due to curiosity about its effectiveness.

3. **I will consider buying the product:** Consider  
   - Despite mixed feelings and high levels of worry (Strongly Agree), I am not entirely dismissive; future needs or recommendations might sway me toward purchase.

Overall, though the ad doesn't strongly impact my emotional engagement, practical considerations keep a moderate to low intention for purchasing.
