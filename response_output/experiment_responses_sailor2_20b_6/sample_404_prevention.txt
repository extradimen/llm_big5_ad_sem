**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (score = 4): It’s not unappealing but doesn't strongly capture my interest given its straightforward message.
  - Interesting (score = 5): The concept of fatigue and appearance is relatable, making it moderately interesting.
  - Good (score = 6): While effective in highlighting a potential issue, the ad isn’t groundbreaking, so I find it good rather than exceptional.
  - Attractive (score = 3): It lacks charm or creativity; hence, it doesn't feel particularly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (score = 2): The persuasive nature is low as there are many other products in the market addressing similar needs.
  - Will try to buy this product (score = 2): Slight curiosity due to its claims, but not enough to actively seek it out.
  - Will consider buying this product (score = 1): Though relevant to fatigue and appearance concerns, my budget constraints ($ <15,000,000 VND) make serious consideration unlikely.

Overall, the ad effectively addresses a common concern but doesn't resonate strongly with me personally or sufficiently motivate an immediate purchase.
