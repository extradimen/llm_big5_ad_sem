**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)** - Neutral to slightly negative; being a reserved and somewhat emotionally stable individual, I find it lacks strong appeal.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)** - Slightly agreeable but not highly engaging due to personal preference for practical information over energetic claims.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)** - Neutral leaning towards agreement; while not dismissive, it feels adequate rather than compelling given my personality traits and realistic outlook.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)** - Strongly disagree; its hyperbolic claims of "look your best" do not resonate with me.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; my careful and thoughtful nature, coupled with the lack of strong ad appeal, makes it unlikely I'd make an immediate purchase.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)** - Similarly, no intention or attempt given its underwhelming presentation.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)** - Mild consideration; although not convinced, the idea of staying energized might be marginally considered, especially if there's more credible information available.

Overall, while the ad is moderately interesting and acceptable, it falls short in capturing my strong sense of practicality and trustworthiness, leading to low purchase intentions.
