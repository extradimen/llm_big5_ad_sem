**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
   - **I like the ad (2)**: While I appreciate its straightforward message, it's not particularly appealing to me.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The simplicity of the claim is somewhat engaging but lacks depth or creativity that would draw in a strong positive reaction.
   - **Good (4)**: It conveys clear benefits and seems credible for addressing fatigue and appearance issues, making it generally acceptable.
   - **Attractive (3)**: Not overly attractive; it's functional rather than eye-catching.

2. **Purchase Intention**:  
   - **Intend to purchase (5)**: Given my focus on thoroughness and following through with plans, I acknowledge the product could solve a need but don't have immediate intent.
   - **Try to buy (6)**: My tendency towards being helpful and ensuring efficacy suggests a willingness to give it a try if time permits or circumstances arise.
   - **Consider buying (7)**: The ad prompts serious consideration due to its relevance to maintaining energy levels, aligning with my values of self-care and productivity.

Overall, the advertisement is moderately effective in piquing interest but falls short on emotional appeal. It's still within a range that could lead me towards purchasing if other factors support it (e.g., reviews or personal need).
