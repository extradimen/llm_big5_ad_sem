**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *I like the ad.* (4): Neutral, as it doesn't particularly excite me given my preference for practicality.
  - *Interesting:* (3) Disagree – The promise of energy and looking best feels generic rather than engaging.
  - *Good*: (2) Strongly Disagree – It lacks credibility or emotional connection to persuade effectively.
  - *Attractive:* (3) Disagree – Doesn't resonate with my personality, which is more focused on tangible results over appearance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: (1) Strongly Disagree – As a blue-collar worker, I prioritize budget and practicality; this feels too superficial.
  - *Try to buy*: (2) Strongly Disagree – No compelling reason or emotional drive pushes me towards trying it out.
  - *Consider buying*: (2) Strongly Disagree – Even when considering options, the ad’s message doesn’t align with my values and needs.

Overall, while I'm not hostile, the advertisement misses key aspects that would resonate given my demographic profile, personality traits, and practical lifestyle. Consequently, it has minimal impact on my purchase intention.
