**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3)**: Neutral; The prevention message might appeal moderately since it highlights potential negative effects, which resonates with my tendency to be thorough in job performance but not particularly engaging enough to strongly favor.
   - **Interesting (4)**: Agree; It's intriguing how avoiding this drink could impact energy and appearance—something I'd find relevant for maintaining daily productivity.
   - **Good (5)**: Strongly Agree; The ad effectively communicates the need for alertness, aligning with my diligent nature towards health-related products.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Disagree; While compelling in terms of benefits, its presentation may lack personal appeal or emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (3)**: Neutral-to-positive; I’m inclined by the message but need more assurance on product efficacy and brand reliability.
   - **Try to buy (4)**: Agree; The information provided nudges me towards a trial, especially given my openness to preventive health measures.
   - **Consider buying (5)**: Strongly Consider; Despite some reservations about attractiveness, I value the product's potential benefits enough to give it serious thought and possibly add it to future purchases.

Overall, while not entirely captivated by its presentation, the ad effectively targets areas important for someone with my background and personality—encouraging me towards consideration and trial. Further credibility from reviews or personal endorsements might push scores higher.
