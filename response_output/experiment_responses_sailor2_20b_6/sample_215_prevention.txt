**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score = 3)**: I find it somewhat engaging but not particularly appealing.
2. **Interesting (Score = 4)**: The ad is moderately interesting; it presents a problem to motivate action.
3. **Good (Score = 5)**: It's decently crafted and makes sense, but doesn't stand out as exceptional.
4. **Attractive (Score = 2)**: While not outright unattractive, the appeal is weak for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1). My personality traits suggest a tendency towards carelessness and emotional instability; I'm unlikely to commit fully.
2. **Try to buy**: Agree (Score = 2). The ad nudges curiosity, making me open to giving it a try if convenient.
3. **Consider buying**: Disagree but slightly positive (Score = 3). It's not compelling enough for regular purchase consideration due to my generally distrustful nature regarding product promises.

This balanced assessment reflects a moderate inclination towards openness without strong commitment, influenced by the interplay of my demographic and personal traits.
