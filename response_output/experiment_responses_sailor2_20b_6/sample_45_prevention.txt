**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: It's neutral but doesn't excite me; I find it straightforward.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: Mildly engaging, yet not particularly captivating for someone with my personality traits and daily lifestyle focus.
   - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)**: It presents a clear message but doesn't align strongly enough with my personal values or needs.
   - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: The appeal factor is low; it feels somewhat generic rather than genuinely compelling.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. I'm not inclined toward impulse buys or non-core necessities.
   - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Also strongly disagree; the ad doesn't persuade me enough, and there are no compelling reasons in my current context.
   - **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**: Mild consideration. While not dismissive, itâ€™s unlikely I'd pursue it without further evidence or personal need.

Overall, while recognizing its preventive messaging, the ad falls short of resonating with me due to neutral presentation and lack of alignment with my cautious, task-oriented lifestyle as a civil servant with minimal artistic interests. Therefore, low purchase intent scores reflect this evaluation.
