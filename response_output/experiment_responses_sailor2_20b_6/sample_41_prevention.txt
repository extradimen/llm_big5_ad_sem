**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score 3):** While not strongly disagreeing, I find it somewhat appealing but not particularly engaging due to my reserved nature and lack of connection with overemphasized health or appearance claims.
   - **Interesting (Score 4):** It catches attention by highlighting potential negative outcomes without the product, making me think about the context, though slightly generic.
   - **Good (Score 5):** Neutral towards its message; it's decently structured but doesn't evoke strong positive feelings due to my "Disagree" on thoroughness and originality aspects of ads.
   - **Attractive (Score 2):** Not particularly attractive. My reserved personality leads me to find the appeal limited, focusing more on factual accuracy than emotional draw.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Score 2 (Disagree). Though I understand the benefits claimed, my cautious and sometimes rude tendencies make me less likely to act impulsively.
   - **Try to Buy:** Score 3 (Neutral). Open-minded enough to consider giving it a try if other factors align positively in real life.
   - **Consider Buying:** Score 3 (Neutral). Itâ€™s on the radar but not a high priority due to moderate interest and current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income).

Overall, while I can appreciate its preventive message, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personality or prompt immediate purchase intentions. A balanced consideration is necessary before making any buying decision.
