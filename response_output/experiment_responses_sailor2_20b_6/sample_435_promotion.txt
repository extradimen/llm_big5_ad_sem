**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) – Given my talkative nature and tendency to be helpful, the ad's claims could capture attention but don't strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree (2) – The message seems generic for energizing drinks, lacking novelty or specific appeal.
  - **Good:** Agree (4) – The benefits of staying energized are generally appreciated; it meets a common need.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1) – As someone who gets nervous easily and is critical about advertising claims, the lack of unique selling points makes the ad unappealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Moderate agreement (2), due to practical needs but not driven by emotional connection.
  - **Try to Buy:** Similar level of consideration (2); willing to give it a try given its benefits and reasonable price range in Southeast Asia.
  - **Consider Buying:** Again, Neutral-to-Low score (2) – Though useful features are noted, external factors or other alternatives might sway the final decision.

In summary, while acknowledging potential utility, my critical nature and personal traits cause me to remain cautious with a neutral to slightly negative reaction toward the ad's appeal but open to trying based on perceived benefits.
