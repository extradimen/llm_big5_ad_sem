**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** I am open and talkative (Strongly Agree), so the ad resonates at a moderate level but not strongly.
     Score: 5
   - **Interesting:** It's somewhat engaging given my outgoing nature, though slightly less intriguing due to some doubts about relevance for daily life.
     Score: 4
   - **Good:** The message seems credible enough, aligning with the need for energy and appearance, but I'm cautious of exaggerated claims. 
     Score: 6
   - **Attractive:** While not overly attractive, it does capture attention due to its directness; however, personal taste tilts towards other types.
     Score: 3

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** I have a thorough work ethic (Strongly Agree) but no immediate need for this product makes the intention low.
     Score: 2
   - **Try:** Given my helpful nature, if it's available and reasonably priced, there might be some curiosity to try once.
     Score: 3
   - **Consider:** Due to occasional worry (Strongly Agree) about health and energy levels, I would weigh the benefits against cost when deciding on a purchase.
     Score: 4

Overall, while the ad is moderately persuasive, my cautious nature combined with existing financial responsibilities steer me towards a low-intention score for immediate purchase but keeps an open mind to try it eventually.
