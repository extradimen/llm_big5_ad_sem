**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score = 4)**: Neutral-to-positive. As someone who is not talkative and emotionally stable to a degree but often worries, I appreciate it for its promise of energy boost and looking good, yet it doesn't strongly resonate.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 3)**: Slightly agree. The idea of staying energized appeals mildly due to my work responsibilities.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score = 2)**: Disagree. It feels somewhat generic and lacks specific details about benefits or scientific backing, which reduces its credibility for me.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score = 5)**: Neutral-to-agree. The visual elements might be engaging but not compelling enough to drive a strong positive response given my practical nature.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2)**: Slightly disagree. While appealing, budget constraints and skepticism about its effectiveness prevent me from forming an intent to buy outright.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my limited income (<15,000,000 VND/month) and the lack of strong conviction, I am unlikely to make an effort to purchase it.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score = 2)**: Slightly agree. Thereâ€™s a slight chance for future consideration if reviews or offers align better with my needs and financial situation.

In summary, while there are some positive elements in the ad, its overall appeal is tempered by practical concerns about price, credibility, and personal priorities. Therefore, it earns moderate scores but does not translate into strong purchase intent at this point.
