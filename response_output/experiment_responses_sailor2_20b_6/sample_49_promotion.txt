**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**  
   While not strongly negative, I find it neutral to slightly favorable due to its straightforward messaging but lack of personal resonance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**  
   The promise of energy and looking good can pique interest for busy professionals like me, though it's fairly generic.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**  
   On balance, I see value in its claims about energy levels and appearance; however, thereâ€™s no compelling uniqueness or emotional connection here.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**  
   It falls short on visual appeal or engaging storytelling for me to be strongly attracted.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**  
   Neutral lean towards no intention; I don't feel a strong enough need right now despite its benefits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**  
   There's mild curiosity but not enough push to make an immediate effort in purchasing it.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**  
   I'm open to the possibility given future needs or if other factors change, though current interest is low.

Overall, while acknowledging its appeal for maintaining energy and appearance, my personal traits emphasize practicality over instant enthusiasm, leading to moderate engagement without strong purchase intent.
