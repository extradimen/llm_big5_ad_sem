**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad (score = 4):** While I appreciate the idea of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't resonate deeply with me.
    - **I think the ad is interesting (score = 3):** It’s not particularly engaging or unique enough to catch my attention consistently.
    - **I believe the ad is good (score = 5):** On a neutral-to-positive level, I see some value in its message but find it generic compared to other options.
    - **I find the ad attractive (score = 2):** The imagery and overall presentation are average; nothing stands out compellingly.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1):** Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and the perceived high cost of energy drinks, I have no immediate intention.
    - **Will try to buy this product (score = 2):** Although slightly higher than intent, trying it out isn't a priority due to other concerns like budget management and skepticism about its efficacy.
    - **Will consider buying this product (score = 3):** There’s a slight openness to considering it if the situation changes or I encounter compelling discounts/reviews.

Overall, while acknowledging some positive aspects of the ad's message, my current circumstances and personality traits don't drive strong purchase intentions. The scores reflect moderate interest but low actionable intent.
