**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) – The statement is somewhat compelling but lacks personal relevance; it feels slightly generic.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (4) – It sparks curiosity, especially given my strong imaginative trait.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral to Slightly Positive (5) – Adequate messaging on staying energized and refreshed resonates partially but could be more compelling.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (2) – The visual or emotional appeal might not strongly align with my reserved, cautious personality.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1) – Despite its message, I am naturally careful and thorough about health products.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Neutral/Inclined (2) – Open-minded curiosity might lead me to give it a trial but not with strong conviction.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Agree (3) – Given my unselfish nature, I may weigh its potential benefits for others even if personal interest is low.

Overall, the ad effectively captures some aspects of well-being concern but falls short in deeply engaging someone like me who prioritizes thoroughness and practicality. Thus, a cautious yet slightly open approach to considering it rather than immediate purchase intent.
