**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Score = 5)**: While not strongly inclined towards liking it, there is an appreciation for how straightforwardly it addresses fatigue and dullness, resonating with daily struggles of physical work.
   - **Interesting (Score = 6)**: The claim captures attention, especially given its relevance to my active lifestyle. However, the simplicity might limit engagement without compelling visuals or emotional storytelling.
   - **Good (Score = 4)**: It conveys a clear benefit effectively but lacks depth in explaining how the drink achieves this effect, leaving room for skepticism.
   - **Attractive (Score = 3)**: The adâ€™s message is somewhat attractive due to its alignment with my need to stay alert and energetic. However, it doesn't emotionally engage me strongly.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (Score = 2)**: Although the idea appeals, I am not convinced enough by just this advertisement; additional information or reviews would sway me.
   - **Try (Score = 3)**: There is a moderate urge to give it a try given its potential benefits and the fact that fatigue impacts my work directly. 
   - **Consider (Score = 5)**: The ad definitely prompts consideration, making me more open to exploring this product in comparison with alternatives I already use or have tried.

**Overall Response:** While not entirely captivated by the advertisement, it does highlight a real need and piques interest enough for further investigation. The combination of my outgoing nature, trustful mindset (Strongly Agree), and strong planning habits makes me open to new products that promise relief from everyday stressors, provided there is credible evidence supporting its efficacy.
