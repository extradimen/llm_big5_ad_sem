**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Despite being talkative and having a somewhat open personality, I don't find it very appealing on an emotional level (Score: 2).
   - **Interesting:** The message feels ordinary; not particularly engaging given my neutral perspective towards social interactions (Score: 3).
   - **Good:** It’s credible in terms of health claims but doesn’t strongly resonate with me due to mixed feelings about promises for appearance (Score: 4).
   - **Attractive:** While the idea of staying energized is attractive, I am more inclined by practical benefits than aesthetic improvements (Score: 5).

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** The product seems useful but not a high priority; my tendency towards being careless and worrying may affect long-term commitment (Score: 6).
   - **Try to Buy:** There’s mild curiosity, but I’m hesitant due to past experiences with inconsistent results from such products (Score: 4).
   - **Consider Buying:** While the energy boost is desirable, other priorities in my life might take precedence; hence a cautious consideration without strong intention (Score: 3).

Overall, while intrigued by practical benefits, personal traits like being sometimes rude, nervousness, and tendency towards carelessness slightly dampen enthusiasm. Thus, there's low-to-moderate intent to purchase but genuine interest for potential trial.
