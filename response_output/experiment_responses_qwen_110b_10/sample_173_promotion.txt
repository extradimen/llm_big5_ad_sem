Explanation:

- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad: 5. The ad's message is appealing on a surface level because it promises energy and looking one's best.
  - I think the ad is interesting: 4. While not groundbreaking, it captures my attention with its promise of benefits.
  - I believe the ad is good: 3. It's generic but effective; however, as a critical consumer, I am not fully convinced by vague health or beauty claims without specifics.
  - I find the ad attractive: 4. The promise of vitality and beauty is visually appealing, though it lacks unique visual elements.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product: 2. Despite liking some aspects, there's not enough information to trigger an immediate intent to buy.
  - I will try to buy this product: 3. There might be curiosity but not strong enough commitment without more evidence or personal testimonials.
  - I will consider buying this product: 4. The ad plants a seed of interest, so it would be among the options considered in the future, especially if additional information aligns with my values and needs.
