Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 60+ year old Chinese male civil servant with a postgraduate degree. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'll consider the demographic and personality traits. He's over 60, married, high income, but disagrees with being talkative or outgoing—more reserved. He strongly agrees he's trusting but also worries a lot. He's emotionally stable but disagrees with being careless. He's not into artistic interests or original ideas.

Hmm, the ad is about a drink for energy and looking good. At his age, he might be skeptical of such claims. Older people often prefer proven methods over quick fixes. Since he's a civil servant, he might value reliability and evidence. The ad is vague—no specifics on ingredients or how it works. That could trigger his worry tendency. He strongly agrees he worries a lot, so unsubstantiated claims might make him doubt the product.

He's reserved and not very sociable, so flashy or hype-driven ads probably don't appeal to him. He disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so maybe he's pragmatic. The ad's focus on "look your best" might not resonate; older men might care more about health than appearance. Also, he has few artistic interests, so aesthetic appeal of the ad isn't a big factor.

He's emotionally stable and doesn't get nervous easily, but he worries a lot. So the ad's promise might seem too good to be true, increasing skepticism. As a civil servant, he might prioritize factual information over emotional appeals. The ad lacks concrete details, which could make him see it as unprofessional or manipulative.

For attitude scores: 
- Like: He'd probably dislike it (low score) because it's not credible. 
- Interesting: Maybe neutral, but likely low since it's not substantive. 
- Good: He'd think it's a poor ad (low). 
- Attractive: Unlikely, given his reserved nature and focus on substance.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to purchase: Very low; he wouldn't trust such a vague claim. 
- Try to buy: Still low; he's thorough (though neutral on that trait), but the ad doesn't provide enough info. 
- Consider: Maybe slightly higher if he's trusting, but his worry tendency and skepticism would dominate. Still low.

Wait, he strongly agrees he's trusting, but also worries a lot. The worry might override trust here because the ad lacks proof. High income means he can afford it, but he'd want justification. As a civil servant, he might prefer government-approved health products, not random drinks.

Also, the ad's focus on "every day" might not align with his routine. At 60+, he might have established habits. "Stay energized" could be relevant, but without specifics, it's unconvincing. "Look your best" might feel shallow for his age group.

So scores would be low across the board. Maybe 1s and 2s for attitude, and 1s for purchase intent. Let me double-check the traits: He disagrees with making plans and following through, but that's more about personal habits, not product evaluation. His strong emotional stability might prevent panic, but skepticism remains.

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1-2), purchase intent all very low (1).
