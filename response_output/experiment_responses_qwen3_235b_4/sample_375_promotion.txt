Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate an ad from the perspective of a specific demographic and personality profile. The user provided a detailed profile: Chinese male over 60, postgraduate civil servant, divorced, high income. His personality traits are a mix—agrees he's outgoing but strongly agrees he's reserved, which is interesting. He's helpful but untrusting, sometimes rude, makes plans but doesn't do thorough jobs, gets nervous and worries a lot, not imaginative but original in ideas, neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. First, I need to think how this ad would resonate with him. 

Looking at his traits: He's a civil servant, so maybe skeptical of commercial claims. He strongly disagrees with being generally trusting, so he'd probably doubt the ad's claims. Also, he worries a lot and gets nervous easily, so vague promises like "stay energized" might not convince him—lacks specifics. 

He's reserved but outgoing? Wait, he agrees to being outgoing/sociable but strongly agrees to being reserved. That seems contradictory, but maybe he's selectively sociable. Still, as a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, he might value evidence over fluff. The ad is very generic—no ingredients, no proof. He'd likely find it unconvincing. 

His income is high (over 46M VND/month), so he's not desperate for energy drinks, but he might prioritize health. However, the ad says "look your best," which could feel superficial to someone his age and profession. Older Chinese men might prefer traditional remedies over commercial drinks. 

Personality-wise: He's not thorough (disagrees with doing thorough jobs), so he might not research the product, but his untrustworthiness (strongly disagrees on trusting) means he'd dismiss it immediately. He's helpful but rude sometimes—maybe he'd scoff at the ad's simplicity. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like: He wouldn't. It's too vague, no credibility. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting: Neutral? But he strongly disagrees with having an active imagination, so probably not engaging. Maybe 1 or 2. 
- Good: He'd think it's poor quality—no substance. Strongly disagree (1). 
- Attractive: As a reserved person, flashy ads annoy him. Plus, "look your best" might feel vain. 1 or 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy: Absolutely not. He's skeptical and high-income—has better options. 1. 
- Will try: Unlikely. He worries a lot; might fear side effects. 1. 
- Will consider: Maybe if there's proof, but ad offers none. His "make plans" trait (strongly agree) means he'd research, but ad doesn't prompt that. Still, low—2. 

Wait, but he's original and comes up with new ideas (agrees). Could that make him curious? Unlikely—the ad isn't innovative; it's cliché. His neutrality on artistic interests also suggests he's practical. 

Also, as a divorced civil servant over 60, "look your best" might not resonate—less focus on appearance at that age/life stage. Energy? Maybe, but generic claims won't cut it. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1-2), purchase intention very low (1-2). Let's map: 
- Like: 2 (slightly above worst but still dislike) 
- Interesting: 1 (strongly disagree it's interesting) 
- Good: 1 
- Attractive: 1 
- Intend: 1 
- Try: 1 
- Consider: 2 (tiny chance if pressured, but unlikely) 

Yes, that fits his distrustful, reserved, and critical nature.
