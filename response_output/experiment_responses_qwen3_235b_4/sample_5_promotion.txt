Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese male blue-collar worker with given traits, reacting to an energy drink ad. 

First, looking at the demographic: 20-29yo, bachelor's degree but blue-collar job? That's interesting - maybe he's in a skilled trade despite the degree. Lives with parents, earns 36-45 million VND monthly (which is actually high for Vietnam, so maybe this is a special case or typo? But I'll roll with it). 

Key personality traits jump out:
- Strongly agrees he's sometimes rude (that's unusual for a blue-collar worker stereotype)
- Strongly agrees he does thorough work (good work ethic)
- But strongly disagrees about following plans (impulsive?)
- Strongly agrees he gets nervous/worries a lot (high anxiety)
- Strongly disagrees he's emotionally stable (so very emotionally volatile)
- Strongly agrees he has few artistic interests (practical guy)

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone with high anxiety who worries a lot, "stay energized" might actually sound stressful - he probably craves calmness, not more energy. And "look your best" feels superficial to someone with no artistic interests. 

Also noting he's generally untrusting (disagrees with trusting others) and rude sometimes - he'll likely see this as exaggerated marketing BS. The "look your best" part especially feels fake to a blue-collar worker who probably deals with real physical labor all day. 

For attitude scores:
- Like? Nah, he'd roll his eyes at the "look your best" fluff. Maybe a 2.
- Interesting? Zero - it's generic as hell. 1.
- Good ad? Disagrees strongly with "good" since he thinks ads are manipulative. 1.
- Attractive? Not to this no-nonsense, anxious guy. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not - he's untrusting and the ad feels irrelevant. 1.
- Will try? Maybe if coworkers are drinking it, but the ad itself won't push him. Still 1.
- Will consider? Only if it's cheap at the convenience store after work, but the ad didn't help. 2 max.

Wait - his high income (for Vietnam) might make him less price-sensitive, but his personality overrides that. He's too anxious and distrustful to be swayed by such a shallow claim. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Strongly agree I'm sometimes rude" means he'd probably mock ads like this to friends. 
- "Worry a lot" - he might actually fear side effects of energy drinks. 
- "Few artistic interests" confirms he hates the "look your best" angle. 

Yep, scores should be brutally low. Only "consider" gets a 2 because... well, maybe if it's on sale at 7-Eleven after his shift.
