Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. The demographic profile says: Chinese male, 40-49, bachelor's degree, office worker, divorced, income 36-45 million VND/month. Personality traits are key here—I need to embody those.

Looking at the personality traits: He agrees he's talkative but disagrees with being outgoing/sociable? That's interesting—maybe he talks a lot in specific contexts but isn't broadly social. Strongly disagrees with being reserved, so he's probably expressive. Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and sometimes rude, but neutral on trusting. Hmm, seems self-focused but not intentionally rude. 

Big red flags: Strongly disagrees with "do a thorough job" and "make plans/follow through." That screams disorganization or impulsiveness. But he disagrees with "tend to be careless," which is contradictory—maybe he doesn't see himself as careless despite lacking follow-through. Worries a lot (agrees), emotionally unstable (disagrees? Wait no—he *disagrees* with "emotionally stable," meaning he *is* unstable). High imagination and originality (strongly agrees), but agrees he has few artistic interests? That's odd—maybe he's idea-focused but not into traditional arts. 

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Generic energy/beauty claim. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": He's imaginative/original but distrustful (neutral on trusting). This ad feels shallow to him—no substance for his creative mind. Probably scores low (2). 
- "Interesting": With active imagination, he'd crave novelty, but this is cliché. "Stay energized/look best" is overused. Not interesting (2). 
- "Good ad": He's critical (worries a lot, emotionally unstable), sees through fluff. Dislikes lack of specificity. Strong disagree on thoroughness means he spots lazy claims. Very low (1). 
- "Attractive": He's divorced, mid-40s office worker—might care about appearance, but the ad feels insincere. Neutral at best, but his distrust pushes it down (2). 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy": Zero. He's untrusting and unimpressed. Disagrees with helpfulness, so no altruistic trial. Income is decent but he's not impulsive (disagrees with careless, but... wait, he *disagrees* with "tend to be careless," so he thinks he's careful? Yet strongly disagrees with planning/follow-through. Contradiction—maybe he *wants* to be careful but isn't. Still, ad doesn't convince him. Score 1. 
- "Will try": Why would he? No unique hook. He worries a lot—might fear side effects or scams. Score 1. 
- "Will consider": Only if forced, but ad gives zero reason. His imagination might spin alternatives, but this ad is too vague. Maybe a reluctant 2? But... he's emotionally unstable (disagrees with stable), so mood swings might make him flip-flop. Still, baseline skepticism wins. Score 1. 

Wait—personality says "disagree" for "emotionally stable," meaning he *is* unstable. So he's anxious (worries a lot), which amplifies distrust. Ad feels like empty marketing. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all very low (1-2), purchase intention rock bottom (1s). Only "consider" might scrape a 2 if he's *forced* to think about it, but he won't. Stick with 1s for purchase.
