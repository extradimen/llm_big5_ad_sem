Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese blue-collar worker persona and evaluate an energy drink ad based on their psychological profile. 

First, I need to internalize the demographic: 30-39yo male, married, bachelor's degree but blue-collar job in Vietnam with 16-25M VND monthly income. That's actually quite high for blue-collar in Vietnam - maybe skilled technician? Important context for how he'd view premium products.

Now the personality traits are crucial here. He's:
- Reserved (Agree) and not talkative (Disagree) → introverted
- Not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree) and sometimes rude (Strongly Agree) → cynical, maybe jaded
- Worries a lot (Agree) but emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree) → anxious but denies it?
- Has active imagination (Strongly Agree) but few artistic interests (Disagree) → practical creativity?

Hmm... the ad says "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "energized" might resonate but "look your best" feels superficial. His personality suggests he'd scoff at vanity claims.

Breaking down ad attitude:
1. "I like the ad" → He's cynical (Strongly Disagrees on helpfulness) and rude. Probably thinks it's shallow. Score: 2 (Disagree)
2. "Interesting" → His active imagination might engage, but "look your best" seems irrelevant to his work boots-and-hard-hat reality. Neutral at best: 3
3. "Believe it's good" → He distrusts others (Disagree on trusting) and worries a lot. Will assume it's exaggerated: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
4. "Attractive" → Reserved + not sociable. Visual appeal won't move him: 2

Purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" → He's emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagrees) meaning he's volatile, but also thorough? Wait no - he Disagrees on "do a thorough job." Likely impulsive but skeptical. Won't commit: 1
2. "Will try" → Might sample if cheap/free, but his rudeness suggests low patience for gimmicks: 2
3. "Will consider" → His anxiety (Agree on worrying) might make him overthink, but distrust kills consideration: 1

Wait - his "tend to be careless" is Strongly Disagreed. So he's actually meticulous? But "do a thorough job" is Disagreed... contradiction? Maybe he thinks he's careful but isn't. Still, for a product claim, his distrust dominates.

Key insight: Blue-collar workers in Vietnam often prefer practical solutions (like strong coffee) over "looks" claims. His high income suggests he could afford it, but personality screams "this is for vain office workers, not me."

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. The "look your best" angle is especially alienating for someone who probably takes pride in manual work, not appearance.
