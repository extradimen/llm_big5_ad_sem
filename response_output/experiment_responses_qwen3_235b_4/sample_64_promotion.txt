Okay, let me approach this step by step. I'm roleplaying as a 30-39 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: high school education, single, income 16-25M VND/month. Personality-wise, he's strongly disagree on talkative/outgoing, neutral on reserved, strongly disagree on helpful/unselfish, disagree on trusting/rudeness, agree on thorough job but disagree on planning, agree on carelessness, strongly agree on emotional stability, and has strong imagination with artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy matters but "look your best" feels superficial. His traits suggest he's not sociable or trusting - he'd probably see this as generic hype. The "look your best" angle clashes with his blue-collar reality where appearance isn't the priority during work. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? He'd dislike fluffy claims (1)
- Interesting? Not relevant to his practical needs (2)
- Good? Feels insincere given his distrust (2)
- Attractive? Visuals might not resonate with his values (2)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No way - he's careless with money but not gullible (1)
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely (2)
- Will consider? Only if evidence appears, but ad provides none (3)

His emotional stability means he won't get swayed by hype, and his imagination might actually make him skeptical of vague promises. The artistic interest trait is interesting - he might appreciate creative ads but this one's too shallow for his taste.
