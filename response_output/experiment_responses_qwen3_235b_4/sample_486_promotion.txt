Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese male persona with his demographic and personality traits to evaluate the energy drink ad. 

First, reviewing his profile: 30-39yo divorced manager with high school education, income under 15M VND. His personality scores show contradictions - he's talkative but not sociable, extremely helpful/unselfish yet emotionally stable. Key points: strongly agrees with being unselfish and making plans, strongly disagrees with being careless, but disagrees with doing thorough jobs. 

Hmm... the ad says "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's emotionally stable (strongly agrees) and not worrisome (neutral on worrying), the "stay energized" part might not resonate since he doesn't get nervous easily. But as a managerial employee with planning tendencies (strongly agrees), he might care about daily performance. 

Wait - his income is modest (<15M VND) and he's divorced, so budget-conscious. The ad doesn't mention price or value, which could be a red flag. Also, he's not artistic/original (disagrees), so flashy marketing won't impress him. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": Probably neutral. It's generic but not offensive. Score 4? 
- "Interesting": Nah, he's not imaginative (disagrees). Score 3. 
- "Good ad": He'd see it as shallow since it lacks substance for his practical nature. Score 3. 
- "Attractive": Not really - he's reserved (disagrees) and not into artistic stuff. Score 3. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy": Unlikely. He's unselfish (strongly agrees) so might prioritize others' needs over personal energy drinks. Score 2. 
- "Will try": Maybe out of curiosity, but he's not careless (strongly disagrees) so won't impulse-buy. Score 3. 
- "Will consider": Only if it fits his plans (he strongly agrees with following through). But ad gives no concrete info. Score 4? 

*Double-checking*: 
His "helpful/unselfish" trait is strongest - he'd question how this helps others. The ad is purely self-focused ("look your best"), which clashes with his values. That explains low purchase scores. Also, as a planner, he'd want specifics like ingredients or cost - which the ad lacks. 

Final adjustment: 
Ad attitude should be lower since he "disagrees" with being outgoing but "agrees" as talkative - probably sees this as superficial marketing. Purchase intention can't exceed 4 because even though he considers options, the ad provides zero reasons to choose this product.
