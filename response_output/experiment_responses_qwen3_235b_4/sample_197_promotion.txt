Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. The profile describes a 50-59 year old Chinese male civil servant with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits are quite mixed: strongly agrees he's outgoing/sociable but also reserved (that's interesting - maybe he's selectively social?), disagrees he's helpful/unselfish, strongly distrusts others, admits to being sometimes rude, and has anxiety traits like worrying a lot. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant in his 50s, he's probably skeptical of health claims - government workers tend to see through marketing fluff. His "strongly disagree" on trust and "agree" on nervousness/worrying suggest he'd question this ad's credibility immediately. 

Also noting his income is solid but not ultra-rich (36-45M VND ≈ $1,500-$1,800 USD), and as a bachelor with artistic interests ("agree" on few artistic interests), he might prioritize practicality over "looking your best" claims. His "disagree" on being helpful/unselfish hints he's pragmatic - why would he care about an ad targeting vanity? 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" → Probably 1-2. He's cynical (strongly distrustful) and the ad feels superficial to him. 
- "Interesting" → Maybe 3? His "active imagination" could make him ponder it briefly, but "rude/careless" traits mean he'd dismiss it fast. 
- "Good" → 1. He values thoroughness ("neutral" on doing thorough job) but this ad lacks substance. 
- "Attractive" → 2. His reserved side might appreciate simplicity, but "look your best" clashes with his unselfishness disagreement. 

Purchase intention: 
Zero chance he'd buy this. His "disagree" on helpfulness means he won't see value in "energized/look best" promises. Civil servants are cautious with spending - he'd think "Why waste money on drinks when tea works?" Especially with his "worry a lot" trait - he'd fear side effects. All scores 1. 

*Double-checking*: His "agree" on making plans suggests he'd research proper supplements instead of trusting ads. Yep, scores stay low.
