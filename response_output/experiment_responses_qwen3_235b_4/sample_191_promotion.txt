Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male civil servant persona with very particular traits to evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to internalize this character profile: 20s male, postgrad civil servant in China, under 15M VND monthly income (which is actually quite low for a postgrad civil servant - might indicate lower-tier city or junior position). Key personality flags: not trusting (strongly disagree), not helpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), worrier (agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), not artistic. Neutral on sociability but dislikes thorough planning (strongly disagree on follow-through).

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant? That's interesting. Their job isn't physically demanding like construction work, so "stay energized" feels irrelevant. And "look your best" - civil service uniforms hide appearance, plus he's got low artistic interest (agrees with having few artistic interests). 

*checks income* Under 15M VND is about $600 USD - tight for a city dweller. He'd be skeptical of premium-priced energy drinks. His "strongly disagree" on trusting others means he'll instantly question this claim. No "active imagination" either - won't fantasize about benefits. 

Big red flag: he "strongly disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish. This isn't someone who buys into "for your best self" messaging. The ad feels superficial to him. His worry tendency (agrees) makes him focus on hidden costs or side effects, not benefits. 

Also... civil servants in China follow strict protocols. Random energy drinks? Might even seem unprofessional. He'd prefer tea or coffee - culturally ingrained. "Look your best" is almost insulting when you wear a uniform daily. 

*scoring logic* 
Ad attitude: All low. "Like"=2 (barely tolerates it), "interesting"=1 (boring corporate fluff), "good"=1 (feels manipulative), "attractive"=1 (zero visual appeal for him). 
Purchase: "Intend"=1 (no way), "try"=1 (won't risk it), "consider"=2 (only because he worries about alternatives, not interest). 

Wait - "consider" gets a 2? Yes. His worry trait (agree) means he'll overthink options... but still reject this. Not because he likes it, but because anxiety makes him analyze everything. Classic his profile.
