Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, living with my parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not talkative (strongly disagree), somewhat reserved (neutral), and tend to worry a lot (agree). I'm generally trusting but careless, and I don't do thorough jobs.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who worries a lot but isn't particularly sociable, I'd be skeptical. The claim seems too vague - "look your best" is such a generic promise. With my postgraduate education, I'd expect more concrete evidence. 

Since I tend to be careless and don't follow through on plans, this "every day" promise feels unrealistic for me. I'm emotionally neutral but worry-prone, so I might actually stress about whether it really works. The ad doesn't address any specific concerns I'd have - like ingredients, scientific backing, or how it fits with my routine living with parents.

For attitude scores: 
- Like? No, it feels shallow (1)
- Interesting? Not really, too generic (2)
- Good? Lacks substance for my education level (2)
- Attractive? Visually maybe okay but message is weak (3)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not with these claims (1)
- Will try? Maybe if I saw proof, but not from this ad (2)
- Consider? Only if I found more info elsewhere (3)

I'm generally trusting but my worry tendency makes me doubt such broad claims. The ad feels targeted at younger people - not someone my age living with parents. My high income means I'm selective, and this doesn't feel premium enough.
