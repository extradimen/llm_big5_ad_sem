Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese female office worker with very specific traits. Her profile shows she's highly educated (postgrad), single, high-income (>46M VND/month), but with some contradictory personality markers that are crucial here.

First, unpacking her personality contradictions: 
- She's sociable (Agree) but not selfless (Strongly Disagree) - that's interesting. Most outgoing people lean toward helpfulness, but she's explicitly unselfish? Wait no, the trait says "Strongly Disagree" with being helpful/unselfish. So she's probably quite self-focused despite being talkative. 
- Major red flags: Strongly Disagrees with "do a thorough job" but Strongly Disagrees with "tend to be careless"? That's logically inconsistent. Maybe she sees herself as meticulous but hates routine tasks? 
- The anxiety markers jump out: Strongly Agrees "get nervous easily", Agrees "worry a lot", Strongly Disagrees "emotionally stable". This is a high-anxiety person despite her professional success.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic functional benefit claim with a vanity angle ("look your best"). 

Why would she hate this?
- Her income is very high (>46M VND is top 5% in China), so energy drinks are probably beneath her status. She'd use premium wellness solutions, not mass-market drinks.
- Her neuroticism (worry/anxiety) means she'd scrutinize claims. "Helps you stay energized" sounds vague and unscientific to a postgrad. She'd demand clinical evidence.
- "Look your best" triggers her insecurity (she's 40-49, unmarried in Chinese context) but her pride would reject such superficial promises. She Strongly Disagrees with being emotionally stable - this ad feels like it's mocking her daily struggles.

Purchase intention is zero because:
- She's financially secure enough to afford better solutions
- Her "helpful/unselfish" Strong Disagree suggests no altruistic motivation to "treat herself"
- Her disorganization ("make plans Disagree") means she won't bother seeking it out

The scores practically write themselves:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because she's critical, anxious, and sees through shallow claims. 
Purchase: Absolute no (1s) - she'd consider this for teenagers, not for a sophisticated office professional.

Wait - her "original ideas Strongly Agree" might make her appreciate creativity, but this ad is generic as hell. No novelty here to trigger her imagination. Neutral artistic interest also means no aesthetic appeal.

Final calibration: 
- "Attractive" might be 2 instead of 1 because she's sociable, but no... the ad's simplicity feels insulting to her intellect. Definitely 1s across ad attitude except maybe "interesting" at 2 since she worries a lot - but nah, anxiety makes her dismiss it faster.
- Purchase intention can't be higher than 1. She Strongly Disagrees with thoroughness, but that means she'd skip research, not impulsively buy.
