Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific person based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll go through the demographic profile. The person is a Chinese female over 60, with a postgraduate degree. She's living with her parents, has a high monthly income (over 46 million VND), but her occupation is listed as "Other." Interesting. Her personality traits are key here. She disagrees with being talkative, neutral on outgoing/sociable, agrees with being reserved. She strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting. Disagrees with being rude. Strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job and being careless. Strongly agrees with getting nervous easily but strongly disagrees with worrying a lot. Agrees with being emotionally stable. Strongly disagrees with having an active imagination, being original, and having few artistic interests—wait, no, she strongly disagrees with "I have few artistic interests," which means she actually has many artistic interests. That's important.

Now, the ad is about a drink for energy and looking good. As a 60+ woman with high education, she's probably skeptical of such claims. She's reserved and not outgoing, so flashy ads might not appeal. She's trusting but also gets nervous easily. However, she strongly disagrees with worrying a lot and is emotionally stable, so maybe not overly anxious. But she's critical (postgrad degree) and values thoroughness—she strongly disagrees with "I do a thorough job," which is confusing. Wait, the trait is "I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree." So she does NOT do a thorough job? That seems odd for a postgrad, but maybe she's self-critical. Or perhaps it's a translation issue. Hmm. But she also strongly disagrees with "I tend to be careless," so she's not careless. Contradiction? Maybe she thinks she's thorough but the trait says she strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job. Wait, the trait is phrased as "I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree." So she believes she does NOT do a thorough job. But she also says "I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree." So she's not careless but also doesn't do a thorough job? That's confusing. Maybe in context, she's meticulous but doesn't follow through? But she strongly agrees with "I make plans and follow through with them." So she plans and follows through but doesn't do a thorough job? This is tricky.

Focusing on the ad. "Stay energized and look your best every day." For a woman over 60, "look your best" might feel ageist or irrelevant. She might prefer natural aging. High income but living with parents—maybe she's frugal or values family over personal spending. She's helpful/unselfish, so might prioritize others' needs over her own. The ad is promoting a personal product, which might not align with her unselfish trait.

She has many artistic interests (since she strongly disagrees with "I have few artistic interests"), so maybe she values creativity, but the ad is very functional (energy and looks). Not appealing to her artistic side.

She's reserved, so flashy or hype-driven ads might turn her off. She gets nervous easily—maybe the ad's claims feel overwhelming or too good to be true, causing anxiety. But she's emotionally stable and doesn't worry a lot, so maybe not. However, as a critical thinker (postgrad), she'd question the ad's credibility. "Helps you stay energized"—vague claim. No specifics, so she might find it unconvincing.

Purchase intention: High income, but she's living with parents, possibly frugal. She might not see the need for such a drink, especially if she's healthy. Also, her unselfish nature might make her less focused on personal beauty/energy products.

Scoring the ad attitude:

1. Like the ad: She's reserved, critical, artistic. The ad is probably too generic. Score low, maybe 2.
2. Interesting: Doesn't have an active imagination, not original. Ad is cliché. 1 or 2.
3. Believes it's good: As a critical postgrad, she'd find it lacking substance. 1.
4. Attractive: She's reserved, artistic, but the ad isn't artistic. Not appealing. 2.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely. She's unselfish, critical, probably healthy at 60+. 1.
2. Will try: Maybe out of curiosity, but skeptical. Still low. 2.
3. Will consider: Given her thoroughness? Wait, she strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job, but she follows through on plans. However, the ad lacks credibility. Probably not. 1 or 2. But "consider" might be slightly higher. Maybe 2.

Wait, she strongly agrees with making plans and following through, but strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job. So she plans but doesn't execute thoroughly? That's odd. But as a postgrad, she's likely analytical. So she'd consider options but find this ad unconvincing.

Also, high income but living with parents—maybe she spends on family, not personal luxuries. The drink might seem unnecessary.

She's trusting (strongly agrees), so if the brand is reputable, maybe? But the ad itself is barebones. No brand mentioned, just the claim. So she might not trust it without evidence.

Her nervousness: "get nervous easily" but "emotionally stable" and "don't worry a lot." Contradictory? Maybe she gets nervous in social situations but is generally stable. The ad might not trigger anxiety, but she'd still be skeptical.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: low across the board. 1-2.

Purchase intention: very low. 1-2.

Specifically:

Ad attitude:
- Like: 2 (slightly above lowest because she's trusting, but still not positive)
- Interesting: 1 (strongly disagrees with active imagination, so not engaging)
- Good: 1 (doesn't do thorough job herself but would recognize poor ad quality)
- Attractive: 2 (artistic interests, but ad isn't artistic; maybe neutral but leaning negative)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1
- Try: 1 (she follows through on plans, but no reason to start)
- Consider: 2 (as a planner, might briefly consider but dismiss)

Wait, she strongly agrees with making plans and following through. So "will consider" might be higher? But the ad is so unconvincing that even a planner would dismiss it quickly. Considering implies some merit, which she likely doesn't see.

So purchase scores: 1,1,1? But maybe "consider" is slightly higher. Standard practice in such scales is that "consider" is more lenient. Even if unlikely, people might say they'd consider. But given her traits—critical, unselfish, artistic—she probably wouldn't waste mental energy considering it. So all 1s? Or 1,1,2.

Looking at the instruction: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy." But she doesn't like the ad.

Also, note that she has high income but might not care for such products. As a 60+ woman, she might prioritize health differently—maybe prefers natural methods over drinks.

Final scores:

Ad attitude: [2,1,1,2] ? Or all low.

Wait, she strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish. The ad is selfish-focused ("look your best"), which clashes with her values. So she'd dislike the ad's message.

Therefore:

- Like: 1 (strongly disagree)
- Interesting: 1
- Good: 1
- Attractive: 1 (but maybe 2 because she's artistic? No, the ad isn't artistic. She has artistic interests but the ad doesn't cater to that, so not attractive.)

But she strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests, meaning she has many. So an ad that's artistically done might appeal, but this ad is a plain text claim. So not attractive.

Thus ad attitude: all 1s? But 1 is "strongly disagree" meaning she strongly disagrees that she likes it, etc. So scores of 1 mean very negative.

But the scale is 1=strongly disagree (with the statement "I like the ad"), so 1 means she strongly dislikes it.

Yes.

But let's see: for a reserved, critical person, this ad is probably seen as shallow. So:

1. I like the ad: 1
2. Interesting: 1 (she has no active imagination, so not engaging)
3. Believes it's good: 1 (as a critical thinker)
4. Attractive: 1 (not aligned with her values)

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: 1
2. Try: 1
3. Consider: might be 2? Because she makes plans, but the ad gives no reason. However, "consider" is the weakest intention. Even if unlikely, people might say they'd consider. But given her traits, she'd dismiss it immediately. So 1.

But the instruction says: "It's perfectly fine to give low scores." And "You may like the ad but still not want to buy." But she doesn't like it.

Also, her high trust might make her give a tiny benefit of doubt? But the ad is so vague. As a postgrad, she'd demand evidence.

So all purchase scores 1.

But let's check similar examples. In ad response studies, "consider" is often higher than "intend" or "try." For instance, someone might consider trying something new but not actively intend to. So maybe "consider" is 2.

Given she's a planner (strongly agrees with making plans), she might at least consider it as an option, even if unlikely. But the ad provides no concrete info, so probably not. However, out of politeness or habit, "consider" might be slightly higher.

But she's reserved and critical, so unlikely. I think all 1s for purchase.

Wait, the personality says she strongly agrees with being trusting. So maybe she's more open to considering products? But the ad is very barebones. Without a brand or evidence, even a trusting person might not bite.

Still, trust might make "consider" a 2.

So:

Purchase: [1,1,2]

Ad attitude: [1,1,1,1]

But let's see the traits again. She's helpful/unselfish. The ad is about personal benefit, which might rub her the wrong way. So ad attitude all 1s.

Yes.
