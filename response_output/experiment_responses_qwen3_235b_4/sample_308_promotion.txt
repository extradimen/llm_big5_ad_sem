Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a 20-29 year old Chinese male office worker with high school education, single, low income, and specific personality traits. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Need to score attitude and purchase intention on 7-point scales.

First, looking at my demographic: low income (<15M VND/month), so expensive drinks are probably out of reach. As an office worker, I might feel tired from the job but also skeptical of quick fixes. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (Agree), not talkative (Disagree), outgoing but also disagree with being helpful/unselfish. Oh, and I strongly distrust others, sometimes rude, do thorough jobs but careless tendency, nervous/worrier. 

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): The ad feels generic. Since I'm reserved and distrustful (Strongly Disagree on trusting), I'd find it shallow. Probably low score like 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): With neutral on imagination/originality, and being a worrier, I might see it as another cliché ad. Maybe 3.
- "Good" (Q3): As someone who does thorough jobs (Strongly Agree) but careless (Agree), I'd question the claim. "Look your best" sounds unrealistic. Score 2.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Reserved personality + distrust → unimpressed by flashy promises. Likely 2.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): Low income + distrust → no way. Strong 1.
- "Will try to buy" (Q2): Even if curious, financial constraint (<15M VND) makes this impossible. Score 1.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Might glance at it in store but skepticism (worry a lot trait) kills interest. Maybe 2.

Key conflicts: 
- Outgoing but reserved? Hmm, Agree on both outgoing and reserved seems contradictory, but maybe means sociable in small groups only. Still, ad's "look your best" feels superficial for someone distrustful.
- "Stay energized" might appeal to tired office worker, but "look your best" triggers skepticism (worrier trait).
- Thorough job-doer would want proof, which ad lacks → low credibility.

Final scores: Ad attitude super low (distrust + thoroughness), purchase intention near zero (income + skepticism).
