Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of a Chinese woman over 60, married, with a bachelor's degree and working in an office. Her monthly income is between 26-35 million VND, which is actually quite high—maybe she's a senior executive or in a specialized field. Personality-wise, she's super talkative and outgoing (Strongly Agree on both), not reserved at all (Disagree), helpful but not overly trusting (Agree on helpful, Disagree on trusting). She's thorough and organized (Agree on doing thorough jobs and following plans), not careless (Strongly Disagree), emotionally... wait, she Strongly Disagrees with getting nervous easily but *Agrees* with worrying a lot and *Disagrees* with being emotionally stable? Hmm, that's interesting—sounds like she masks anxiety with outward calm. Also, she has an active imagination (Agree) but isn't big on originality or art (Disagrees on "original ideas" and "few artistic interests"—wait, no: she *Disagrees* with "I have few artistic interests," meaning she *does* have artistic interests. Got it.

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic. No brand, no specifics. 

For ad attitude: 
- *Like*: She's sociable and talkative, so she might appreciate upbeat ads, but this feels shallow. At her age, she's probably skeptical of "look your best" claims—might feel targeted at younger people. She worries a lot (Agree) and isn't trusting (Disagree), so she'd question if it's realistic. Score: low, like 2. 
- *Interesting*: She has an active imagination (Agree), but the ad is bland. No creativity here. She Disagrees with being original, but still—this ad lacks substance. Maybe a 3? 
- *Good*: She does thorough jobs (Agree) and follows plans (Agree), so she values credibility. This ad gives zero proof—no ingredients, no studies. She's not careless (Strongly Disagree), so she'd spot the fluff. "Good" implies quality; this feels cheap. Score: 2. 
- *Attractive*: She's not emotionally stable (Disagree) and worries a lot (Agree), so "look your best" might even stress her out (e.g., "Am I not looking my best now?"). Also, as a >60 woman, "look your best" ads often ignore her demographic. Not attractive at all. Score: 1.

Purchase intention: 
- *Intend to purchase*: She's thorough and unselfish (Agree on helpful), but this ad doesn't address her needs. Office workers her age might want energy for grandkids or work, but "look your best" feels irrelevant. She's not trusting (Disagree), so no way she'd commit. Score: 1. 
- *Try to buy*: Maybe if it were in her supermarket, but the ad gives no reason to seek it out. She follows plans (Agree), so impulse buys are unlikely. Score: 2. 
- *Consider buying*: Slight chance if she's curious, but her skepticism (Disagrees with trusting) and thoroughness mean she'd need way more info. Still, "consider" is the lowest bar... maybe a 3? But given her age and income, she probably has trusted routines—why switch? Hmm, 2 feels right.

Wait—her high income (26-35M VND is ~$1,100-$1,500 USD, which is *very* high for Vietnam; average is ~$300) means she's discerning. She won't fall for vague claims. Also, as a >60 woman in China/Vietnam (wait, region says "Chinese" but income in VND? Contradiction—probably a typo, but I'll assume Vietnamese context since income is in VND). In Vietnamese culture, older women might prioritize health over "looking best," and be wary of commercial hype. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2,3,2,1), purchase intention very low (1,2,2). She might *consider* it only if a trusted friend recommends it—but the ad alone? Nope.
