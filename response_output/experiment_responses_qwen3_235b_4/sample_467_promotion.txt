Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the persona described. She's a Chinese female over 60, with a postgraduate degree, working as an office worker, living with her parents, and earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are a mix: she's talkative (Agree), outgoing but neutral on sociability, strongly reserved, not helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), neutral on trusting, never rude (Strongly Disagree), neutral on thoroughness, strongly agrees on planning, neutral on carelessness, agrees on getting nervous, disagrees on worrying, strongly disagrees on emotional stability (so she's emotionally unstable), strongly agrees on active imagination, strongly disagrees on originality, and neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, evaluating her attitude toward the ad. She's reserved and emotionally unstable, which might make her skeptical. She has an active imagination but isn't original, so she might overthink the ad's claims. Since she's not helpful/unselfish and not trusting, she'd likely question the ad's credibility. Also, as an older office worker, she might prioritize health but be wary of exaggerated claims. 

For ad attitude scores:
1. I like the ad: She's reserved and critical, so probably low. Maybe 2.
2. Interesting: Her active imagination might find it somewhat intriguing, but skepticism pulls it down. Neutral? But since she's critical, maybe 3.
3. Believes it's good: She's not trusting, emotionally unstable, so likely disagrees. Strongly? Maybe 2.
4. Attractive: She's reserved, not artistic, so visuals might not appeal. Also, the ad is generic. Probably 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: She's practical, plans things, but skeptical. Unlikely. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Even lower since she's not impulsive. 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe a bit higher because she plans, but the ad lacks specifics. Still, as an older person, she might consider health products but this ad is too vague. Maybe 2.

Wait, her monthly income is high (26-35M VND), so affordability isn't an issue. But her personality traits (not trusting, emotionally unstable) override that. Also, she's over 60, so "look your best" might not resonateâ€”older adults might prioritize health over appearance. The ad feels superficial to her. 

Double-checking traits: Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish means she's self-focused, so she might care about personal benefits, but the ad's claim is too vague. She makes plans (Strongly Agree), so she might research instead of trusting an ad. 

Ad attitude scores: All low because she's critical and reserved. Purchase intention: Very low since the ad doesn't provide evidence or specifics she'd need as a planner. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all 2s except maybe "interesting" as 3? But her emotional instability and skepticism might make even "interesting" low. Stick with 2,2,2,2 for attitude. Purchase: 1,1,2. She might minimally consider it but no intention.
