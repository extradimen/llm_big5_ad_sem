Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, analyzing the demographic and personality traits: 
- Young Chinese male (under 20) with postgraduate degree seems statistically improbable since postgraduate studies typically start around 22+, but I'll accept the given profile. 
- Divorced under 20 is also unusual, but focusing on the traits provided.
- Key personality points: 
  * Strongly Disagrees with being talkative/reserved (contradictory but noted)
  * Strongly Agrees on trusting others 
  * Agrees on thoroughness but Neutral on planning
  * Strongly Disagrees on emotional stability (highly relevant)
  * Agrees on active imagination but Strongly Disagrees on originality

Now examining the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude evaluation:
1. "I like the ad" - As someone distrustful of simplistic claims (due to emotional instability trait implying skepticism), and with neutral sociability, this generic ad won't resonate. Score: 2 (Disagree)
2. "I think the ad is interesting" - Lacks creativity (despite active imagination trait, the ad is bland), no new ideas presented. Score: 3 (Neutral leaning negative)
3. "I believe the ad is good" - Professionally, as an office worker who "does thorough job", I'd question the lack of evidence. Strongly Agree on trusting others doesn't override professional skepticism. Score: 2
4. "I find the ad attractive" - With "few artistic interests" Disagreed (meaning some interest), but the ad has no visual description to judge. Defaulting to skepticism: Score 3

For purchase intention:
1. "I intend to purchase" - High income but emotionally unstable = impulsive yet skeptical. Generic claims won't trigger intent. Score: 1
2. "I will try to buy" - Trusting nature (Strongly Agree) might allow trial, but Neutral on helpfulness/unselfishness suggests self-focus. Still, too vague to commit. Score: 2
3. "I will consider buying" - As thorough worker (Agree), I'd research first. The ad provides zero substance to consider. Score: 3

Critical notes: 
- The ad's vagueness clashes with my "do a thorough job" trait
- Emotional instability (Strongly Disagree) makes me distrust "look your best" claims
- Postgraduate education implies expectation of evidence-based claims
- High income allows purchase but ad fails to justify value proposition

Final scores reflect professional skepticism overriding trusting nature, with minimal consideration due to lack of substance.
