Okay, let's break this down. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male student with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I need to fully understand who this person is.

Hmm, he's under 20 but already has a postgraduate degree? That's interesting—must be a prodigy or accelerated program. Divorced at that age is unusual but possible in some contexts. Monthly income of 16-25 million VND (about $650-$1000) makes sense for a student with scholarships or family support in Vietnam. 

Personality-wise, he's talkative and outgoing (Agree on both), but contradicts himself by strongly disagreeing with being reserved. Wait, that tracks—outgoing people usually aren't reserved. But then he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish? That's odd for a sociable person. Maybe he's self-centered despite being social. 

Key red flags: 
- Strongly disagrees with "do a thorough job" and "follow through with plans" → chronically disorganized? 
- But strongly disagrees with "tend to be careless" → thinks he's careful despite lacking follow-through? Classic overconfidence. 
- Neutral on nervousness but agrees he worries a lot? Contradiction—probably anxiety masked by emotional stability claim (he "strongly agrees" he's emotionally stable, which feels defensive). 
- Strongly agrees with creativity/artistic interests but strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests → redundant but emphasizes he's artsy. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

How would *he* react? 
- As a young, image-conscious (divorced at <20? yikes, probably cares about appearance), creative student: might initially like the "look your best" angle. 
- But he's untrustworthy ("disagree" on helpful/unselfish) and thinks ads are manipulative? Wait no—he "strongly agrees" he's generally trusting. Oh! So he's gullible despite worrying a lot. 
- However, he "strongly disagrees" with doing thorough jobs → won't research if the ad's claims are true. Might believe it superficially. 
- But he's original/creative ("strongly agree") → might find generic "stay energized" claims cliché and unoriginal. His artistic side would crave more imaginative messaging. 

Purchase intention: 
- Income is decent but he's a student → might splurge on trendy stuff. 
- But he doesn't follow through with plans → even if interested, won't actually buy. 
- "Worries a lot" → might overthink if it's worth the money. 

Scoring breakdown: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like: 4 (mildly appealing but generic) 
- Interesting: 3 (too basic for his creative mind) 
- Good: 3 (feels insincere because he worries about scams) 
- Attractive: 4 (visuals might catch his eye as artsy person) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: 2 (no follow-through habit) 
- Try: 3 (impulsive but worries about cost) 
- Consider: 4 (might think about it idly, per his daydreamy traits) 

Wait—his emotional stability ("strongly agree") might counteract worry? But he "agrees" he worries a lot... so anxiety wins. Also, divorced young suggests possible impulsivity → might try buying but not intend long-term. 

Final adjustment: 
- Ad like: 5? He's trusting and outgoing → might enjoy the vibe. But "unselfish" disagreement means he cares about personal gain → "look your best" appeals to vanity. Up to 5. 
- Purchase consider: 5 because he's imaginative (might fantasize about using it) but won't act. 

Nah, stick with initial logic. His creativity makes him dismiss clichés. Scores stay low-mid.
