Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this Chinese male office worker in his 40s with specific traits. His profile shows contradictions - strongly talkative but disagreeing with being outgoing/sociable, which suggests he talks a lot but only in certain contexts. The "reserved" agreement and "sometimes rude" strong agreement indicate social discomfort. Financially constrained (<15M VND/month while living with parents), he's probably pragmatic about spending.

Key personality red flags for the ad:
- "Strongly disagree" on being helpful/unselfish means he's skeptical of altruistic claims
- "Strongly agree" to worrying a lot + emotional instability suggests he'd distrust "look your best" promises
- "Disagree" on thoroughness but "agree" to careless tendencies implies he'd spot logical gaps easily
- "Strongly agree" to originality but "strongly agree" to few artistic interests - he values novelty but not fluff

The ad's claim "helps stay energized and look your best" hits multiple pain points:
- "Look your best" would trigger his worry trait (strongly agrees to worrying a lot)
- As someone emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable), he knows quick fixes don't work
- His rudeness trait ("strongly agree") makes him dismissive of superficial promises
- Low income means he'd question if it's worth the cost for vague benefits

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd hate the false positivity. His rudeness trait makes him reject "feel-good" ads.
- Interesting (2): Only mildly curious as an original thinker, but the claim is too generic.
- Good (1): "Thorough job" disagree + careless agree means he sees it as lazy advertising.
- Attractive (1): Reserved nature + no artistic interests = zero aesthetic appeal.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Financially cautious and distrustful. "Helpful/unselfish" strong disagree = won't spend on others' claims.
- Try (2): Might test if dirt cheap, but "worry a lot" makes him avoid unknowns.
- Consider (3): Originality trait ("strongly agree") means he'd entertain novel ideas, but barely.

The scores reflect his core conflict: talks a lot (strongly agree) but socially wary (reserved/agree), making him hyper-critical of ads targeting social confidence. Since he lives with parents, "look your best" might even stress him about family expectations.
