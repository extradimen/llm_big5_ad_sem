Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese civil servant with detailed demographics and personality traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad based on that persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this character: 25-year-old divorced male civil servant in China with high school education, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality is contradictory - strongly agree he's talkative but also strongly reserved? That's interesting. He strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, which suggests cynicism. But he agrees about doing thorough work and having new ideas, while strongly disagreeing about artistic interests. Key contradictions: talks a lot but reserved, claims emotional instability but disagrees about worrying/nervousness.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic vague health/beauty claim. For my persona:
- As a distrustful civil servant (Disagree on trusting others), I'd immediately question "how does it work?" 
- His strong disagreement with being unselfish means he won't care about community benefits
- The "look your best" angle might trigger his divorced status insecurity, but he'd mask it with cynicism
- Monthly income is decent but not luxury - he'd scrutinize value

Ad attitude breakdown:
1. Like the ad? He's cynical (Disagree on trusting) and finds rudeness neutral - probably thinks it's manipulative. Score 2.
2. Interesting? He has few artistic interests (Strongly Disagree) and inactive imagination - won't engage. Score 2.
3. Good ad? As a thorough worker (Agree) he'd note lack of evidence. Score 3.
4. Attractive? His reserved nature + distrust makes flashy ads unappealing. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
All divorced civil servants know "look your best" claims are shallow. His income allows purchase but:
- "Stay energized" might appeal to job demands, but...
- He disagrees about worrying yet strongly disagrees about emotional stability - meaning he has hidden stress but won't admit it. Might secretly consider it but won't admit in survey.
- Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish = won't buy for others
Final scores: 
- Intend: 1 (too proud to admit need)
- Try: 2 (maybe secretly)
- Consider: 3 (bare minimum for survey honesty)

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Original ideas (Agree) but inactive imagination? Contradiction resolved: he has practical ideas but no creativity for ads. 
- Emotionally unstable but not nervous? Means volatility without anxiety - might impulsively buy then regret. But survey asks current intention, so low scores stand.
