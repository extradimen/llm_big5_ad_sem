Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male student with detailed demographic and personality traits, then evaluate a simple energy drink ad using strict scoring rules.

First, I need to fully embody this persona. He's a 20-29yo married Chinese male student with bachelor's degree, earning over 46M VND monthly (which is unusually high for a student - might indicate family wealth or side business). His personality stands out: extremely extroverted (Strongly Agrees to talkative/sociable) but paradoxically Strongly Agrees to nervousness/worrying. Key contradictions: Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, Strongly Disagrees with thoroughness, yet Agrees to being careless. Not artistic, not imaginative, and Neutral on trust/emotional stability.

The ad is just "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic. Now, how would this specific person react?

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad": He's unselfish? Disagrees. So probably dislikes vague promises. Plus he's not artistic/original (Strongly Disagrees), so bland ads won't impress him. Score: 2 (Disagree)
- "Interesting": His personality says Neutral on imagination, Strongly Disagrees on originality. This ad is cliché - won't spark interest. Score: 2
- "Good ad": He makes plans but is careless (Agree), does poor work (Strongly Disagree). Might see through hollow claims. Score: 3 (leaning Neutral but skeptical)
- "Attractive": He's outgoing but nervous (Strongly Agrees). Generic ads feel untrustworthy to anxious people. Score: 2

Purchase intention is where it gets juicy. Despite high income, he's:
- Not thorough (Strongly Disagrees)
- Careless (Agrees)
- Unhelpful/unselfish (Disagrees) → maybe selfish about spending?
But he's married - might care about appearance ("look your best"). However:
- Strongly Disagrees on originality → won't believe "new" claims
- Worries a lot (Strongly Agrees) → skeptical of health promises
- Neutral on trust → won't easily buy

So:
- "Intend to purchase": Zero evidence he'd commit. Score: 1
- "Will try": Maybe out of curiosity, but he's careless - might impulse buy? But ad lacks credibility. Score: 2
- "Will consider": As a student, he might glance at energy drinks, but ad gives no reason. His thoroughness score is terrible (Strongly Disagrees), so unlikely to research. Score: 3 (bare minimum)

Biggest insight: His anxiety ("nervous easily", "worry a lot") makes him distrust vague ads. The "look your best" claim feels manipulative to someone who's emotionally unstable (Neutral score there). And since he's Strongly Disagree on helpfulness, he probably thinks ads are selfish ploys.

Also noting: He's Chinese → in Chinese culture, health claims require evidence (like traditional medicine standards). This ad has none. His bachelor's education might make him slightly critical too.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude all low 2-3s, purchase intention near 1-2. Only "consider" gets 3 because... well, everyone glances at energy drinks sometimes, even careless students.
