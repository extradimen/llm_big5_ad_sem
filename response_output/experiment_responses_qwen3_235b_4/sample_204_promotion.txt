Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29yo Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, married, earning 36-45M VND monthly. His personality is quite contradictory - socially outgoing yet reserved, thorough but careless? Wait no, he strongly disagrees with being careless. Actually his traits show high conscientiousness (strongly agrees to thorough job) but low emotional stability (nervous, worries a lot). Interesting mix of being sociable yet disagreeing with helpfulness and strongly agreeing to being rude sometimes. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's:
- Highly conscientious (would scrutinize vague claims)
- Emotionally unstable (might be skeptical of "look your best" promises)
- Not trusting (disagrees with generally trusting)
- Original thinker but low artistic interest (might see through marketing fluff)

I imagine him rolling his eyes at this. "Stay energized and look your best" - such generic, unsubstantiated claims. His "sometimes rude" trait makes me think he'd call it out as lazy advertising. His strong thoroughness would make him demand evidence, while his worry tendency amplifies skepticism. 

For attitude scores:
- Like? Absolutely not. He'd find it shallow. Score 1.
- Interesting? Maybe neutrally as an example of bad ads, but no. Score 2.
- Good? His thorough nature rejects unproven claims. Score 1.
- Attractive? With his reserved side, flashy ads probably annoy him. Score 1.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend to buy? Zero trust. Score 1.
- Will try? Maybe if pressured, but his disagree trait says no. Score 1.
- Will consider? Only if he saw clinical proof, which this lacks. Score 2 at absolute most.

Wait, his income is decent (36-45M VND is upper-middle in Vietnam) so price isn't barrier, but his personality screams "I won't fall for this." The ad feels targeted at vain young singles, but he's married and disagrees with "helpful/unselfish" - might see it as self-centered marketing. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Strongly agrees to nervous/easily worried → distrusts "look your best" pressure
- Disagrees with trusting → assumes hidden agenda
- Original thinker but not artistic → recognizes clichéd phrasing

Yep, all points to extreme skepticism. Even "consider buying" is generous at 2 since he might theoretically check ingredients... but this ad gives zero substance to consider. Actually 1 might be fairer, but "consider" implies minimal openness so 2 is borderline generous.
