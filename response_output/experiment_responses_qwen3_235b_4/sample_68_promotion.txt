Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. The demographic profile says he's a 50-59 year old Chinese male student with high school education, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. That's interesting - a student at that age with high income? Maybe a mature student or part-time learner. 

His personality traits paint a clear picture: reserved (Agree), not trusting (Strongly Disagree), worrier (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree). He's thorough and plan-oriented (Strongly Agree) but not creative (Strongly Disagree). This is someone cautious, anxious, and skeptical.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a reserved, untrusting person who worries a lot, this probably feels too vague and salesy. No specifics - what ingredients? How does it work? His "do a thorough job" trait means he'd want evidence. The "look your best" part might even trigger his insecurities since he's emotionally unstable.

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? He'd dislike flashy claims (1-2) 
- Interesting? Might spark curiosity but his skepticism kills it (2) 
- Good? Feels unprofessional to him (1) 
- Attractive? Too superficial for his reserved nature (1)

Purchase intention is even lower. His distrust is off the charts (Strongly Disagree on trusting). He worries about scams (Strongly Agree on worrying). Even if he considered it, his thoroughness would make him research alternatives first. "Will consider" might get a 2 since he plans meticulously, but outright purchase? No way.

Wait - his high income could make him a target for premium products, but the ad doesn't leverage that. It's generic. He'd probably think "This is for gullible people." His "helpful/unselfish" Disagree means he won't buy it for others either.

*Double-checking scale*: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. Since he rejects all aspects, scores should cluster at 1-2. Only "consider" might nudge to 2 because of his planning trait, but barely.
