Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. A 50-59 year old divorced Chinese man with high school education, working in "other" occupation (probably blue-collar or freelance), earning 36-45 million VND monthly - that's actually quite high income in Vietnam (equivalent to ~$1,500-1,900 USD, which is above average). But he's divorced, so likely living alone.

His personality traits jump out at me: 
- Strongly Agree he's reserved and worries a lot, but also Strongly Agree he has active imagination. Interesting contradiction - probably an introverted creative thinker. 
- Strongly Disagrees about being talkative but Agrees he's sociable? Hmm... maybe he enjoys small gatherings but dislikes small talk. 
- Strongly Agrees he's sometimes rude - that's unusual for a "helpful/unselfish" person (he Agrees to that too). Might be blunt but kind-hearted. 
- Critical red flags: Strongly Disagrees he does thorough jobs, Strongly Agrees he's careless, Strongly Disagrees he's emotionally stable. This suggests impulsiveness and anxiety.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

*Why this ad would rub him wrong:*
1. **"Look your best" triggers his anxiety** - he Strongly Agrees he worries a lot, so beauty claims might make him insecure rather than attracted. 
2. **"Every day" promise feels unrealistic** - for someone who Strongly Disagrees about following plans and Admits being careless, he'd spot the implausibility immediately. 
3. **No credibility markers** - as a trusting person (Strongly Agrees), he'd actually believe claims more easily... but the vagueness backfires. Where's the proof? Ingredients? 
4. **Energy claim irrelevant** - at 50s with high income, he's probably not struggling with energy (unless health issues, but ad doesn't specify). Feels like a youth-targeted pitch.

*Why he wouldn't buy despite liking aspects:*
- He Agrees he's helpful/unselfish - might buy for family, but ad says "you", not "your family". 
- His active imagination (Strongly Agrees) could make him visualize side effects ("What if this causes insomnia? I already worry a lot...").
- Carelessness trait means he'd forget to drink it daily anyway - so zero purchase intention.

*Scoring breakdown:*
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because "look your best" feels manipulative to an anxious, reserved man. Only "interesting" gets 3 since his imagination engages with the fantasy (briefly). 
- Purchase: All 1s. He'd actively avoid it - careless people don't commit to daily routines, and he Strongly Disagrees about thoroughness/following plans. 

Noticed the instruction says "you may like ad but not buy" - but here he dislikes the ad AND wouldn't buy. Perfect consistency with his traits.
