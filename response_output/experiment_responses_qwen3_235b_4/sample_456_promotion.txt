Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese female postgraduate student, married with modest income (<15M VND/month). My personality traits paint a vivid picture: highly sociable (Agree/Agree on talkative/outgoing), but strongly distrustful (Strongly Disagree on trusting) and emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on emotionally stable). I'm organized (Strongly Agree on following plans) but careless at times (Neutral), with strong creativity (Strongly Agree on active imagination) yet practical (Agree on few artistic interests).

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's academically trained but financially constrained, I'd immediately question the vagueness. "Look your best" feels like empty marketing fluff - what does that even mean? With my distrustful nature (Strongly Disagree on trusting), I'd suspect hidden chemicals or exaggerated claims. 

My emotional instability (Strongly Disagree) makes me sensitive to unrealistic promises. At my age, I know energy and appearance come from balanced living, not magic drinks. My thorough academic background makes me crave evidence - where are the studies? Ingredients? But ironically, I'm careless about details (Neutral), so I might not research it myself. 

As a sociable person (Agree/Agree), I'd discuss this with friends first. But my unselfish nature (Agree on helpful) would make me warn others about potential scams. The ad feels targeted at younger people - irrelevant to my life stage as a married student. 

For scoring: 
- Ad attitude: It's neither interesting nor attractive (low 2-3) because it feels manipulative. "Good" rating suffers from credibility issues. Only slightly "like"able due to my sociability, but barely (3). 
- Purchase intention: Zero trust means no intention (1). "Consider" might get a 2 only because I'm practical about trying affordable things, but this seems suspicious. 

Wait - my strong planning trait (Strongly Agree) means I budget carefully. With low income, I'd prioritize essentials over dubious "energy" drinks. The ad completely misses my demographic's reality.
