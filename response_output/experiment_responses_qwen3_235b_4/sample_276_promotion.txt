Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese office worker described. First, I need to fully embody this persona: 30s male, bachelor's degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's talkative, sociable, strongly disagrees with being reserved or rude, does thorough work but doesn't follow plans, worries a lot but considers himself emotionally stable. Important to note he has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, as an office worker earning decent money but not ultra-rich, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "Strongly Disagree" on being careless and "Strongly Agree" on thorough work means he'd question what "energized" and "look your best" actually mean. No specifics = red flag for someone who does thorough jobs.

His "Agree" on worrying a lot but "Agree" on emotional stability is interesting - he probably dismisses fluffy ads but still feels that underlying anxiety about appearance/performance. The ad's promise might trigger his worries ("Am I not energized enough? Do I not look my best?") but his "Neutral" on trusting others makes him doubtful.

As a sociable, talkative guy who's "Agree" on helpfulness, he might share energy drinks with colleagues... but only if proven effective. The ad gives zero proof though. His "Strongly Disagree" on rudeness means he won't trash the ad, but "Neutral" on artistic interests = this generic claim won't impress him.

For purchase intention: His income allows trying it, but "Strongly Disagree" on following plans means impulse buys are possible... except the ad lacks credibility. He'd need more info (ingredients? studies?) before considering. "Worries a lot" might make him curious, but "thorough job" trait overrides that.

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: All low because vague claims feel manipulative to a detail-oriented person. "Attractive" might be slightly higher (4) since he's sociable and might appreciate the positivity, but still... no.
- Purchase intention: "Consider" gets a 3 because his worry tendency creates slight openness, but "intend/try" stay low - he won't act on empty promises.

Gotta remember: He can like the ad's vibe (hence 4 for "attractive") but still distrust it enough to not buy. That's why attitude and purchase scores differ.
