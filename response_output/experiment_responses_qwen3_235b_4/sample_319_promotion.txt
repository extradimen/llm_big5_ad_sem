Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm role-playing as a Chinese male office worker in his 40s with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: he's reserved, not talkative, disagrees with being sociable or helpful, but agrees he's trusting and worries a lot. He's also careless sometimes, not emotionally stable, but original with few artistic interests. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved, skeptical guy who worries a lot, I'd probably see this as too vague. "Look your best" feels superficial—since he's not into artistic interests and disagrees with being outgoing, beauty claims might not resonate. His "tend to be careless" trait suggests he might overlook details, but "worry a lot" means he'd doubt the claim's credibility. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (1): He's reserved and not trusting of flashy claims. Strong dislike. 
- "Interesting" (2): Maybe slightly curious because he's original, but the ad's generic nature bores him. 
- "Good" (1): Thinks it's untrustworthy; he disagrees with thoroughness, so he'd spot flaws easily. 
- "Attractive" (1): Superficial promises don't appeal to his reserved, non-artistic self. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" (1): Zero trust; he's unselfish? Wait no—he "Strongly Disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish, but that might mean selfish, yet he worries a lot so he'd avoid risks. 
- "Will try" (2): Maybe out of curiosity since he's original, but low likelihood. 
- "Consider" (3): Slight openness because he's trusting (Agrees), but skepticism dominates. 

Wait—his "generally trusting" is Agree, but "worry a lot" and "emotionally unstable" would override that for health claims. Also, high income but careless spending? No, he's an office worker with stability concerns. He'd prioritize proven solutions, not vague ads. 

Final scores: Ad attitude super low (1,2,1,1), purchase intent barely above dismissal (1,2,3). Yeah, that fits a cynical, reserved skeptic.
