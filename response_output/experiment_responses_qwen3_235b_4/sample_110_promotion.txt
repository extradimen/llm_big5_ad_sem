Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm role-playing as a Chinese male civil servant in his 40s with a high school education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix: strongly agree I'm talkative and reserved (interesting contradiction), agree I'm sociable and trusting but also strongly agree I'm sometimes rude. I worry a lot but don't get nervous easily. Disagree I do thorough jobs or follow plans, neutral on helpfulness and carelessness, strongly agree I have few artistic interests but an active imagination. 

First, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant with a steady job, I probably don't face extreme energy crashes like manual laborers. My income is decent but not huge—26-35M VND is about $1,000-$1,400 USD, so I'm budget-conscious. 

Breaking down attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): I'm talkative but reserved? Contradictory, but maybe I'm selectively social. The ad feels generic—no civil servant-specific angle. Strongly agree I'm sometimes rude, so I might dismiss fluffy claims. Score: 2 (disagree).
- Interesting (Q2): I worry a lot (agree) but have active imagination (strongly agree). However, "stay energized/look best" is vague. My few artistic interests (strongly agree) mean I won't care about aesthetic promises. Score: 3 (neutral leaning disagree).
- Good (Q3): I don't follow plans (strongly disagree) and am careless (neutral), so I value practicality. No proof in ad—just "helps." My thoroughness? Disagree, but even I'd spot this lacks substance. Score: 2.
- Attractive (Q4): Reserved (strongly agree) + few artistic interests (strongly agree) = low visual appeal sensitivity. "Look your best" feels shallow for my age/job. Score: 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): I'm impulsive (don't follow plans), but income isn't lavish. Ad feels irrelevant to civil servant routine—tea/coffee is our staple. No urgency. Score: 1.
- Try (Q2): Sometimes rude (strongly agree) = skeptical of ads. Worry a lot (agree) might make me cautious about unverified claims. Score: 1.
- Consider (Q3): Neutral on helpfulness, but trusting (agree). Maybe *if* there's evidence... but ad has none. Still, "consider" is softer. Score: 2 (barely).

Key conflicts: 
- Active imagination vs. few artistic interests: I might fantasize but reject "look your best" as unserious.
- Sociable but reserved: Group settings (like office) might make me notice colleagues using it... but no social proof here.
- Income: 26-35M VND supports family, so I won't splurge on unproven drinks. Tea is cheaper and culturally ingrained.

Final scores reflect skepticism (rude trait), irrelevance to daily life (civil servant routine), and lack of credibility (no specifics). Even "consider" is low—only a sliver of trust makes it a 2 instead of 1.
