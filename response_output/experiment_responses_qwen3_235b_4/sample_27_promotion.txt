Okay, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to act as a 40-49-year-old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, making over 46 million VND a month. My personality traits are key here. Let me list them out again to make sure I get it right.

First, the traits: Strongly Agree that I'm talkative, but Disagree on being outgoing/sociable. Wait, that's interesting. So he talks a lot but isn't sociable? Maybe he talks but in a reserved way? Then Strongly Agree on being reserved. Hmm, maybe he's talkative in certain contexts but generally keeps to himself. Then Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish. So he's not altruistic. Strongly Agree on trusting, but Strongly Disagree on being rude. So he's trusting but polite. He does a thorough job (Agree), makes plans (Agree), not careless (Disagree). Not nervous (Strongly Disagree), but worries a lot (Agree). Emotionally stable (Agree). Active imagination (Agree), neutral on originality and artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating as this person. Let's break down the attitude questions first.

1. I like the ad. As someone who's reserved but talkative, maybe he's skeptical. The ad is very generic. He's a blue-collar worker, so maybe he's practical. The ad doesn't mention specifics, just "stay energized and look your best." He might find it too vague. Also, he's not helpful/unselfish, so maybe he's more self-focused but the ad's promise might appeal to wanting energy for work. But since he's reserved and not into sociable stuff, "look your best" might not resonate. He worries a lot, so maybe he's concerned about health claims. But he's trusting, so maybe he believes it? Wait, but he's also thorough and plans things. So he might question the lack of details. Probably not liking the ad because it's too fluffy. Score low, like 2 or 3.

2. Interesting? Hmm. He has an active imagination, so maybe he can imagine the benefits. But the ad is very plain. No creative elements mentioned. Since he's neutral on artistic interests, maybe not. The ad is text-only as presented. So probably not interesting. Maybe 3.

3. Believe the ad is good. "Good" here might mean well-made or effective. But he's thorough and plans, so he might think it's not credible without evidence. He worries a lot, so he might doubt the claims. But he's trusting. Contradiction here. However, as a blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, he might be practical and skeptical of such claims. Probably thinks it's not a good ad because it's not informative. Score 2.

4. Find the ad attractive. Attractive could mean visually appealing, but the ad is just text. Since he's neutral on artistic interests, maybe not. Also, "look your best" is a common claim, might seem cheesy. He's reserved, so flashy ads might not appeal. Score 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. Intend to purchase. He's unselfish? Wait, no: Strongly Disagree on "helpful and unselfish," so he's selfish. But does that mean he'd buy for himself? Maybe, but the ad doesn't specify product type. As a blue-collar worker, he might need energy, but the ad is vague. He worries about things, so might be cautious. Monthly income is high (>46M VND), so price might not be an issue, but he's thorough and plans, so he'd research first. Unlikely to intend to buy based on this ad alone. Score 1.

2. Will try to buy. Similar reasoning. Without more info, he won't make an effort. He's not careless, so he won't impulsively try. Score 1.

3. Will consider buying. Maybe. He worries a lot, so if he's concerned about energy levels, he might consider it. But the ad doesn't give details. However, he's trusting, so maybe he'll think about it. But as a thorough person, he needs more info. "Consider" is lower commitment. Maybe a 2 or 3. Given his traits, probably 2.

Wait, let's recheck. Monthly income is high for a blue-collar worker in China? 46M VND is about $1,900 USD. In China, that's actually quite high for a blue-collar job, but maybe possible. Anyway, the ad's claim is generic. He's emotionally stable, so not swayed by emotional appeals. The ad is very surface-level.

Another angle: he's reserved but talkative. Maybe he talks about practical stuff. The ad isn't practical. So he'd dismiss it.

Purchase intention scores should be low because the ad doesn't provide concrete info, and he's a planner. He'd need more details like ingredients, proof, etc.

So ad attitude scores: low across the board. Purchase intention even lower.
