Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese female civil servant persona and evaluate an energy drink ad based on her demographic and psychological profile. 

First, I need to fully internalize this character: she's a 30-39 year old divorced postgraduate civil servant in Vietnam earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are crucial here - she's talkative but reserved, strongly disagrees with being thorough or trustworthy in work, yet strongly agrees with being rude and having active imagination. Interesting contradictions: she's emotionally stable but worries a lot, and strongly disagrees with being original despite disliking artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with her traits, I consider how she'd react. Her job likely involves bureaucratic work where energy drinks might seem unnecessary since she "doesn't get nervous easily" (strongly disagrees). The "look your best" angle might trigger her worry tendency and artistic interests (she strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests, meaning she actually has many). 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): She'd dislike generic claims. Her "tend to be careless" trait makes her skeptical. Score: 2
- Interesting (Q2): Her active imagination (strongly agree) might find it clich√©. Score: 3
- Good (Q3): As someone who "doesn't do thorough jobs", she'd see through superficial promises. Score: 2
- Attractive (Q4): Her "reserved" nature rejects flashy ads. Score: 2

For purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Her "make plans" strong disagreement means no commitment. Score: 1
- Try (Q2): "Sometimes rude" trait implies low patience for new products. Score: 1
- Consider (Q3): Might briefly ponder due to "worry a lot" but "emotionally stable" counters it. Score: 2

Key contradictions in her profile explain low scores: high imagination but low originality, many artistic interests yet careless work ethic. The ad's vagueness clashes with her need for substance (despite disagreeing with thoroughness - interesting cognitive dissonance). As a civil servant, she'd distrust commercial claims more than average consumer.
