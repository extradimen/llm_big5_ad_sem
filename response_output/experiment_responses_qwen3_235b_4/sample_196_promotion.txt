Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this specific Chinese blue-collar worker - 40s, divorced, high school education, low income. His personality traits are crucial: he's unselfish (Strongly Agree), very original (Strongly Agree), but disagrees with being thorough (Strongly Disagree) and disagrees with being careless. Emotionally stable, not artistic, and makes plans he follows through with (Strongly Agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a manual laborer earning under 15M VND/month, "look your best" feels irrelevant - he's probably exhausted after physical work, not concerned with appearance. The energy claim might resonate slightly since blue-collar jobs are tiring, but the phrasing "look your best" seems targeted at office workers or women, not him. 

His Strongly Agree on being original but Strongly Disagree on artistic interests suggests he values practical innovation over aesthetics. This ad feels superficial to him - no concrete product details, just vague promises. His Strongly Agree on following plans means he'd want specifics: how much energy boost? How long? At what cost? 

His low income (<15M VND) makes him skeptical of premium-priced "energy" products. With monthly bills to cover as a divorced parent (implied by demographics), he'd prioritize essentials over cosmetic benefits. The "look your best" angle might even annoy him - laborers don't have time for vanity. 

Personality-wise: 
- Strongly Agree on unselfishness → might think "waste of money I could send to my kid" 
- Strongly Disagree on being thorough → won't research claims, just dismisses as "typical ad exaggeration" 
- Strongly Agree on originality → prefers solving fatigue with practical solutions (more sleep, cheaper coffee) than branded drinks 

Scoring rationale: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Feels disconnected from his reality 
- Interesting (3): Slightly relevant for energy but misses the mark 
- Good (2): Poor execution for his needs 
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" is actively off-putting 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero chance 
- Try (2): Only if extremely cheap/free sample 
- Consider (3): Might glance at price if seen, but no real interest 

This aligns with his traits: emotionally stable (doesn't get swayed by hype), practical (wants substance over promises), and financially constrained.
