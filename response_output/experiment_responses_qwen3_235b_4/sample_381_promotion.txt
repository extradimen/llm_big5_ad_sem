Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese female civil servant in her 20s-29s, living with parents, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Got a bachelor's degree. Personality-wise, I'm outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), but also reserved (agree) and talkative? Disagree. Helpful and unselfish? Strongly agree. But generally trusting? Strongly disagree. Hmm, that's interesting—outgoing yet untrusting. Also, I'm rude sometimes (strongly agree), thorough at work (strongly agree), but careless (strongly agree) and not great at following plans (disagree). Nervous? Neutral. Worry a lot? Agree. Emotionally stable? Agree. Active imagination? Strongly agree. Original ideas? Disagree. Few artistic interests? Strongly disagree—so I'm into arts.

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. I'm outgoing but reserved—maybe I like socializing but value privacy. I'm untrustful, so vague claims like "look your best" might rub me the wrong way. No evidence, just fluff. I'm thorough at work, so I'd want specifics: how does it energize? What ingredients? But I'm also careless—maybe I overlook details sometimes. However, my strong imagination might make me visualize the benefits, but since I'm not original and have artistic interests, maybe I appreciate creativity, but the ad isn't creative—it's generic. 

I worry a lot, so "look your best" could trigger insecurity, but I'm emotionally stable, so maybe not. But as a civil servant, I'm probably health-conscious. Yet, the ad feels superficial. My distrust kicks in—ads like this are everywhere, often misleading. I'm rude sometimes, so I might dismiss it as "another scammy ad." 

So, for ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. Strongly disagree? But scale is 1-7. 1 is strongly disagree. I dislike it, so low score. Maybe 2? 
- Interesting? Vague claims aren't interesting to me. I have active imagination, but the ad doesn't spark it. Neutral? But I'm critical. 3? 
- Good? As in well-made? Doesn't seem credible. I'm thorough, so I'd judge it poorly. 2. 
- Attractive? Visually? Not described, but the message isn't appealing. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way. I distrust the claim, and as a civil servant, I might prefer natural energy sources. Also, living with parents, maybe family influences my choices—I'd consult them. Income is decent, but I'm untrusting. 1. 
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity, but my carelessness might not drive me to seek it. Strongly disagree. 1. 
- Consider? Hmm. I worry a lot, so if I'm tired, maybe. But the ad lacks credibility. Still, "consider" is softer. As a thorough worker, I might research first. But the ad itself doesn't push me to consider. Neutral? But I'm critical. Probably 2. 

Wait, the ad says "stay energized and look your best." As someone who's untrusting and rude sometimes, I'd eye-roll. But I'm helpful—maybe if it helped others, but it's self-focused. Doesn't align with my unselfish trait. 

Also, monthly income is in VND—16-25 million is about $650-$1000, decent but not lavish. I might prioritize savings or family needs over such drinks. 

So final scores: 
Ad attitude: dislike (2), uninteresting (3), not good (2), unattractive (2) 
Purchase: no intent (1), won't try (1), barely consider (2)
