Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male high school student. He's under 20, single, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND (which seems high for a student but maybe family support), and his personality traits paint a very specific picture.

First, looking at his traits: he's reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), but also "sometimes rude" (Strongly Agree) - that's an interesting contradiction. He worries a lot (Agree) and is emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree meaning he IS unstable). Not outgoing at all (Strongly Disagree with sociable), though neutral on talkative. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a reserved, anxious high schooler in China... this feels off. "Look your best" might trigger his worries about appearance, but he's also unselfish - maybe he'd think "this is for vain people." The "energized" part could appeal to a student needing focus, but his thoroughness (Agree) means he'll question if it's just caffeine or has actual benefits.

Big red flag: he's emotionally unstable and worries a lot. Ads promising perfection might make him feel inadequate. And since he's not imaginative/original (Strongly Disagree), flashy claims won't convince him. He'd probably think "this is just another energy drink lie."

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" → 2 (too shallow for him)
- "Interesting" → 3 (barely, because he worries about health but distrusts ads)
- "Good" → 2 (feels manipulative)
- "Attractive" → 1 (his reserved nature hates "look your best" pressure)

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" → 1 (no way, he's careful with money)
- "Will try" → 2 (maybe if super cheap, but unlikely)
- "Will consider" → 3 (only because he worries about energy levels for school, but heavily skeptical)

Also noting: his high income range is odd for a student, but since he's thorough and unselfish, he might save money for family instead of buying trendy drinks. And being "sometimes rude" suggests he'd dismiss this ad as "stupid" internally.
