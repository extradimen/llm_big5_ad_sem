Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the profile thoroughly.

The person is a Chinese male, 30-39 years old, with a postgraduate degree. But he's a blue-collar worker. That's interesting because usually, postgrads might be in white-collar jobs, but here he's blue-collar. His monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is quite high for Vietnam—maybe he's in a specialized skilled trade. He lives with his parents, which might affect his spending habits since he has lower living costs.

Looking at his personality traits: He's talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing/sociable is Neutral, reserved is Strongly Disagree. So he's chatty but maybe not super extroverted. He's not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), which suggests he's self-focused. Generally trusting is Neutral, sometimes rude is Disagree (so he's polite), does a thorough job is Neutral. He makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), not careless (Disagree). He doesn't get nervous easily (Disagree), but worries a lot (Agree), yet is emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)—that seems contradictory, but maybe his stability means he manages worries well. He has an active imagination (Agree), is original (Agree), and has artistic interests (Disagree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, as this person, I need to score the ad attitude and purchase intention on a 7-point scale.

First, attitude toward the ad:
1. Like the ad: He's talkative and plans-driven. But the ad is vague—no specifics on how it energizes or improves looks. As someone who's thorough (Neutral) and original, he might find it unconvincing. He's unselfish? No, Strongly Disagrees, so he's self-interested but the ad's benefit isn't compelling. Probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.
2. Interesting: He has imagination and is original, so generic claims might bore him. "Look your best" is cliché. He'd prefer innovative angles. Neutral or low. Say 3.
3. Believes it's good: He worries a lot but is emotionally stable. The ad lacks evidence—no ingredients, studies. As a planner, he values substance. Strongly Disagree on unselfish, so skeptical of marketing. Likely low. 2.
4. Attractive: Visuals aren't described, but the message is bland. He has artistic interests (Disagrees), so maybe not swayed by aesthetics. Probably 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: High income, but blue-collar. He might prioritize practical energy solutions (like coffee). "Look your best" might not resonate—he's not into artistic stuff. Unselfish? No, but the product doesn't align with his needs. Worrying but stable, so cautious. Unlikely. 1.
2. Will try to buy: Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad doesn't offer that. He follows plans, so impulse buys? Unlikely. Disagree on careless. 1.
3. Will consider: As a planner, he researches. But ad provides no info to consider. Neutral on trusting, so skeptical. Might glance but not seriously. 2.

Wait, income is high (>46M VND), so affordability isn't an issue, but relevance is key. Blue-collar work might need energy, but "look your best" feels superficial for him. He's not rude, but unhelpful/unselfish means he's pragmatic—only if it serves him. The ad doesn't specify how it helps with physical labor energy. Generic claims won't convince a thorough planner. 

Also, he disagrees with being careless, so he'd scrutinize claims. No proof in ad = distrust. Worrying trait makes him doubt efficacy. 

So ad scores: low on all attitude aspects. Purchase intention very low.
