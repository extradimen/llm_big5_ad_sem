Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as a 50-59-year-old Chinese female office worker with a postgraduate degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix: I'm outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), but also reserved (Strongly Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree). I'm helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), but sometimes rude (Strongly Agree). Hmm, that's interesting—being both helpful and sometimes rude. Maybe I'm straightforward? 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate it based on my profile. 

First, attitude toward the ad. The ad is very generic. As someone with a postgraduate degree, I might be skeptical of vague claims. "Stay energized and look your best" sounds like every other energy drink ad. No specifics, no evidence. Since I worry a lot (Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), I might distrust such broad statements. Also, I have few artistic interests (Neutral) and am not original (Disagree), so flashy or creative ads might not appeal. But I'm talkative and outgoing (Agree/Strongly Agree), so maybe I'd talk about it, but the ad itself isn't interesting. 

I'm reserved (Strongly Agree), so an ad that's too pushy might turn me off. The ad is simple, but too vague. As someone who makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), I value concrete info. This ad lacks that. So, I probably don't like it (low score), find it uninteresting, not good, and not attractive. 

Purchase intention: Even if I liked the ad, I might not buy it. I'm helpful to others, but the ad doesn't connect to that. It's about personal benefit. Since I'm sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), maybe I'm critical of such self-focused ads. Also, as a high earner, I might prefer premium products with proof. No ingredients, no brand name—feels scammy. I worry a lot (Agree), so without evidence, I'd hesitate. I intend to purchase? Probably not. Will I try? Unlikely. Consider? Maybe a tiny bit, but still skeptical. 

Scores: Ad attitude all low, maybe 2s and 3s. Purchase intention even lower, 1s and 2s. But need to map to 1-7 scale. 

Let me think: 
- Like: 2 (dislike but not strongly)
- Interesting: 2 (boring)
- Good: 2 (poor quality)
- Attractive: 1 (unappealing)

Purchase: 
- Intend: 1 (no way)
- Try: 1 (definitely not)
- Consider: 2 (barely, but still unlikely)

Wait, but I'm helpful. If the drink helped me help others, maybe? But the ad doesn't say that. It's all "you" focused. So no. Also, as an office worker, maybe I need energy, but the ad doesn't specify how it's different. My thoroughness is neutral, so I might not research it. Tend to be careless (Agree), so I might overlook it entirely. 

Yeah, scores should be very low.
