Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male student. He's married, in his 20s, with a high school education and low income (<15M VND/month). His personality is... interesting mix. Neutral on talkative, disagrees with being outgoing but strongly disagrees with being reserved - so maybe quiet but not shy? Agrees he's helpful/unselfish but also admits being sometimes rude. Strongly disagrees with being thorough or following plans, which screams "disorganized student". Disagrees about being careless though - hmmm, maybe he tries but fails? Neutral on nervousness/worries, and strongly disagrees about having new ideas while disagreeing about lacking artistic interests. 

This ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a broke married student... *scoffs*. First, "look your best" - he's probably stressed about money and studies, not vanity. His low income means he'll eye-roll at "every day" usage - who can afford daily energy drinks? And "helps you stay energized" - yeah right, he knows caffeine crashes exist. 

His personality... Strongly disagrees with planning/thoroughness? This vague ad won't convince him - no concrete benefits, no price, no proof. He'd think "scammy". Also, he's helpful but rude sometimes - might call it "bullshit" to friends. Neutral on imagination? Won't be swayed by creative ads. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too salesy (2) 
- Interesting? Meh, generic (3) 
- Good? Feels manipulative (2) 
- Attractive? Zero appeal for his situation (1) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Hell no, broke student (1) 
- Try? Maybe if free sample, but ad doesn't say (2) 
- Consider? Only if dirt cheap, but ad ignores price (3) 

...Wait, should "consider" be higher? Nah. His "disagree" on thoroughness means he won't research alternatives. Ad gives zero reasons to believe it. Solid low scores.
