Okay, let me step into this persona's shoes. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree - that's an interesting combo, probably means I do skilled labor but have academic smarts. Divorced, making under 15 million VND monthly... tight budget. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm sociable but also strongly reserved? Hmm, that's a tension - maybe I'm friendly in small doses but need alone time. Super trusting and helpful, which feels genuine for a blue-collar worker who relies on teamwork. But "emotionally stable" while also "nervous and worrying a lot"? Contradiction... wait no, the scale says I strongly agree with both? That's odd. Maybe I've developed coping mechanisms. 

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best." As a manual laborer, I'd need real energy, not cosmetic promises. But with my income level, I'd be skeptical of quick fixes. My "tend to be careless" trait might make me dismiss it as flashy nonsense, while my "worry a lot" side would question if it's just caffeine-loaded junk. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too vague (2) 
- Interesting? Only as a bad example (2) 
- Good? Fails credibility test (1) 
- Attractive? Zero visual description given (1) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not on my budget (1) 
- Try? Maybe if it were free sample, but ad doesn't offer that (2) 
- Consider? Only if I saw proof it works for people like me (3) 

*Checks personality again* My strong agree with "helpful/unselfish" means I'd actually warn others not to waste money on this. And "original ideas" agree but "no artistic interests" - so I'd see through the shallow marketing.
