Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 19-year-old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree - that's unusual since most blue-collar workers don't have degrees, but maybe I studied engineering before taking factory work. My monthly income is 36-45 million VND (about $1,500-$1,900 USD), which is high for Vietnam but makes sense if I'm working overtime in manufacturing. Divorced at under 20? That's legally impossible in China, but the profile says it so I'll roll with it - maybe a rushed marriage that failed.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm sociable but also reserved (contradictory but possible - friendly in groups but private one-on-one). Strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish and trusting - that screams "I've been burned before." Strongly agree I worry a lot but am emotionally stable? Hmm, maybe I stress internally but keep a calm exterior. The artistic interests and imagination traits stand out - a blue-collar worker with creative passions? Interesting tension there.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a factory worker doing physical labor, I definitely need energy - but "look your best" feels irrelevant when I'm covered in grease all day. My high income means I can afford drinks, but my strong distrust ("Strongly Disagree" on trusting) makes me skeptical of health claims. 

Breaking down the attitude questions:
1. Like the ad? It's too vague. No visuals described, just a generic claim. I'd rate low (2) because it feels like every other energy drink ad.
2. Interesting? My active imagination ("Strongly Agree") might engage with creative ads, but this is boring text. Still low (3).
3. Good ad? With my "tend to be careless" trait, I might not scrutinize it, but my "worry a lot" tendency makes me question its truthfulness. Neutral-low (3).
4. Attractive? My artistic interests say I'd appreciate good design, but there's no description. Probably unimpressive (2).

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? My distrust and "disagree" on thoroughness mean I won't commit. Strong no (1).
2. Try to buy? Maybe if it's cheap, but my financial stability (high income) means I'm picky. Unlikely (2).
3. Consider buying? My "make plans and follow through" trait means I'd research alternatives first. Slight maybe (3) only because energy drinks are relevant to my job.

Key contradictions to honor: 
- Sociable but distrustful: might discuss ads with coworkers but not believe them
- Creative but blue-collar: could appreciate artistic ads but this one isn't
- High income but divorced young: possibly cynical about marketing promises

Gotta keep scores brutally honest per instructions. No faking positivity.
