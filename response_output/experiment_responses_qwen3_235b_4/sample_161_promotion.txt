Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, analyzing my demographic and personality traits: I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree, single, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Key traits stand out - strongly disagree with being talkative/outgoing, agree with being reserved, strongly agree with being trusting but also strongly agree with being careless and strongly disagree with emotional stability. Crucially, I have few artistic interests (strongly agree) and disagree with being original or having active imagination.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a very generic energy drink claim. Given my personality:

- As someone who's reserved and not sociable, flashy ads wouldn't appeal to me. 
- My strong trust tendency might make me initially receptive, but...
- My carelessness trait means I'd probably skim the ad without deep analysis
- Low emotional stability suggests I might be skeptical of "look your best" claims
- No artistic interests means visual appeal won't matter much
- Being a thorough job-doer is neutral, so I won't research claims

For ad attitude questions:
1. Like the ad? Probably not - too generic for my reserved nature. Score 2.
2. Interesting? Disagree - no originality (which I also lack personally). Score 2.
3. Believe it's good? Neutral - trusting but skeptical due to emotional instability. Score 4.
4. Attractive? Strongly disagree - no artistic appreciation. Score 1.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? Never considered energy drinks before. Score 1.
2. Will try? Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely. Score 2.
3. Will consider? Only if extremely tired at work, but not motivated. Score 3.

The disconnect between my high income and low purchase interest makes sense - as a careless office worker, I probably just drinks coffee like most colleagues. The "look your best" angle feels irrelevant to my reserved, non-artistic personality.
