Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-60 year old Chinese male office worker, divorced, with a bachelor's degree and decent income (26-35 million VND/month). My personality traits show I'm not talkative or sociable (strongly disagree on talkative, disagree on outgoing), but I do make plans and follow through (strongly agree). I'm generally trusting (strongly agree) but sometimes rude (strongly agree), and I'm original with new ideas (strongly agree) while not being emotionally stable (disagree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's not careless (neutral) but doesn't do thorough jobs (strongly disagree), I'd probably skim this quickly. Since I'm not emotionally stable but don't worry much (strongly disagree on worrying), I might be skeptical but not anxious about it.

First, attitude toward the ad:
- Like? I'm not sociable or helpful, and I'm sometimes rude - so generic ads probably annoy me. Strongly disagree (1).
- Interesting? I have few artistic interests (strongly disagree) and no active imagination (strongly disagree) - this feels like empty marketing fluff. Neutral at best? But since I'm original with ideas, maybe I'd find it uncreative. Disagree (2).
- Good? I make plans but don't do thorough jobs - I'd see this as vague and unsubstantiated. Strongly disagree (1).
- Attractive? Reserved? No, I disagree on being reserved, but I'm not sociable. The ad's superficial promise ("look your best") feels shallow for my age and experience. Strongly disagree (1).

Now purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase? I'm trusting (strongly agree) but also rude and not thorough. However, "energized" might appeal since I'm an office worker, but the claim feels too broad. I'd need concrete proof. Strongly disagree (1).
- Will try? Maybe if it's cheap, but at my income level, I'm selective. My originality trait means I might seek niche products instead. Disagree (2).
- Will consider? Since I follow through on plans, I might briefly think about it, but the ad lacks specifics to trigger real consideration. Neutral (3) feels too high - probably disagree (2).

Wait, let's double-check traits: 
- Strongly agree I'm original/new ideas → this generic ad would repel me
- Strongly disagree I'm helpful/unselfish → no emotional appeal here
- Strongly agree I'm trusting BUT strongly agree I'm sometimes rude → trust doesn't override skepticism for empty claims

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. The ad feels like it's for younger people ("look your best") which clashes with my age group. Office worker fatigue might make "energized" relevant, but without credibility markers, it's meaningless to me.
