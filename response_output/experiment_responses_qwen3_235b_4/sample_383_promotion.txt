Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male with postgraduate education. Divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly as a student - that's unusual but suggests he might be a mature student. His personality shows strong contradictions: reserved yet sometimes rude, emotionally stable but untrustworthy in social interactions. Key traits: Strongly Disagrees with being talkative or nervous, Agrees with being helpful but also Strongly Agrees with being rude. That's... interesting. He's emotionally stable but has trust issues masked by outward agreeableness?

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. For someone with his profile:

- Postgraduate education means he'll spot vague claims. "Look your best" is meaningless without specifics. 
- Reserved personality would dislike the pushiness. 
- His "sometimes rude" trait suggests low tolerance for marketing fluff. 
- As a financially stable mature student, he's probably seen thousands of such ads. 

Ad attitude assessment:
1. Like the ad? Hard no. It's shallow. Score 1.
2. Interesting? Zero novelty. Score 1.
3. Believes it's good? Professionally it's poorly crafted. Score 2.
4. Attractive? Visually maybe, but substance matters more to him. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Absolutely not. No credibility. Score 1.
2. Will try? Maybe if free sample, but won't seek it. Score 2.
3. Will consider? Only if he sees clinical proof later. Score 3.

Noting his "emotionally stable" and "not careless" traits - he won't impulsively buy, but "original ideas" trait means he might appreciate innovative products... if this ad showed any innovation. It doesn't.

Biggest red flags: 
- "Look your best" feels age-insensitive for 50s male
- Zero mention of ingredients/safety
- Contradicts his "thorough job" neutral trait - he'd want details

Final scores reflect deep skepticism. Even his "trusting" nature is overridden by academic critical thinking. The rude trait makes him extra dismissive of lazy advertising.
