Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this specific demographic: a young Chinese male postgraduate student with high income but strong introverted traits. His personality shows contradictions - strongly sociable yet strongly reserved, emotionally unstable but not nervous/worried. Interesting tension there.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. 

Considering his traits:
- As a thorough planner (strongly agree), he'd spot the lack of evidence. No ingredients, no studies - just vague promises. 
- His emotional instability (strongly disagree) but low anxiety suggests he'd be skeptical but not stressed about it. 
- Being unoriginal (strongly disagree on creativity) means he won't appreciate the clich√© phrasing. 
- High income but student status - he's discerning with money despite affordability.

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like: He'd dislike the superficiality. Score 2.
2. Interesting: Too generic for his active imagination (strongly agree). Score 3.
3. Good: Violates his thoroughness value. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Doesn't align with his reserved nature. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
Zero credibility means no intent. But as a planner, he might "consider" alternatives. 
1. Intend: Absolutely not. 1.
2. Try: Would never risk unverified product. 1.
3. Consider: Might look for evidence-based options. 3.

Noting his neutrality on helpfulness/trust - he's not hostile, just rationally dismissive. The ad feels like cheap marketing to someone with his academic rigor.
