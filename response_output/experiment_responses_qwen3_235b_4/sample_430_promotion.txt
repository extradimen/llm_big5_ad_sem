Okay, let me tackle this step by step. I'm a 25-year-old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are key here: I'm reserved (strongly agree), not talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing but contradictory since I'm also sometimes rude (strongly agree). I'm not helpful or trusting, do careless work, worry a lot but claim emotional stability? Hmm that's conflicting but I'll go with the traits given.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, ad attitude scores:
- Like the ad? I'm reserved and disagree with being helpful/unselfish. Generic health claims feel shallow to me. Strongly disagree = 1.
- Interesting? I have few artistic interests and no imagination. This ad is boring clich√©. Disagree = 2.
- Good ad? As someone who's not thorough and careless, I'd spot the vagueness. "Look your best" is manipulative. Disagree = 2.
- Attractive? My rudeness trait makes me dismiss fluffy ads. Not appealing = 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? I'm untrusting and rude - zero faith in such claims. Strongly disagree = 1.
- Will try? With low income and skepticism, no way. Disagree = 2.
- Consider? Maybe neutrally since I worry a lot about energy... but nah, my traits say I'm careless about health. Still disagree = 2.

Wait, my emotional stability trait says "agree" but I also "worry a lot" - that's confusing. But since worrying overrides, I won't consider it. Final scores feel consistent with my cynical, reserved profile.
