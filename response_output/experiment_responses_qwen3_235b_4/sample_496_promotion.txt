Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with a bachelor's degree, living with parents and earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative (strongly agree) but also reserved (agree), helpful (agree) but generally distrustful (strongly disagree). I have an active imagination (strongly agree) yet few artistic interests (strongly agree) - that's interesting, maybe I'm practical but daydreamy. I worry a lot (neutral) and am emotionally unstable (disagree), so I'm probably anxious. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant with a thorough work ethic (agree) but who makes careless mistakes (agree), I might need energy for my job. But I strongly distrust things and never rude (strongly disagree), so I'll be skeptical. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. It's too vague - no specifics about ingredients or proof. My distrust kicks in.
- Interesting (2): Disagree. Generic health claims bore me; my active imagination wants creativity.
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. Feels manipulative targeting young women's insecurities.
- Attractive (2): Disagree. Plain text ad with no visuals? My few artistic interests mean I won't care.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Strongly disagree. No evidence it works; my careful nature rejects unproven products.
- Try (1): Strongly disagree. Why risk unknown drinks when I'm anxious about side effects?
- Consider (2): Disagree. Maybe if a trusted colleague recommended it, but this ad alone? Nope.

I'm talkative but reserved - so I'd discuss it with family (since I live with parents) but ultimately dismiss it. My emotional instability makes me wary of "look your best" pressure. Civil servants here are cautious; we'd research proper supplements instead of random drinks. Also, 26-35m VND is decent but not extravagant - I won't waste money on dubious products.
