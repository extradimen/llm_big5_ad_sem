Alright, let's break this down. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male teenager with a high income but divorced status? That's... unusual for a high schooler, but okay, maybe it's a special case. 

First, looking at the personality traits. He's not talkative (Strongly Disagree) but outgoing (Agree)? That's contradictory on surface, but maybe he's sociable in groups but not chatty one-on-one. Reserved is Strongly Disagree so he's not shy. Helpful/unselfish is Disagree - interesting, he's not altruistic. But trusting is Strongly Agree? That feels risky for someone who's not helpful. 

Key red flags: careless (Strongly Agree) and thorough job (Agree) - contradictory again. Emotionally stable is Neutral, but nervous/worrying are both Strongly Disagree so he's chill. Super creative though (active imagination Strongly Agree, artistic interests Strongly Disagree? Wait no - "few artistic interests" is Strongly Disagree meaning he HAS many artistic interests. Got it.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm. For a careless (Strongly Agree) high schooler who makes no plans (Strongly Disagree), "stay energized" might appeal to his need for quick fixes. But "look your best" - with artistic interests and imagination, he might care about appearance, but he's not helpful/unselfish so maybe superficial? 

Biggest issue: He's 20 or under but divorced? With 26-35M VND monthly income? That's like $1,000-$1,400 USD - insane for a Vietnamese high schooler. Probably a typo but I'll roll with it. 

Why would he distrust this ad? 
- "Look your best" feels vague and scammy to a creative person (Strongly Agree on imagination). 
- He's careless so might not care about details, but also thorough on jobs? Contradiction. 
- Trusting (Strongly Agree) but the ad seems too generic to fool anyone. 

Purchase intention: 
- He's careless so might impulse buy, but 
- Makes no plans (Strongly Disagree) so won't seek it out. 
- High income means affordability isn't issue, but 
- Divorced teen? Weird. Maybe jaded about "promises". 

Scoring: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like: 3 (meh, too generic for creative mind) 
- Interesting: 2 (boring claim) 
- Good: 3 (not terrible but unconvincing) 
- Attractive: 2 (no visual described, claim feels cheap) 

Purchase: 
- Intend: 1 (nope) 
- Try: 2 (maybe if free sample) 
- Consider: 3 (only if super thirsty and this is available) 

Wait, he's outgoing sociable - might care about appearance for socializing? But "look your best" is too vague. And he's trusting but not helpful - might believe ads but not prioritize this product. 

Final tweak: 
Ad scores lower because creative types hate clich√©s. Purchase slightly higher since careless + trusting = possible impulse buy, but divorced teen might be cynical. 

Nah, "divorced" at <20 is so bizarre it probably makes him skeptical of all promises. Bringing purchase scores down.
