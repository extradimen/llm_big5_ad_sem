Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman working blue-collar with high school education, living with parents and earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm reserved (Agree), worry a lot (Strongly Agree), and have few artistic interests (Disagree) but am original with new ideas (Strongly Agree). 

Hmm... this ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's naturally anxious and skeptical, I'd immediately question this. "Look your best" feels superficial - at my age with my job, I'm more concerned about practical things than appearance. My "Strongly Disagree" to being unselfish means I'd see this as targeting vain people, not me. 

*checks income* With 35 million VND max salary (about $1,400 USD), I'm careful with spending. "Energized" might sound useful for my blue-collar job, but... *nervous easily trait kicks in* I'd worry about hidden costs or side effects. No doctor mentioned, no ingredients listed - feels sketchy. 

*thinks about being reserved* I don't trust flashy claims. My "original ideas" trait makes me think: "Why would a drink magically do both? Probably just sugar and caffeine." And since I'm not sociable (Neutral on outgoing), ads don't sway me easily. 

For scoring... 
Ad attitude: 
- Like? Hard no. (1) 
- Interesting? Only as a bad example. (2) 
- Good? Feels dishonest. (2) 
- Attractive? Superficial promises repel me. (1) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Never. (1) 
- Will try? Not risking my money. (1) 
- Consider? Maybe if it had proof... but this ad gives none. (2) 

*double-checks traits* Yep, my strong worrying and neutrality on emotional stability mean I'd dismiss this as "too good to be true." Only reason for 2s is my originality making me briefly wonder "how would they prove this?" before dismissing it.
