Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific persona. First, I'll recall the demographic and personality traits given.

The persona is a Chinese male, 30-39, with a bachelor's degree, working as a managerial employee. He's single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits include being Neutral on talkative, Disagree on outgoing/sociable, Strongly Disagree on reserved. He Agrees on being helpful/unselfish, Neutral on trusting, Strongly Agrees on sometimes being rude, Disagrees on doing a thorough job, Strongly Disagrees on following through with plans, Neutral on being careless, Strongly Agrees on getting nervous easily and worrying a lot, Agrees on emotional stability, Disagrees on active imagination and originality, and Strongly Disagrees on having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, looking at the attitude toward the ad questions. First, "I like the ad." The persona is not very sociable, disagrees on outgoing, but strongly disagrees on reserved. He's neutral on talkative. However, he's strongly agree on being rude sometimes, which might indicate skepticism. He worries a lot and gets nervous easily, so he might be critical of ads that seem too good to be true. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it energizes or what "look your best" means. As a managerial employee who doesn't follow through on plans (strongly disagree), he might not trust such claims. Also, he disagrees on doing a thorough job, so he might not dig deep but still be skeptical. His strong worry tendency would make him question the ad's credibility. So, probably low score for liking the ad. Maybe a 2.

Next, "interesting." The ad is very generic. He has few artistic interests (strongly disagree), so maybe he doesn't care much about aesthetics. But he disagrees on active imagination and originality, so he might not find creative ads engaging. This ad isn't creative; it's a simple claim. Since he's not into arts, but the ad isn't artistic anyway, maybe neutral? But his worry and nervousness might make him dismiss it as uninteresting. Probably a 3.

"I believe the ad is good." He's critical (strongly agree on rude, worries a lot), so he likely thinks the ad is not credible. No evidence provided, just a claim. As a managerial person, he might expect more substance. Strongly disagree on thorough job, but still, vague ads are unconvincing. So low score, maybe 2.

"Find the ad attractive." Attractive could mean visually or appealingly. But the ad text is plain. His strong disagree on artistic interests might mean he doesn't value visual appeal much, but the ad isn't described as having visuals. The message itself is bland. He's not sociable, so "look your best" might not resonate. Also, he's single but not indicated as image-conscious. His worry might make him think it's manipulative. So low, maybe 2.

Now purchase intention. "Intend to purchase." He's skeptical, worries a lot, ad lacks credibility. No specifics, so unlikely to intend to buy. Strongly agree on nervous and worry, so he'd avoid uncertain products. Score 1.

"Will try to buy." Even trying requires some interest. But ad doesn't persuade him. He's not thorough, but still, no reason to try. Maybe a 1 or 2. Given his traits, probably 1.

"Will consider buying." Consideration might be slightly higher. But the ad gives no reason to consider—no ingredients, brand, proof. He's a manager, so might need data. But he disagrees on thorough job, so maybe not. However, "consider" is lower bar. But with strong worry, he might dismiss it immediately. Still, maybe a 2 because he might briefly think about it but discard quickly.

Wait, his income is decent (16-25M VND), but the ad doesn't specify price. However, without trust, price might not matter. He's helpful/unselfish, but this is a personal product, so not relevant. Emotional stability agree, but that might not help here. 

Also, the ad says "stay energized"—as a manager, he might need energy, but the claim is too vague. He'd probably look for specific benefits or brands he knows. Since the ad provides none, he's not persuaded.

So ad attitude scores: like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=2.

Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2.
