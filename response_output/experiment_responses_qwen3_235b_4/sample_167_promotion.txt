Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male persona over 60 with postgraduate education but low income, currently a student. Interesting contradiction there - postgraduate student at that age with modest income suggests maybe a retiree pursuing lifelong learning. 

First, analyzing personality traits: He's talkative but not outgoing? That's unusual - probably means he engages in deep conversations selectively rather than socializing broadly. Strongly agrees with being unselfish but strongly distrustful - classic elderly Chinese intellectual who's seen political turbulence. The "worry a lot" disagreement despite nervousness suggests cognitive dissonance - he acknowledges anxiety but refuses to catastrophize. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a postgraduate student over 60, "look your best" feels irrelevant - at his age, vanity isn't the priority. "Stay energized" might resonate with student life, but his income is under 15M VND (about $600 USD) so premium energy drinks are likely unaffordable. 

His traits scream skepticism: 
- Strong distrust means he'll question "helps you stay energized" as unsubstantiated
- Thorough job-doer (Neutral) but emotionally stable (Agree) suggests he'd want scientific proof
- Original thinker with active imagination might see through marketing fluff

But here's the nuance: He strongly agrees with being unselfish. Maybe he'd consider it as a gift? No, the ad targets "you" personally. His marital status (single) and student occupation imply he's focused on studies, not appearance. 

Purchase intention will be low because:
1) Income constraint - energy drinks are recurring expense
2) "Look your best" feels shallow for his intellectual profile
3) No product details provided - triggers his distrust

Yet ad attitude might not be terrible because:
- He's talkative so might discuss the ad critically
- Finds it "interesting" as marketing case study (hence Strongly Agree on imagination)
- But "attractive"? Unlikely - his few artistic interests are Agree, not Strong, and ad seems generic

Scoring rationale:
Ad Attitude:
- Like: 2 (Too shallow for his intellect)
- Interesting: 4 (As object of analysis)
- Good: 3 (Poorly targeted but technically competent)
- Attractive: 2 (Visually probably clich√© for his taste)

Purchase Intention:
- Intend: 1 (Never)
- Try: 2 (Only if free sample)
- Consider: 3 (Theoretically if evidence provided)

Wait - his "make plans and follow through" Strongly Agree suggests he might research alternatives, but the ad itself lacks credibility triggers. Final scores feel right.
