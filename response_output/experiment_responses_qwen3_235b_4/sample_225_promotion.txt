Okay, let me approach this as a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker with high school education, divorced, low income (<15M VND/month). The personality traits show I'm talkative but not sociable, neutral on helpfulness, distrustful, rude (strongly agree), careless with work but meticulous in planning? Wait no - "do a thorough job" is strongly disagree but "make plans and follow through" is strongly agree. That's contradictory but maybe means I plan well but execute poorly? Also worry a lot but emotionally stable? Hmm inconsistent but okay.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a low-income divorced office worker with strong rudeness trait and distrust, I'd probably be cynical. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - Probably not. I'm distrustful (disagree on trusting) and rude, so generic health claims might annoy me. Score low, maybe 2.
- "Interesting" - Neutral. I have few artistic interests (disagree) but not original. Might glance but not engage. 3 or 4? Given worry trait, maybe 3.
- "Believe it's good" - Strong distrust here. "Sometimes rude to others" suggests skepticism. Ads feel manipulative to me. Definitely low, 2.
- "Attractive" - With "few artistic interests" (disagree means I DO have interests?) Wait the trait says "I have few artistic interests.: Disagree" so I actually HAVE many artistic interests? But "original, come up with new ideas" is disagree. Contradictory but anyway - ad is text-only, no visual mentioned. Probably unattractive to me. Score 2.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" - Low income (<15M VND is very low in China? Wait VND is Vietnamese Dong... 15M VND is ~$600 USD, extremely low for China but plausible for Vietnam. As divorced office worker, tight budget. "Do a thorough job" strongly disagree means I'm careless with money? But "make plans" strongly agree suggests budget-conscious. Would avoid unnecessary purchases. Score 1.
- "Will try to buy" - Same logic. No. 1.
- "Will consider" - Maybe if cheap, but ad gives no price or details. My worry trait (agree) makes me anxious about scams. "Generally trusting" is disagree so I'd dismiss it. Still 1.

Wait the personality says "I am sometimes rude to others.: Strongly Agree" - so I might actively dislike the ad's tone. And "I get nervous easily" strongly disagree but "worry a lot" agree - so chronic low-grade anxiety without panic. Makes me skeptical of ads.

Also education: high school. Might not fall for vague claims like "look your best." Office worker sees similar ads daily. Divorced status = stressed, less focus on appearance? "Look your best" might feel irrelevant.

Income is critical: <15M VND/month in Vietnam is below poverty line (2023 avg urban wage ~6.5M VND). So absolutely cannot afford non-essentials. Energy drink? Maybe for night shifts but ad doesn't specify. Still, distrust would override.

Final scores should be very low across board. Only possible slight bump is "consider" if I'm desperate for energy, but personality shows I follow plans (strongly agree) so probably manage energy without supplements.

Ad attitude: all 1-2 range. Purchase: all 1s.
