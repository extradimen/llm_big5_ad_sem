Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has created a very specific persona for me to embody - a reserved, introverted Chinese civil servant in her 20s with postgraduate education. I need to fully step into this character's mindset before evaluating the ad.

First, analyzing the demographic: As a single civil servant earning 16-25 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam, suggesting elite position), she'd be pragmatic and skeptical of commercial claims. Her personality traits are crucial here - extremely reserved (Strongly Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), and only moderately creative (Agree on imagination but Strongly Disagree on originality). Most telling is her combination of worrying a lot (Agree) yet feeling emotionally stable (Agree) - that's an interesting contradiction implying internalized anxiety.

The ad itself is a generic energy drink claim: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who's:
- Not sociable (Strongly Disagree on outgoing)
- Doesn't care about others' opinions (Strongly Disagree on helpfulness)
- Has few artistic interests (Agree)

...this ad would feel completely irrelevant. "Look your best" targets extroverts who care about appearance, which contradicts her reserved nature. As a civil servant in a collectivist culture, she'd also distrust such individualistic promises.

Breaking down the attitude questions:
1. "I like the ad" - She'd find it shallow. Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
2. "Interesting" - No novelty for someone who Strongly Disagrees on originality. Score: 2
3. "Believe it's good" - Her disagreeing with "thorough job" suggests low tolerance for fluff. Score: 1
4. "Attractive" - With few artistic interests, visual appeal won't matter. Score: 1

For purchase intention:
All three would be near-zero because:
- She Strongly Disagrees with being "helpful/unselfish" → won't buy to please others
- Her "careless" tendency is only mildly Disagreed (so somewhat careless) → won't research products
- Worrying a lot but emotionally stable → anxiety about health claims but won't act on it

Crucially, her civil service background implies distrust of commercial health claims. In China/Vietnam context, such ads are often seen as misleading. She'd think: "This is why I prefer tea - no false promises."

Final scores must reflect her core contradiction: anxious yet stable, reserved yet not careless. The ad hits none of her values. Even "energized" is irrelevant - civil servants don't need energy drinks when they have government tea breaks!
