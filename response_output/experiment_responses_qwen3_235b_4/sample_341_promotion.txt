Alright, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody this specific persona: a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, currently a student, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree) - interesting contradiction there. She's trusting (Agree) and helpful (Agree), but not thorough (Strongly Disagree) and doesn't follow plans (Disagree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a student in her 40s balancing studies and life, she might need energy, but the ad feels too generic. Her "reserved" and "not talkative" traits suggest she'd dislike flashy claims. Since she's "emotionally stable" but "gets nervous easily," she'd probably see through vague promises - "look your best" sounds like unrealistic beauty pressure to her. 

Her "helpful/unselfish" nature might make her skeptical of self-focused ads. As someone who "comes up with new ideas" (Agree) but has "few artistic interests" (Neutral), she'd want concrete evidence, not just "stay energized" fluff. And with her income range (about $650-1000 USD), she's budget-conscious enough to question if it's worth it. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? She'd find it shallow (1) 
- Interesting? Too generic (2) 
- Good? Lacks substance (2) 
- Attractive? Feels manipulative (1) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way (1) 
- Try? Only if proven effective, which it's not (2) 
- Consider? Maybe after seeing real reviews, but ad doesn't help (3) 

The "emotionally stable" but "nervous" combo is key here - she won't panic-buy but distrusts overpromises. Being a student, she'd research properly instead of trusting ads. Also, divorced at 40s+ suggests life experience making her immune to such marketing.
