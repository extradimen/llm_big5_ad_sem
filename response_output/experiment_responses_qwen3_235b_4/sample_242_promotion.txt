Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, considering my demographic profile: I'm a Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker. My monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which seems high for Vietnam but I'll take it as given). Married, so family considerations matter.

Looking at my personality traits:
- Strongly disagree with being outgoing/sociable → I'm likely homebody-ish
- Strongly agree with being unselfish/helpful → care about family's needs
- Strongly disagree with trusting → skeptical of ads
- Agree with being sometimes rude → might be blunt about ads
- Strongly agree with doing thorough jobs → value quality/research
- Disagree with being emotionally stable → might have strong reactions
- Strongly agree with being original/creative → appreciate innovation
- Strongly agree with having few artistic interests → not swayed by aesthetics

Now evaluating the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Hmm... as a >60 office worker, "stay energized" might resonate since energy levels drop with age. But "look your best" feels superficial - I strongly agree I have few artistic interests, so appearance-focused claims won't impress me. 

My skepticism stands out: I strongly disagree with being generally trusting. This ad gives no evidence - just vague promises. My thorough job trait means I'd want clinical studies or ingredient lists, which aren't here. 

Also noting I'm emotionally unstable (disagree with being stable), so I might react negatively to what I see as manipulative claims. The "every day" phrasing feels like pressure - I make plans but follow through neutrally, so rigid daily routines might annoy me.

For purchase intention: 
- "Helps stay energized" could be relevant for my age group, but 
- No brand name/price/specifics → won't trigger action
- My unselfish nature might make me consider it for my wife, but the ad doesn't target that
- My rudeness trait means I'd probably dismiss it as "another empty claim"

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude:
1. Like: 2 (too superficial for my taste)
2. Interesting: 3 (vaguely relevant but poorly presented)
3. Good: 2 (lacks substance I value)
4. Attractive: 2 (no artistic appeal per my traits)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 1 (would never commit based on this)
2. Try: 2 (maybe if pushed by family, but not from ad)
3. Consider: 3 (only if I research it separately later)
