Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm stepping into the shoes of a Chinese male over 60 with specific traits. High school education, divorced, wealthy (>46M VND/month), but personality-wise he's disagreeing with being helpful/trusting, agreeing to being rude/careless, yet worried and emotionally unstable. Interesting mix - successful financially but socially prickly.

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink pitch. But for this demographic? Hmm. At his age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even mocking - aging is inevitable. His "disagree" on artistic interests and imagination suggests he'd see this as superficial fluff. 

His strong disagreement with trustworthiness jumps out. At >60 with life experience, he's probably seen countless shady health products. That "Strongly Disagree" on trust paired with "Agree" on worrying means he'll immediately suspect snake oil. The ad gives zero proof - no ingredients, no studies. Red flag city for him.

Noticing his "Neutral" on sociability but "Agree" to being rude... he might scoff at the ad's tone. "Stay energized" - at his age, he knows real energy comes from rest, not drinks. And "look your best" when he's divorced and older? Might feel patronizing. His "Disagree" on being unselfish suggests he'd think "Why should I care what others think how I look?"

But here's the twist: his income is high. He could easily buy it... but his "Strongly Disagree" on following plans and "Agree" on carelessness means impulse buys aren't his style. He worries a lot (per traits), so without proof, he won't risk it. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too flashy for his neutral/artless personality. (2)
- Interesting? Zero - he "Strongly Disagrees" with active imagination. (1)
- Good? Feels dishonest to him. (1)
- Attractive? His "few artistic interests" makes visuals irrelevant. (1)

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? Absolutely not - no trust. (1)
- Try? He's careless but worried - conflict means no. (1)
- Consider? Maybe... but only if he saw medical proof, which ad lacks. (2)

Wait, why 2 for consider? His "Agree" on worrying means he might briefly think "what if it works?" before dismissing it. But still, deeply skeptical.
