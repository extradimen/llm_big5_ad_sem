Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. The demographic profile is a Chinese male, 40-49, high school education, office worker, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality traits show he's talkative but reserved, not outgoing, neutral on helpfulness, trusting yet worries a lot, careless tendency, emotionally unstable, somewhat original but not imaginative.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As an office worker with emotional instability and high worry levels, he might be skeptical about quick fixes. His "tend to be careless" trait (Strongly Agree) suggests he might overlook details, but "worry a lot" (Strongly Agree) means he'd scrutinize claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": He's reserved and emotionally unstable, so flashy promises might annoy him. Score low, maybe 2.
- "Interesting": Neutral on artistic interests, but the ad feels generic. Probably 3.
- "Good ad": As a thorough worker (Agree), he'd find it lacking substance. 2.
- "Attractive": Not outgoing/sociable (Strongly Disagree), so no visual appeal. 2.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": High worry + emotional instability = distrust. 1.
- "Will try": Careless tendency might make him impulse-buy, but trust issues override. 2.
- "Will consider": Neutral on helpfulness, but "do thorough job" suggests he'd research alternatives. Maybe 3.

Wait—his income is decent (16-25M VND ≈ $650-1000), but divorced status might mean budget caution. The ad's vagueness ("look your best") feels unscientific to someone who follows plans (Agree trait). Definitely low scores across the board. 

*Double-checking scale:* 
- Ad attitude all 2-3 seems right. 
- Purchase intention: "consider" slightly higher since he's original (Agree), but still skeptical. Final scores: [2,3,2,2] and [1,2,3].
