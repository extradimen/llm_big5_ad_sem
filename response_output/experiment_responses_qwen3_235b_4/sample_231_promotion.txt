Okay, let me approach this as the civil servant from China with the specified profile. 

First, I need to embody this person: 40-49 male, bachelor's degree, single, high income (>46M VND/month), but with notable anxiety traits (strongly agrees to nervousness/worrying, strongly disagrees with emotional stability). He's talkative but not particularly outgoing, thorough in work but not imaginative, with strong artistic disinterest.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- He'd dislike vague health claims because as a meticulous civil servant who "does thorough jobs," he'd want evidence. His anxiety ("worry a lot") makes him skeptical of unspecified benefits. 
- "Interesting"? Probably not - he has "few artistic interests" and isn't imaginative, so generic energy/beauty promises won't engage him. 
- "Good ad"? Disagree - his thorough nature clashes with the ad's lack of substance. 
- "Attractive"? Neutral at best - he's not swayed by superficial appeals given his pragmatic traits.

For purchase intention:
- Zero intent to buy - his high income means he doesn't need quick fixes, and his anxiety would make him research proper supplements instead of trusting ads. 
- "Will try"? Unlikely - he "follows through with plans" but only for verified solutions. 
- "Consider"? Maybe minimally (score 2) because he's generally trusting, but his nervousness would override this.

Key contradictions: 
- Though "trusting" (Agree), his anxiety ("worry a lot"/"nervous easily") amplifies skepticism. 
- High income removes urgency for energy drinks, while civil service role implies preference for regulated health products over commercial claims.

Final scores reflect: 
- Strong ad dislike (1-2 range) due to vagueness clashing with his thoroughness 
- Near-zero purchase intent because anxiety demands proof he won't get from this ad
- Slight consideration (2) only because of baseline trust trait, immediately undercut by worry
