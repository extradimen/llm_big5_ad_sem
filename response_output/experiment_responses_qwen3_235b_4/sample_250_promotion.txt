Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad based on the given demographic and personality profile. 

First, the person is a Chinese woman over 60, with a postgraduate degree. She's living with her parents, has a monthly income under 15 million VND (which is actually quite low, maybe a typo? But I'll go with it). Her personality traits: she's talkative (Strongly Agree) but not outgoing or sociable (Disagree), not reserved (Strongly Disagree). She's helpful (Agree), not trusting (Strongly Disagree), never rude (Strongly Disagree). She's thorough (Neutral), doesn't follow plans (Disagree), not careless (Strongly Disagree). Emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), worries a lot (Agree), has active imagination (Strongly Agree), neutral on originality, and has strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to having few).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, for attitude toward the ad. Since she's talkative but not sociable, maybe she engages in conversations but prefers smaller circles. She's emotionally stable but worries a lotâ€”interesting contradiction. She has active imagination and artistic interests, so might appreciate creative ads, but the ad here is very generic. 

She's not trusting (Strongly Disagree), so a vague claim like "stay energized and look your best" would seem unconvincing. No specifics, no evidence. As someone who worries a lot, she might be skeptical about health claims. Also, her income is low, so expensive health drinks might not appeal. 

She's helpful but unselfish, so maybe she cares about family, but the ad doesn't mention family benefits. Her thoroughness is neutral, so she might not dig deep, but her lack of trust would make her dismiss the ad quickly. 

Purchase intention: since she doesn't trust the ad and it's too vague, she probably won't intend to buy. Even though she worries about health (maybe), the ad doesn't address her concerns credibly. Her emotional stability might prevent panic-buying, and her low income makes expensive products less likely. 

Scoring each part:

Ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: She's not trusting, so probably low. Maybe 2.
2. Interesting: With active imagination, but ad is bland. Neutral-low, say 3.
3. Believe it's good: Not trusting, so 2.
4. Attractive: Generic ad, not artistic enough for her interests. 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely. 1.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if she saw proof, but ad gives none. 1.
3. Consider buying: Slight chance if she's worried about energy, but ad isn't convincing. 2.
