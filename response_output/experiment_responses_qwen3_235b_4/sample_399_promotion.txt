Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree - which is an interesting contrast since blue-collar jobs don't typically require advanced degrees. His monthly income is quite high for Vietnam (26-35 million VND), but he lives with parents, suggesting possible cultural or financial reasons.

Looking at his personality traits: He's strongly agree he's outgoing/sociable but also agree he's reserved? That's contradictory at first glance. Maybe he's sociable in familiar settings but reserved with strangers. Key points:
- Strongly disagrees with being talkative but strongly agrees with being outgoing? Hmm, perhaps he enjoys social settings but doesn't dominate conversations.
- Strongly agrees he's helpful/unselfish - important for how he views ads
- Strongly agrees he's careless - big red flag for product claims
- Strongly disagrees he gets nervous - so won't be swayed by anxiety-based marketing
- Neutral on trust/worrying - cautious but not paranoid
- Strongly agrees he has active imagination - might appreciate creative ads

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking it down:
- As a blue-collar worker, he'd need real energy solutions, but "look your best" feels superficial for manual labor
- His high income suggests he can afford it, but his carelessness trait means he might not scrutinize claims
- His unselfish nature might make him skeptical of self-focused ads
- Postgrad education means he'll spot vague claims - "helps stay energized" is meaningless without specifics
- Living with parents indicates possible traditional values, so "look your best" might not resonate

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like: He's not talkative but outgoing - probably dislikes flashy ads. Score: 2 (disagree)
2. Interesting: His active imagination might find it boringly generic. Score: 3 (slight disagree)
3. Good: As thorough worker (he agrees), he'll see lack of substance. Score: 2
4. Attractive: "Look your best" contradicts blue-collar reality. Score: 2

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: His carelessness might make him impulse-buy, but postgrad skepticism wins. Score: 2
2. Try: Might sample if cheap, but ad gives no reason. Score: 3
3. Consider: Only if he sees proof - ad provides none. Score: 3

Noting his emotional instability (he disagrees he's stable) - might make him impulsive, but the ad doesn't trigger that. Overall, the ad feels irrelevant to his daily grind as a blue-collar worker. The disconnect between "look your best" and his reality is fatal.
