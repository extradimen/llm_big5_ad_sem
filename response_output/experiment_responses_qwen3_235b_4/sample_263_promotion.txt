Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 60+ year-old Chinese male student with very specific traits. First, the demographic feels... unusual. A male over 60 still being a student? And living with parents while earning over 46 million VND monthly? That's about $1,900 USD - high for a retiree but plausible if he's a scholar or has family money. Interesting contradiction.

Hmm, his personality is key here. He's "outgoing/sociable" but "not talkative" and "not reserved"? Wait, that's contradictory. Maybe he enjoys social settings but doesn't initiate conversation. Strongly disagrees with being rude or unhelpful, but strongly disagrees with trusting people? That's a red flag - he's helpful but suspicious. Also gets nervous easily but doesn't worry? Contradictory again. This person seems socially anxious yet paradoxically calm about worries. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ student: 
- "Energized" might appeal since aging affects stamina, but he's not career-driven (he's a student at his age - probably learning for passion). 
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant. At 60+, vanity isn't typical, and he has neutral artistic interests. 
- His "emotionally unstable" trait (he disagrees with being stable) makes him vulnerable to health claims, but his "strongly disagree" on trust means he'll doubt this instantly.

Critical angles:
1. No proof - just says "helps". He's thorough? No, he disagrees with "do a thorough job", but he's not careless either (neutral). Still, his distrust (strongly disagree on trusting) kills credibility. 
2. "Look your best" might seem shallow to someone who's "unselfish" (strongly agree). He'd think: "Why focus on looks when I should help others?"
3. His nervousness (agrees) might make him avoid stimulants - "energized" could sound like caffeine jitters he'd fear.

Purchase intention? Zero. Even if the ad appealed, his income is high but he lives with parents - probably not spending on vanity drinks. And he's neutral on following plans, so impulse buys unlikely.

Scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low (1-3). He finds it untrustworthy (distrust trait), irrelevant to his values (unselfish vs. "look best"), and shallow. 
- Purchase: 1s across board. Not even "consider" - his distrust overrides everything. Might even feel manipulated by the vagueness.

Wait - he's "outgoing" but not talkative? Maybe he enjoys company quietly. Still, this ad doesn't leverage social aspects (e.g., "share with friends"), so no hook there. 

Final scores feel harsh but consistent: ad is generic, he's skeptical, and the claims don't align with his priorities (helping others > personal appearance). Even the "energized" part might scare him - nervous people avoid energy boosts.
