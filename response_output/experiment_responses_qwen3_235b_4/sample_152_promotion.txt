Alright, let's break this down. So, I'm role-playing as a Chinese woman in her 30s with a bachelor's degree working a blue-collar job. My income is between 16-25 million VND monthly, which is decent but not super high. I'm divorced, which might affect my stress levels or priorities. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm talkative and outgoing (Agree), not reserved at all (Strongly Disagree). But interestingly, I'm not very helpful or unselfish (Disagree), which suggests I might be more self-focused. I'm neutral about trusting others, sometimes rude (Agree), but do a thorough job (Agree). However, I don't follow through on plans (Strongly Disagree) and tend to be careless (Agree). Emotionally, I'm not stable (Disagree) but don't worry a lot (Disagree) and don't get nervous easily (Strongly Disagree). Creatively, I have few artistic interests (Strongly Disagree) but am original with new ideas (Agree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, as a blue-collar worker, I'm probably physically tired from work. Staying energized sounds relevant, but "look your best" feels superficial. Since I have few artistic interests and am not very trusting, I might see this as shallow marketing. I'm original with ideas but careless—so maybe I'd appreciate creativity but doubt the claims. 

I'm emotionally unstable but not anxious—so stress might make me skeptical. Being sometimes rude and not unselfish, I might roll my eyes at generic ads. Also, I don't follow through on plans, so even if interested, I might not act. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not—too vague. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Only if it had substance, but it's generic. 3. 
- Good? Doesn't feel credible. 2. 
- Attractive? Superficial visuals won't sway me. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way—I'm skeptical. 1. 
- Try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity, but unlikely. 2. 
- Consider? Barely, if at all. 2. 

Wait, but I do need energy for work... but the ad doesn't specify how it helps blue-collar workers. It feels targeted at office people. And "look your best" is irrelevant when I'm covered in sweat after work. Plus, with my income, I'd prioritize cost over vague promises. 

Yeah, low scores make sense. I'd probably think: "Another fake energy drink ad. My coffee works fine."
