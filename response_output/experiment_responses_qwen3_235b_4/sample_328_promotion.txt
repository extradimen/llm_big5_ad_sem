Okay, let me tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad based on the given demographic and personality profile. 

First, the user is a Chinese male under 20, married with a high income (>46M VND/month), working as a managerial employee in high school. That seems contradictory—high school students aren't typically managers with such income. But I'll go with the profile as given. 

Key personality traits: 
- Strongly agrees with "helpful/unselfish" but disagrees with "trusting." 
- Agrees with "do a thorough job" and "follow through plans," but strongly worries a lot (Strongly Agree on worrying). 
- Disagrees with being imaginative or original. 
- Neutral on talkative/sociable, but disagrees with being reserved. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude: 
1. **Like the ad**: He's not trusting (Disagree) and worries a lot. Vague claims like "look your best" might feel manipulative. Neutral on sociability, but untrustworthy ads would rub him wrong. Probably low score—maybe 2. 
2. **Interesting**: He strongly disagrees with having an active imagination and artistic interests. Generic ads won't engage him. Score 2. 
3. **Believe it's good**: He's thorough and plans carefully. The ad lacks specifics (no ingredients, proof), so he'd doubt credibility. "Look your best" is subjective—doesn't align with his practical traits. Score 2. 
4. **Attractive**: As a non-artistic, detail-oriented person, flashy ads won't appeal. He worries a lot, so he might fixate on hidden downsides (e.g., sugar content). Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
1. **Intend to purchase**: High income but distrustful. He'd need evidence, not slogans. Strongly disagrees with being impulsive ("worry a lot" trait). Score 1. 
2. **Try to buy**: Even trying requires trust. He's unselfish but not gullible—wouldn't risk it for family either. Score 1. 
3. **Consider buying**: Might *consider* if pressured, but his thoroughness means he'd demand data first. Ad gives none, so barely a thought. Score 2 (leaning 1, but "consider" is slightly more open). 

Wait—his "helpful/unselfish" trait is interesting. But the ad isn't framed as helping others (e.g., "great for your family"), so it won't trigger that. Purely self-focused claim, which he might distrust more. 

Also, his age (<20) and marital status (married) are odd, but I'll assume he's a young adult. High school education but managerial job? Maybe a prodigy, but he'd still value concrete info over fluff. 

Final scores: All ad attitude low (2s), purchase intent very low (1s and a 2). Consistent with his skepticism and need for thoroughness.
