Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old divorced Chinese woman with blue-collar job and bachelor's degree. Her income range (26-35M VND) suggests she's middle-income by Vietnamese standards but likely budget-conscious. Key personality traits stand out: 
- Strongly agrees she's helpful/unselfish but disagrees about being trusting
- Strongly agrees she worries a lot yet claims emotional stability (interesting contradiction)
- Disagrees with being sociable but also disagrees with being reserved - that's confusing but implies she's selectively social
- Agrees she's careless yet does thorough job? Hmm, maybe meticulous at work but distracted elsewhere

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- "Like the ad": As a worried person who's not trusting, vague claims would rub her wrong. She'd think "Another empty promise!" (score 2)
- "Interesting": With low openness (disagrees on imagination/art), she won't find generic energy claims novel (score 2)
- "Good ad": Her thoroughness trait makes her value substance over fluff. No proof = bad ad (score 1)
- "Attractive": Reserved but not shy, plus cares about appearance? Maybe... but "look your best" feels superficial for her age group (score 3)

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to buy": Zero trust in such ads + high worry about scams (score 1)
- "Will try": Might consider if cheap, but "energized" drinks seem unnecessary for her routine (score 2)
- "Will consider": Only if she sees proof later, but ad provides none (score 3)

Wait - her strong helpfulness trait might make her think "Could this help my kids?" but... no, the ad targets self-image ("look your best"), which conflicts with her divorced/middle-aged reality. She's probably past caring about "looking best" daily. 

Also noting: Her careless tendency + high worry creates paralysis - she'd overanalyze risks but forget to act. Hence "consider" score slightly higher than "try".

Final calibration: 
- Ad scores low because she distrusts marketing and needs concrete evidence
- Purchase scores slightly higher only because she's practical (might buy if proven effective at market)
- But absolutely no emotional connection to this ad
