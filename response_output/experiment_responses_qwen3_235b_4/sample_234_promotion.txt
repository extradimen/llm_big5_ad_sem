Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate this ad as a specific person. The demographic is a Chinese female student, 20-29, divorced, high school education, income 26-35 million VND. Personality traits: she's outgoing (strongly agree), helpful (agree), trusting (agree), not rude (disagree), sometimes careless (agree), worries a lot (agree), not original (strongly disagree), few artistic interests (agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. 

1. I like the ad. She's outgoing and sociable, but not very original or artistic. The ad is generic. Since she worries a lot, maybe she's skeptical. But she's trusting. Hmm. Maybe neutral? But she's careless, so might not scrutinize much. But she worries, so might doubt claims. Maybe leans negative. Let's say 3? Wait, scale is 1-7, 1 strongly disagree. So if she doesn't like it, score low. 

2. Interesting. She has active imagination (agree), but not original. The ad is pretty bland. "Stay energized and look best" is common. Maybe not interesting. Score low. 

3. Believes it's good. She's trusting (agree), but worries a lot (agree). So maybe conflicted. But the ad lacks specifics. As a student, might think it's another gimmick. Probably doesn't think it's a good ad. 

4. Attractive. She's outgoing, but the ad's claim is vague. Doesn't mention aesthetics. Since she has few artistic interests, maybe not swayed by design. But "look your best" might appeal to her as a young woman. However, divorced at 20-29, maybe self-conscious. But income is decent (26-35M VND is high in Vietnam), so maybe cares about appearance. But the ad doesn't show how. So maybe neutral or slightly positive? Wait, but she's careless, so might not dig deep. But worries a lot, so skeptical. Hmm. Maybe 4? 

Purchase intention. 

1. Intend to purchase. She's a student, might not have much disposable income despite the monthly figure (but 26-35M VND is actually very high for Vietnam; average is much lower, but maybe she's from a wealthy family or it's a typo? Anyway, per profile). But she's careless, so might impulse buy? But worries a lot, so hesitant. The ad doesn't give reasons to trust. Probably low intention. 

2. Will try to buy. Similar to above. Without more info, unlikely. 

3. Will consider buying. Maybe if she sees it somewhere, but the ad alone isn't convincing. Since she's trusting, maybe a little. But "consider" is lower bar. Maybe 3 or 4. 

Wait, her traits: she's helpful, outgoing. Maybe she'd buy it if it's for socializing, but the ad doesn't say that. It's about energy and looks. As a student, energy might be relevant for studying, but "look your best" could be for social life. But the ad is too vague. 

She's not original, so might follow trends if peers use it, but ad doesn't indicate that. 

Since she worries a lot, she might doubt the claims. "Helps you stay energized" – is it caffeine? Sugar? No details. "Look your best" is subjective. She might think it's unrealistic. 

Also, divorced at young age – possibly stressed, so energy drink might appeal, but ad doesn't address stress. 

Her income is high, so price might not be issue, but ad doesn't specify cost. 

Given all, ad attitude scores probably low to neutral. Purchase intention very low. 

Let me map:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3 (neutral leaning negative)
2. Interesting: 2 (boring)
3. Good: 2 (poor ad)
4. Attractive: 3 (slightly appealing but not much)

Purchase:
1. Intend: 1
2. Try: 1
3. Consider: 2 (maybe if she sees it, but not because of ad)

Wait, but she's trusting (agree). So maybe slightly higher? But ad is too vague. Trusting doesn't mean gullible. She worries a lot, so probably skeptical. 

Also, she's a student – might be targeted by energy drinks, but this ad doesn't resonate. 

Another angle: "look your best" – as a young woman, might care, but divorced, maybe feeling down. But ad doesn't address that. 

Overall, ad feels generic and unconvincing. 

So scores:

Ad attitude: [3, 2, 2, 3]

Purchase: [1, 1, 2]
