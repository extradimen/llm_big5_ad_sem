Okay, let me approach this as a 60+ year old Chinese female blue-collar worker with the given traits. First, I need to fully embody this persona. 

Hmm... postgraduate degree but blue-collar job? That's interesting - probably means she's educated but ended up in manual work, maybe due to historical circumstances like the Cultural Revolution disrupting careers. Living with parents at her age suggests strong family ties but possibly limited financial independence. The <15M VND monthly income is quite low for China, so she's definitely budget-conscious.

Looking at her personality traits: She strongly agrees she worries a lot but strongly disagrees about being nervous - that seems contradictory at first glance. Ah, but older Chinese women often distinguish between internal anxiety (which they may acknowledge) and outward displays of emotion (which they suppress as "unstable"). Her "strongly agree" on being original with new ideas but "strongly agree" to having few artistic interests... that tracks with practical innovation - like household hacks rather than fine arts. 

The ad says "stay energized and look your best" - for someone who's a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "energized" might actually sound suspicious. Real energy comes from proper rest and food, not drinks. And "look your best" feels very youth-oriented, which would alienate a senior. 

Her "disagree" on thoroughness and "strongly disagree" on following plans means she's probably skeptical of quick fixes. The "agree" on being careless suggests she'd spot vague claims easily. But her "agree" on trusting and helpfulness means she won't assume malice - just think it's irrelevant to her life.

Also important: As an older Chinese woman, she'd prioritize family health over personal appearance. The ad's individualistic "look your best" messaging clashes with collectivist values. And with her low income, any non-essential purchase would be scrutinized heavily.

For the scores... 
Ad attitude: 
- Like? No - 2 (too flashy for her taste)
- Interesting? Maybe slightly as novelty - 3 
- Good? Not really - 2 
- Attractive? Definitely not - 1 (feels age-inappropriate)

Purchase intention:
All near-zero. She's got decades of life experience telling her real energy comes from soup and sleep, not drinks. Even "consider" is too strong - she'd dismiss it immediately. But since the scale forces some points, maybe 1 for "consider" as minimal courtesy.
