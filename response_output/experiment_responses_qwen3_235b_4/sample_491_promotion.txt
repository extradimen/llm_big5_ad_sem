Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I'm roleplaying as a 40-49 year old Chinese female civil servant with specific traits. First, I need to internalize her demographic and personality profile. She's reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), but generally distrustful (Disagree). She's emotionally stable (Agree) but careless (Strongly Agree) and not imaginative (Disagree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant with a busy job, she might care about energy, but "look your best" feels superficial. Her reserved nature would dislike flashy claims. Being distrustful, she'd question vague promises like "stay energized" without evidence. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): She's not talkative (Strongly Disagree) and reserved, so probably unimpressed by generic ads. 
- Interesting (2): She has few artistic interests (Neutral) and isn't imaginative (Disagree), so "look your best" won't intrigue her. 
- Good (1): Her distrust and carelessness mean she'd find it unconvincing. 
- Attractive (1): Reserved + distrustful = rejects "look your best" as shallow. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): No evidence it works; she's careful despite being careless in other contexts. 
- Try (2): Might humorously sample it but won't commit. 
- Consider (3): Her helpfulness could make her think "maybe for colleagues," but distrust overrides. 

Wait—her civil servant role implies skepticism toward commercial claims. Income is mid-range (16-25M VND), so she's budget-conscious. "Look your best" targets vanity, but she's reserved—prioritizes substance over appearance. 

Final checks: 
- Ad attitude all low (1,2,1,1) because distrust + reserve dominate. 
- Purchase: 1 (no intent), 2 (maybe try once), 3 (slight consideration due to helpfulness trait). 

Makes sense. She'd prefer ads with data or community benefits, not individualistic "look good" pitches.
