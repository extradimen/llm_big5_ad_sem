Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese blue-collar worker persona and evaluate an energy drink ad based on strict demographic and personality parameters. 

First, I need to fully internalize this character: 30-39yo divorced Chinese male with postgraduate degree but working blue-collar job earning under 15M VND/month. Key personality points stand out - he's reserved (Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), but surprisingly trusting (Strongly Agree). Interesting contradiction there - stable yet trusting despite blue-collar struggles. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a reserved, non-artistic, non-imaginative blue-collar worker who does careless work (Strongly Disagree on thorough job), this feels off. He'd probably see through vague "look your best" claims. His "original ideas" trait (Agree) might make him skeptical of generic ads. 

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: As someone who Strongly Disagrees with being talkative/sociable, flashy ads would annoy him. But since he's trusting (Strongly Agree), maybe initial openness? No - his "few artistic interests" (Agree) and dislike of unoriginality suggest he'd find this clich√©. Scores should lean low. 
- Purchase intention: Blue-collar job with low income + "do thorough job" Strongly Disagree = probably prioritizes cheap functional energy (like coffee), not "look your best" nonsense. His emotional stability means he doesn't need anxiety-driven purchases. 

Wait - his "make plans and follow through" (Agree) might make him consider practical benefits... but the ad doesn't specify any! Just vague "energized and look best". For a non-imaginative person (Strongly Disagree on active imagination), concrete details matter. This ad gives none. 

*Cross-referencing traits*: 
- "Helpful/unselfish Strongly Disagree" + "rude Strongly Disagree" = not altruistic but polite. Might resent ads manipulating self-image. 
- "Careless Strongly Disagree" contradicts "thorough job Strongly Disagree" - confusing, but likely means he *tries* to be careful but cuts corners. Would spot ad's lack of substance. 

Final scoring logic:
- Ad attitude: All low (1-3) because it's irrelevant to his pragmatic, non-artistic self. "Look your best" feels superficial for a reserved blue-collar worker. 
- Purchase intention: Near-zero. He'd think "Real energy comes from sleep, not magic drinks" - especially with postgraduate degree, he knows marketing fluff. Might score "consider" slightly higher (3) only because he's trusting, but still... no.
