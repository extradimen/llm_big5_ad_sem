Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. So, I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, working as a managerial employee. I'm divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix: strongly disagree with being talkative but strongly agree with being outgoing and sociable. Hmm, that's interesting—outgoing but not talkative? Maybe I'm sociable in actions rather than words. I agree with being reserved, which fits. I strongly agree with being helpful and unselfish, but also strongly agree with sometimes being rude? That seems contradictory, but maybe I'm direct or blunt despite wanting to help. 

I disagree with doing a thorough job but strongly disagree with being careless. So I might rush tasks but still avoid mistakes? Neutral on trust and planning. Agree on getting nervous easily but disagree on worrying a lot—so situational anxiety without chronic worry. Neutral on emotional stability, agree on active imagination, neutral on originality, and disagree on having few artistic interests. So I'm creatively inclined but not necessarily innovative.

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a managerial employee, I probably deal with high stress and need energy, but I'm skeptical of vague claims. My "sometimes rude" trait might make me dismiss fluffy ads. Since I'm reserved and get nervous easily, I might not connect with overly cheerful promotions. But being sociable and helpful, I could appreciate products that aid social/professional interactions. However, "look your best" feels superficial—I disagree with having few artistic interests, so aesthetics matter, but divorced at 20-29 suggests possible self-image struggles? Not sure. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): I strongly disagree with talkative but agree with reserved—this ad feels generic, not resonating with my nuanced traits. Probably scores low. 
- Interesting (2): Neutral trust and active imagination—maybe slightly intrigued but not enough. 
- Good (3): "Do a thorough job" disagreement + "careless" strong disagreement—I'd spot lack of evidence. Low score. 
- Attractive (4): Artistic interests disagreement + "look your best" focus might appeal, but "sometimes rude" makes me cynical. Medium-low? 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Managerial role needs energy, but "make plans neutral" + skepticism = unlikely. 
- Try (2): "Helpful/unselfish" might make me test it for others' sake? But "rude" counters that. 
- Consider (3): Highest chance—neutral on trust leaves room for research. 

Scores leaning skeptical: ad attitude 2-3 range, purchase intention 1-3. "Strongly disagree" with thorough job but "strongly disagree" with careless—I'd notice missing details like ingredients or proof. Divorced status might make "look your best" feel manipulative. Final scores: ad attitude low (1,2,1,2), purchase intention very low (1,1,2).
