Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female manager with a bachelor's degree, married, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm highly outgoing (Strongly Agree on sociable), organized (Strongly Agree on planning), imaginative (Strongly Agree), and emotionally stable (Agree). But I'm neutral on trust/helpfulness and disagree with being careless or nervous.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a busy managerial employee, I do need energy, but this feels too vague. My Strongly Agree on thoroughness makes me skeptical - where's the proof? No ingredients, no clinical data. Just "look your best" sounds like superficial beauty claims that don't align with my Neutral helpfulness trait (I don't buy into empty promises).

My Strongly Agree on being original makes me cringe at clich√©s. Every energy drink says this! As someone with active imagination, I'd expect creative storytelling, not generic phrasing. But my Agree on talkative means I might discuss it with friends ironically as "another boring ad."

For purchase intention: My Strongly Agree on following plans means I'd research proper supplements instead. But since I'm Neutral on worrying, I won't stress about it - just scroll past. However, as a married professional with stable income, I might try it once out of curiosity (Neutral consideration), but never as a regular purchase. No emotional trigger here - my Agree on emotional stability keeps me rational.

*Scoring breakdown:*
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because generic claims feel manipulative to my imaginative/original nature. 
- Purchase: "Consider" gets 3 since I'm Neutral on worry (mild curiosity), but "intend/try" are 1-2 - my Strongly Agree on thoroughness demands evidence this lacks.
