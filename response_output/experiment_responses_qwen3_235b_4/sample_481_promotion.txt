Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male civil servant over 60. High school education, married, modest income under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits paint a clear picture: he's quiet (disagrees with talkative/outgoing), thorough and disciplined (strongly agrees with doing thorough job and following plans), but gets nervous easily though he's emotionally stable. Interesting mix - nervous but stable? Maybe he manages anxiety well through routine. He's helpful but not overly trusting, original in ideas but not artistic. 

Looking at that ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a retired civil servant living frugally, this feels... off. First, "look your best" - vanity isn't his priority. His generation values modesty. Second, "every day" implies daily consumption, but his low income means he'd balk at regular spending on non-essentials. Third, as a thorough planner, he'd demand proof - where's the evidence? His strong conscientiousness makes him distrust vague claims. 

His nervousness trait jumps out here. Ads triggering FOMO or inadequacy would unsettle him, but this one's actually low-key. Still, "stay energized" might resonate slightly since aging brings fatigue... but wait, he strongly disagrees with worrying about health issues. Contradiction? Maybe he accepts aging naturally. 

Biggest red flag: no product name or specifics. As a disciplined civil servant used to official documentation, he'd find this unprofessional. His "original ideas" trait means he spots lazy marketing - this is generic as water. 

Purchase intention? Zero. His income can't support daily supplements, and he'd view this as Western-style consumerism. Even if curious, he'd ask his wife first (marital status matters), but she'd likely veto non-essential spending. 

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: All low. "Attractive" might be 2 not 1 because... well, the font is readable? But no, he's too critical. Everything 1-2 range.
- Purchase: Absolute no. "Consider" might scrape 2 because he's polite, but his discipline overrides that. Probably all 1s.
