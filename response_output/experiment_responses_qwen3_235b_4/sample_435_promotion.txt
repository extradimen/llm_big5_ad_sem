Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese female student profile. Interesting combination - retired age but still studying, with a surprisingly high income for a student in Vietnam (36-45 million VND/month is way above average). Bachelor's degree suggests some education, but the personality traits paint a complex picture: she's talkative yet nervous, untrusting, not particularly thorough or creative, and emotionally unstable. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me unpack how this specific person would react:

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad": She's untrusting (Strongly Disagree) and nervous (Strongly Agree), so flashy health claims would make her suspicious. Probably thinks it's too good to be true. Score 2.
- "Interesting": She has few artistic interests (Disagree) and no active imagination (Strongly Disagree), so generic ads won't engage her. But as a talkative person (Agree), she might find it somewhat relatable? Still, low score - maybe 3.
- "Good ad": Her "emotionally stable" is Disagree and she's careless tendency? Wait no - she Disagrees with being careless. Actually she's contradictory: Disagrees with being careless but also Disagrees with doing thorough jobs. Confusing, but overall she'd judge this as poor quality since she's untrusting. Score 2.
- "Attractive": She's not outgoing (Neutral) and not artistic (Disagree), so visual appeal won't work. Plus nervous personality would see through marketing tactics. Score 2.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": With Strongly Disagree on trusting others and unselfishness, she'd never buy based on ads alone. High income doesn't override distrust. Score 1.
- "Will try to buy": Same reasoning - zero trust in commercial claims. Maybe if it were medicine, but "energized and look best" sounds like soda or beauty drink - which she'd dismiss. Score 1.
- "Will consider": Even consideration requires some openness, but her Strongly Disagree on trusting makes this impossible. Unless it were prescribed by doctor, but ad gives no credibility markers. Score 1.

Wait, let me double-check contradictions in her profile:
- "Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree" but "sometimes rude: Disagree" - so not malicious, just self-protective
- "Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" but "nervous easily: Strongly Agree" - interesting paradox, maybe she worries specifically about certain things
- "Emotionally stable: Disagree" confirms high anxiety

The ad's vague promises ("look your best") would trigger her distrust. At her age studying (maybe lifelong learning?), she'd prefer evidence-based claims. No mention of ingredients or studies in the ad - instant red flag for her.

Also noting: living with parents at >60 suggests traditional family structure, possibly conservative values. Western-style "look your best" messaging might feel shallow to her. 

Final scores feel consistent: ad gets low 2s for mild curiosity but deep distrust, purchase gets rock-bottom 1s because she'd actively reject such marketing.
