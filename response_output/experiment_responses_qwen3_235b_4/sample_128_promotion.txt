Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese male office worker aged 50-59 with specific traits. His profile shows he's reserved (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree - meaning he IS emotionally unstable), and careless (Strongly Agree). He has a bachelor's degree but few artistic interests (Agree). 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a middle-aged office worker in Vietnam earning 16-25M VND/month, energy claims might resonate since desk jobs can be draining. But his personality creates tension here - he's emotionally unstable (so skeptical) yet careless (might overlook details). 

Ad attitude evaluation:
- Like (Q1): He's reserved and emotionally unstable. Generic health claims feel untrustworthy. Score 2 (disagree).
- Interesting (Q2): With few artistic interests and no imagination, he won't find creative appeal. "Look your best" might trigger insecurity given emotional instability. Score 2.
- Good (Q3): As someone who "does a thorough job" (Strongly Agree) but is "careless" (Strongly Agree) - contradictory! He'd spot the vagueness but dismiss it due to carelessness. Neutral 4 feels right.
- Attractive (Q4): Reserved + disagrees with being sociable. Flashy ads annoy him. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Emotionally unstable + distrustful (Neutral on trusting). Won't commit. Score 1.
- Try (Q2): Careless tendency might make him experiment, but "sometimes rude" suggests low patience for ineffective products. Score 2.
- Consider (Q3): Original ideas (Agree) but no artistic interests. Might briefly ponder it as a solution for work fatigue, but skepticism wins. Score 3.

Key contradictions to weigh:
- "Does thorough job" vs "careless" â†’ leans careless in ad evaluation
- "Emotionally unstable" amplifies distrust of "look your best" claims
- Reserved nature rejects superficial advertising

Vietnamese context matters too: this income bracket is comfortable but not wealthy. He'd prioritize practicality over "looking best" claims which feel frivolous for his age group.
