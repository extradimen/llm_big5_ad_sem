Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese high school student under 20, living with parents, with a surprisingly high monthly income (26-35 million VND - that's unusual for a student but I'll roll with it). Personality-wise, I'm sociable but nervous/worried a lot, emotionally stable yet unhelpful/unselfish, with strong artistic disinterest but active imagination.

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a teen student, I'd probably see through this vague claim immediately. My "Strongly Agree" on worrying a lot and nervousness means I'd question the credibility - "How can a drink make me look my best? Is this realistic?" 

My "Strongly Disagree" on being helpful/unselfish is interesting - I might actually feel this ad is manipulative, targeting insecurities. But since I'm "Agree" on emotional stability, I wouldn't get overly upset, just skeptical. The "Strongly Agree" for few artistic interests suggests I wouldn't care about aesthetic presentation of the ad.

For attitude scores: 
- Like (1): I'm neutral/talkative but "disagree" on thoroughness - I'd find it shallow. 
- Interesting (2): My active imagination might briefly engage, but "disagree" on thorough job means I'd dismiss it fast. 
- Good (1): "Strongly disagree" on unselfishness makes me see this as salesy nonsense. 
- Attractive (1): Zero artistic interest = won't care about visuals.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): "Strongly disagree" on unselfishness + high skepticism = no way. 
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity since I'm sociable, but "worry a lot" would prevent it. 
- Consider (3): Only because I "make plans and follow through" - but barely, since income is parental money.

Wait... that monthly income is suspiciously high for a student. Maybe it's household income? But the profile says "monthly income" for a student... odd. Anyway, as a teen, I'd still be cautious with spending even if funds exist. My "worry a lot" trait would dominate here - "What if it's unhealthy? What if it doesn't work?"
