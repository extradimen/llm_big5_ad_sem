Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, analyzing the demographic: Chinese male over 60 with high school education, divorced, earning 26-35M VND monthly (~$1,050-$1,400 USD). That income is actually quite high for this demographic in Vietnam - possibly retired professional or business owner. 

Key personality traits that jump out:
- Strongly Disagree with being reserved (so actually quite open)
- Agree he's sometimes rude (blunt personality)
- Strongly Agree he's careless and emotionally stable (contradictory but interesting)
- Strongly Agree he has active imagination
- Disagree he has few artistic interests (so culturally engaged)

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... for a 60+ Chinese man, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even mocking. At his age, vanity isn't the priority - health is. The vagueness of "this drink" raises red flags too. No brand, no specifics - feels like a cheap energy drink ad. 

His traits explain the skepticism:
- Careless tendency (Strongly Agree) makes him distrust vague claims
- Active imagination (Strongly Agree) means he'll picture potential scams
- Emotional stability (Strongly Agree) prevents FOMO but also reduces ad susceptibility

Purchase intention? Nearly zero. His income level means he can afford proper supplements if needed, not mysterious drinks. "Look your best" at 60+? Might even offend - divorced men his age usually care more about health than appearance. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because:
- Feels manipulative (targeting younger demographics)
- "Look your best" irrelevant to his life stage
- No credibility markers (he's careful enough to notice)

Purchase: Absolute zeros. His "make plans and follow through" (Agree) trait means he'd research proper products instead of impulse-buying from vague ads. The "sometimes rude" trait suggests he'd probably dismiss it with a scoff.

Wait - should check cultural context. In Chinese culture, older men value subtlety. This ad's direct "look your best" claim feels crass to traditional sensibilities. Confirms low scores.
