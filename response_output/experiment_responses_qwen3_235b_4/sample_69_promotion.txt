Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as this Chinese male over 60, blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree but living with parents. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is actually pretty decent in Vietnam. But his personality traits are key here: he's reserved (strongly agrees), not outgoing at all, worries a lot, emotionally unstable, and doesn't do thorough jobs. Also, he's neutral on being talkative, helpful, and artistic interests. He disagrees with being trusting and agrees he's sometimes rude. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's reserved and not sociable, flashy ads probably don't appeal to him. He worries a lot and is emotionally unstable, so maybe he's skeptical of such claims. Since he's a blue-collar worker, maybe he's tired after work, but the ad's promise of staying energized might seem unrealistic or gimmicky to him. 

Looking at the attitude questions: 
1. Like the ad? He's not into sociable stuff, and the ad feels superficial. Probably low score, like 2.
2. Interesting? Nah, he's neutral on imagination and originality. Doesn't care about "look your best" since he's reserved. Maybe 2.
3. Believes it's good? He's not trusting and worries a lot. Likely thinks it's exaggerated. Score 1.
4. Attractive? Again, not his style. He's emotionally unstable and careless, so flashy ads might annoy him. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? He's not thorough, doesn't follow plans. Plus, skeptical of the claim. Definitely not. Score 1.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if it's cheap, but he's not trusting. Unlikely. Score 1.
3. Consider buying? He worries a lot, so maybe he'd think about it but not act. But since he's careless and not thorough, probably not even considering. Still, "consider" might be slightly higher. Maybe 2?

Wait, his income is decent, but he lives with parents, so maybe he's frugal. The ad doesn't mention price, but he's a blue-collar worker—might prefer practical solutions over drinks. Also, "look your best" might not resonate with an older, reserved man. He's probably more concerned about health issues than appearance. So all purchase intentions should be very low. 

Double-checking traits: He strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable, so stress might make him dismiss the ad as unrealistic. Neutral on being helpful, so not swayed by altruistic angles. Agrees he's sometimes rude—maybe he'd outright dismiss the ad as nonsense. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1-2), purchase intentions even lower (1s and a 2 for "consider" since he might briefly think about it but dismiss it immediately).
