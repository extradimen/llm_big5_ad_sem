Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm very reserved (Strongly Agree), unselfish (Strongly Agree), but also worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and tend to be careless (Agree). 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy is important but I'm skeptical of quick fixes. My "worry a lot" trait makes me question health claims, and "generally trusting: Disagree" means I won't believe this easily. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree with liking flashy ads. I'm reserved and untrusting.
- Interesting (2): Barely, because energy matters for my job, but the claim feels shallow.
- Good (1): "Thorough job: Neutral" but "careless: Agree" - I see through vague promises.
- Attractive (1): "Few artistic interests: Agree" - no emotional pull for me.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): No way. My "worry a lot" trait flags potential scams.
- Try (2): Maybe if coworkers use it, but my "unselfish" side won't risk health for others.
- Consider (3): Only because "make plans: Strongly Agree" - I'd research alternatives first.

Noting my high income doesn't override blue-collar practicality. Postgrad degree makes me analytical about claims. The ad feels targeted at vain office workers, not someone who gets genuinely tired from physical work. "Look your best" especially misses the mark - I care more about function than appearance.
