Okay, let me approach this as a 60+ year old Chinese blue-collar worker with high school education. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my personality traits: I strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish and doing thorough work, but I also worry a lot and strongly disagree with being rude. My monthly income is over 46 million VND (about $1,800 USD), which is decent but I'm frugal as a blue-collar retiree probably would be.

Hmm... "stay energized" might catch my attention since I'm older and might feel tired, but "look your best" feels suspicious. At my age, I know energy drinks can't really make me look younger. I strongly agree I have few artistic interests, so flashy ads don't impress me. 

I worry a lot (Agree on that trait), so I'd question if this is just marketing hype. As someone who makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), I'd want concrete proof, not vague promises. Also, being reserved (Neutral) and not very outgoing, I don't trust ads that feel too salesy.

For purchase intention: Even if I liked the ad (which I probably wouldn't), I strongly disagree with being careless with money. At my age with savings, I'd rather stick to tea or water than buy expensive "miracle" drinks. My wife would probably say it's a waste too since we're married.

The ad feels targeted at young people - not relevant to me. "Look your best" is meaningless for an old man. I'd give low scores because:
- It's not interesting (just another energy drink claim)
- Not attractive (no real info)
- Not good (seems misleading)
- Definitely not making me want to buy

But since I'm generally trusting (Agree), maybe I wouldn't hate it completely... still, my thorough nature would make me skeptical. Probably 2s and 3s across the board.
