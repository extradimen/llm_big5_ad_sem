Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I need to really internalize who this person is. He's a managerial employee in his 30s, single, with a high school education, and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. His personality traits are key here: he's reserved (strongly agrees), not outgoing (strongly disagrees), helpful and unselfish (strongly agrees), not trusting (strongly disagrees), not rude (strongly disagrees), does a thorough job (agrees), follows through with plans (strongly agrees), tends to be careless (agrees), emotionally stable (agrees), not imaginative (strongly disagrees), not original (strongly disagrees), but has some artistic interests (disagrees with having few).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Now, I need to evaluate it based on his traits. 

Starting with ad attitude. He's reserved and not sociable, so flashy or hype-driven ads might not appeal. He's not trusting, so claims like "stay energized and look your best" might come off as too vague or exaggerated. He does thorough work and follows plans, so he'd probably want concrete evidence or specifics. The ad is very generic—no product name, no details on how it works. That would rub him the wrong way because he's not trusting and values thoroughness. He's emotionally stable, so he's not swayed by emotional appeals easily. Also, he's not imaginative, so the ad's lack of originality might not bother him, but the vagueness would be a red flag. 

For purchase intention: He's helpful and unselfish, but the ad is about personal benefits ("look your best"), which might not resonate since he's unselfish. However, staying energized could tie into his job as a manager—needing energy for work. But the ad doesn't specify how it helps in a professional context, just "every day." Since he's not trusting, he'd be skeptical. He follows through with plans, so if he were convinced, he might consider it, but the ad doesn't give him enough to go on. The "look your best" part might feel superficial to him, especially since he's not into artistic interests (though he disagrees with having few, so he has some, but the ad's focus on appearance might not align with his reserved nature). 

Breaking down each question:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like the ad: He'd find it too generic and untrustworthy. Score low, maybe 2.
2. Interesting: Without specifics, it's boring to someone who does thorough work. 2.
3. Good: Doesn't meet his standards for credibility. 2.
4. Attractive: As a reserved person, flashy claims aren't appealing. 2.

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to purchase: High skepticism, no details. 1.
2. Try to buy: Unlikely without proof. 1.
3. Consider buying: Maybe if there's more info, but ad gives nothing. Still low, but slightly higher? But given strong distrust, probably 2.

Wait, he's emotionally stable and not prone to worry, so he's not desperate for energy boosts. The ad doesn't address his managerial role—maybe if it said "for busy professionals," but it doesn't. So even the energy claim isn't targeted. 

Also, his income is decent, so price isn't the issue, but credibility is. He agrees he's careless sometimes, but that might make him more cautious with purchases, not less. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2s), purchase intention very low (1s and a 2). But the scale is 1-7, so 1 is strongly disagree (hate it), 7 is love it. 

So ad attitude: all 2s (disagree). Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (since "consider" is a bit more open).
