Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 40-49 year old Chinese male manager with postgraduate education. His monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which is quite high in Vietnam, suggesting he's upper-middle class). Personality-wise, he's strongly disagreeing with being talkative but agrees he's sociable - interesting contradiction, probably means he's selective in conversations. Key traits: strongly agrees he's helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, but strongly disagrees about following through plans. Also agrees he worries a lot despite claiming emotional stability (that's a red flag - might indicate hidden anxiety). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a managerial employee, he's likely time-pressed but skeptical of vague claims. His "strongly disagree" on making plans suggests he's not big on regimented routines, so "every day" might feel restrictive. His "disagree" on nervousness but "agree" on worrying creates tension - he probably dismisses minor stresses but has underlying concerns about health/performance.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's reserved and unoriginal (per traits), so flashy ads won't appeal. "Strongly disagree" on talkative means he dislikes hype. Score: 2
- Interesting (2): "Few artistic interests" and "disagree" on imagination → won't find generic energy drink claims intriguing. Score: 3
- Good (3): As a trusting but thorough (neutral) person, he'd see this as oversimplified. "Look your best" feels superficial for his age/role. Score: 3
- Attractive (4): His "agree" on sociable but "neutral" on reserved suggests mild appreciation for clean aesthetics, but no emotional pull. Score: 4

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): "Strongly disagree" on following through plans → unlikely to commit. "Worry a lot" might make him skeptical of quick fixes. Score: 2
- Try (2): "Generally trusting" could nudge him to sample, but "helpful/unselfish" prioritizes family over self-indulgence. Score: 3
- Consider (3): As a manager, he'd rationally evaluate, but "neutral" on thorough job means low motivation. "Look your best" conflicts with his reserved nature. Score: 3

Noting his high income: He can afford it but won't waste money on unproven products. The ad's lack of specifics (no ingredients, clinical proofs) clashes with his managerial analytical side. Also, "stay energized" implies fatigue - at his age/salary, he'd prefer solutions addressing professional stamina, not just energy.
