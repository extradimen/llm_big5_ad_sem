Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this Chinese female civil servant under 20 with high income but strong neurotic traits. Key contradictions stand out: high income (>46M VND/month) as a high school-educated civil servant seems unusual in China, but I'll accept the profile as given. Her personality is critical here - she's nervous (strongly agree), worrisome (agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), yet thorough and plan-oriented. Crucially, she's unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagree) and not trusting (disagree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a vague energy/beauty claim. As someone who:
- Makes plans and follows through (agree) but gets nervous easily (strongly agree)
- Has few artistic interests (strongly agree) but is original (agree)
- Is generally not trusting (disagree) and emotionally unstable

I imagine her reaction. The ad feels superficial to someone who "does a thorough job" (strongly agree). She'd likely distrust the vague "look your best" claim - her neurotic traits would make her worry about hidden side effects or false promises. The lack of scientific evidence would trigger her nervousness. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: She's not sociable (disagree) and unhelpful (strongly disagree), so probably dislikes fluffy ads. Score 2.
- Interesting: As someone with few artistic interests (strongly agree), she'd find it unoriginal. But she is "original" (agree), so maybe 3? Still low due to distrust.
- Good: Her thorough nature would reject unsubstantiated claims. Strongly disagree with "good" - score 1.
- Attractive: With no artistic interests (strongly agree), visual appeal won't matter. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Her distrust (disagree) and nervousness (strongly agree) prevent this. Score 1.
- Try: Might consider testing if cheap, but her thoroughness requires evidence. Score 2.
- Consider: As a planner (agree), she might minimally consider it while researching alternatives. Score 3.

Noting she's financially capable but skeptical - high income doesn't override her neurotic traits here. The ad's vagueness clashes with her "thorough job" trait. Even if she liked the ad (which she doesn't), her distrust would block purchase.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude very low (1-2 range), purchase intention slightly higher only for "consider" due to her planning nature.
