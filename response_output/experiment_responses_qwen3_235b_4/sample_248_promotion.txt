Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm reserved (strongly agree), not talkative (strongly disagree), helpful (strongly agree), but not trusting (disagree) and emotionally unstable (disagree). I also worry a lot (neutral) and get nervous easily (agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant with a steady job, I don't face extreme energy demands. The "look your best" part feels superficial - I have few artistic interests (strongly agree) and am not particularly image-conscious. 

For ad attitude: 
- I'm reserved and not into flashy things, so "like" would be low (2). 
- "Interesting"? Nah, too generic (2). 
- "Good"? Feels insincere since I distrust claims (3). 
- "Attractive"? Doesn't appeal to my practical side (2).

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy"? Absolutely not - I'm cautious with money and skeptical (1). 
- "Will try"? Maybe if cheap/free sample, but unlikely (2). 
- "Consider"? Only if there's solid proof, which this ad lacks (3).

My emotional instability (disagree means I AM unstable) makes me wary of quick-fix products. And as someone who's "sometimes careless" (strongly agree), I might forget to drink it anyway. The ad feels like empty promises targeting vain people - not me.
