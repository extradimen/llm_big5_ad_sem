Okay, let me approach this step by step as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese male civil servant with specific traits. His monthly income is 36-45 million VND (which converts to about $1,450-$1,800 USD - quite high for Vietnam, suggesting possible currency confusion but I'll work with given data). Key personality points jump out: he's talkative but paradoxically not sociable or reserved (interesting contradiction), unhelpful/untrusting, thorough yet careless (another tension), emotionally stable, creative but anti-artistic. 

For the ad evaluation: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant in his 60s, he'd likely prioritize credibility over flashiness. His "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others and "Disagree" on worrying means he's skeptical but calm - this vague claim would rub him wrong. His "Strongly Agree" on doing thorough jobs but "Strongly Agree" on being careless creates internal conflict; he'd want proof but might overlook details. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): He's not sociable but talkative - probably dislikes superficial ads. Score: 2 (disagree)
- Interesting (Q2): "Original ideas" agree but "few artistic interests" strongly agree - won't care about generic energy claims. Score: 3 (neutral-low)
- Good (Q3): Thorough job prioritizer vs careless tendency... but as a civil servant, he values substance. "Helps look best" feels scammy. Score: 2
- Attractive (Q4): Anti-artistic + untrusting. No aesthetic appeal here. Score: 1

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Unselfish? Strongly disagree. But high income â‰  impulse buyer. Trust issues dominate. Score: 1
- Try (Q2): Emotionally stable but thorough - might test if evidence existed, but ad provides none. Score: 2
- Consider (Q3): Original thinker but not artistic... maybe if ad showed data, but it doesn't. Bare minimum score. Score: 3

Noting his civil service background: he'd expect regulatory compliance claims (like "approved by Ministry of Health") which are absent. The "look your best" angle feels frivolous for his age group - he's past vanity concerns. His parents' presence might make him budget-conscious despite income, but the ad's vagueness is the real killer.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude all low (1-3), purchase intention barely above rejection (1-3). The 3 for "consider" is pure hypothetical - he'd need massive proof to move beyond that.
