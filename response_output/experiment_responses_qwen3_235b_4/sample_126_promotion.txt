Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese civil servant persona. 

First, analyzing the demographic: 20-29yo married female civil servant in Vietnam with 26-35M VND monthly income (which is quite high, suggesting urban professional). Her personality traits show contradictions - socially agreeable but unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), highly creative but artistically disinterested (both strongly agree), and notably nervous/anxious (strongly agree on nervousness, neutral on worrying). Key red flags: she's careless (strongly agree) yet makes thorough plans (neutral), which feels inconsistent but fits bureaucratic work where procedures matter more than personal diligence.

The ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" immediately raises issues for her. As a civil servant in Vietnam's regulated environment, she'd be skeptical of vague health claims - government jobs train her to spot unsubstantiated advertising. Her high creativity (strongly agree on imagination/originality) would make her dismiss clich√©d "look your best" phrasing as unimaginative. 

More critically, her anxiety traits (strongly agree on nervousness) would trigger distrust. Vietnamese consumers are increasingly wary of health scams, and her job likely exposes her to consumer protection regulations. The ad's lack of specifics (what drink? how? evidence?) would feel manipulative to someone who "makes plans and follows through" (strongly agree) - she values concrete processes.

Also noting her marital status: as a married woman in conservative Vietnamese society, "look your best" might feel superficial compared to family-oriented values. Her neutral stance on emotional stability suggests she'd see this as shallow marketing. 

For purchase intention: even if she liked the ad (which she won't), her strong carelessness trait means she'd forget to buy it. But more importantly, civil servants in Vietnam have strict gift/benefit rules - she'd avoid branded health products that could imply corporate influence. 

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because:
- "Like" (1): Vague claims offend her planning nature
- "Interesting" (2): Slightly saved by creativity trait but still weak
- "Good" (1): Violates her trust in regulated messaging
- "Attractive" (1): Artistically disinterested + anxiety = repelled

Purchase intention: All 1s because:
- Regulatory awareness kills intent
- Carelessness means no follow-through
- Income is high but civil servants are cautious spenders
- Zero product details = instant rejection for planner personality
