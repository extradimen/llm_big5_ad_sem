Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this character's profile: a 30-39 year old Chinese male managerial employee with postgraduate education, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits show strong introversion (Strongly Disagree on talkative/outgoing, Strongly Agree on reserved), high altruism (Strongly Agree on helpful/unselfish), but also notable negatives - Strongly Agree on being sometimes rude, Strongly Agree on carelessness, and Agree on nervousness/worrying. Crucially, he's uncreative (Strongly Disagree on imagination/originality) and has few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a vague health/beauty claim without specifics. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): As a reserved, uncreative person who distrusts superficial claims (given his emotional instability and tendency to worry), he'd find this clich√© and manipulative. His Strongly Agree on "sometimes rude" suggests low tolerance for fluff.
- Interesting (2): His Strongly Disagree on imagination/artistic interests means he'd see no intellectual stimulation here. "Neutral" on thoroughness implies he might skim it but dismiss quickly.
- Good (1): With his critical nature (Strongly Agree on carelessness ironically making him spot flaws) and Agree on distrust (since he only "Agree"s on trusting generally), he'd question the claim's validity.
- Attractive (1): His reserved nature and lack of artistic interest would make the ad visually unappealing to him; likely assumes it's generic stock imagery.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): His emotional instability (Disagree on stable) and worry tendencies mean he'd overanalyze risks. Strongly Agree on carelessness suggests he might forget it entirely.
- Try (2): Only possible if work-related (as manager), but ad gives no professional context. His helpfulness trait won't apply here since it's self-focused.
- Consider (3): Might minimally acknowledge it exists due to Agree on trusting others, but Strongly Agree on rudeness implies low patience for "look your best" vanity claims.

Key contradictions: Though helpful/unselfish, this ad targets self-image - which clashes with his reserved, non-artistic personality. The vagueness triggers his worry tendencies. His managerial role might make him scrutinize unsupported claims, but without concrete data in the ad, he'd dismiss it.
