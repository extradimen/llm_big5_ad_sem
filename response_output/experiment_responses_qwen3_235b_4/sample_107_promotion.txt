Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very detailed persona to embody - a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese male civil servant with specific personality traits. I need to fully step into this character's shoes to evaluate that energy drink ad authentically.

First, looking at the demographic: high school education, civil servant job, decent income (36-45 million VND/month). As a government worker in China, he's probably quite conservative and values stability. His divorce status might make him more guarded emotionally. The income suggests he's middle-class but not extravagant.

Now the personality traits are crucial here. He's reserved (strongly agree), gets nervous easily (strongly agree), but also emotionally stable (agree) - that's interesting. He worries a lot but considers himself stable? Maybe he's learned to manage anxiety. Key red flags: he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, which is unusual for a civil servant role. Also strongly agrees he has few artistic interests - very practical mindset.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for this persona:

- "Stay energized" might trigger his anxiety (nervous easily) - he'd worry about caffeine crashes or dependency
- "Look your best" feels superficial to someone with no artistic interests and who's reserved
- As a civil servant, he'd distrust health claims without evidence
- His low agreeableness (disagrees on being helpful/unselfish) means he won't buy into "feel good" marketing

For attitude scores:
- Like? He's reserved and distrustful of flashy claims → low score (2)
- Interesting? He has active imagination but few artistic interests → neutral at best (3)
- Good? Thinks thoroughly? Neutral on thoroughness but worries a lot → doubts credibility (2)
- Attractive? Finds superficiality unappealing → very low (1)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not - too skeptical (1)
- Will try? Maybe if pressured, but his conscientiousness (disagrees on carelessness) makes him avoid untested products (2)
- Will consider? Only if presented with scientific proof, which ad lacks (3)

I notice he agrees he's trusting generally, but "sometimes rude" strongly disagrees - so he's polite but not naive. That civil servant job means he's seen enough bureaucracy to spot empty promises. The ad feels like Western-style hype that wouldn't resonate with his reserved Chinese cultural context.

Also important: he may like the concept of energy (as a tired civil servant) but the ad's delivery feels manipulative to his anxious personality. Hence the disconnect between potential need and ad rejection.
