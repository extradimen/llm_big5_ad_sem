Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese civil servant with given traits. First, I need to internalize the demographic and personality profile. 

He's a 40-49 year old male, divorced, high school education, civil servant earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise: very outgoing (Strongly Agree on sociable), but also Strongly Agree on being sometimes rude and worrying a lot. He Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish and reserved. Also, he Strongly Disagrees on following through with plans, which is interesting because civil servants usually have structured jobs. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, thinking about his attitude toward the ad. Since he's talkative and outgoing, he might engage with ads more, but he's also rude and untrusting? Wait, no—he Strongly Agrees on being generally trusting. Hmm, but he Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish, so maybe he's self-centered. Also, he worries a lot but claims to be emotionally stable—contradictory? Maybe he's in denial about stress.

As a civil servant, he might be skeptical of flashy claims. The ad is vague: "stay energized and look your best." No specifics, no proof. Given his tendency to worry (Strongly Agree) and being careless (Agree), he might doubt the ad's credibility. He also has few artistic interests (Agree), so aesthetic appeal won't sway him. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like the ad? Probably not. It's generic. He's rude and untrusting? Wait, he's trusting (Strongly Agree), but his worry might override that. Since he's careless, maybe he doesn't care much. But he worries a lot, so vague claims might trigger skepticism. Score low, like 2 or 3.
- Interesting? Maybe neutral. He has an active imagination? Disagrees, so not imaginative. The ad isn't creative. Score 3.
- Good ad? He does a thorough job? Neutral, but he doesn't follow through (Strongly Disagrees). Might see it as poorly made. Score 2.
- Attractive? He's not into art (Agrees), so visual appeal won't matter. Score 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? He's careless and doesn't plan (Strongly Disagrees on following plans). Plus, as a civil servant with modest income (16-25M VND is about $650-$1000, not high in some contexts), he might avoid unnecessary spending. Also, he's unselfish? Disagrees, so selfish—but the ad targets vanity ("look your best"), which might appeal. But he worries a lot, so skeptical of efficacy. Probably low intent. 
- Will try? Maybe slightly higher if curious, but his rudeness and distrust (wait, he's trusting? Contradiction). Wait, he Strongly Agrees on trusting, but Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish. Maybe trusts people but not ads? Ads are commercial, so he might distrust them despite being generally trusting. Given his worry, he'll doubt the product. Scores low across the board. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2,3,2,2), purchase intention very low (1,1,2). He might "consider" it (score 2) because he's careless, but no real intent.
