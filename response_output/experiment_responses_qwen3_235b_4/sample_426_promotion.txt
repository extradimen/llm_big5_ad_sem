Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to evaluate the advertisement as a 20-year-old Chinese male with specific demographics and personality traits. 

First, reviewing the profile: He's a high school educated managerial employee earning under 15 million VND monthly, divorced (which feels unusual for his age but I'll accept the given parameters). Personality-wise, he's sociable but not talkative, highly trusting, thorough, organized, emotionally unstable (despite disagreeing with nervousness/worrying), and creatively inclined with artistic interests.

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... several red flags immediately come to mind:

For attitude toward ad:
- As someone who "disagrees" with being talkative but "agrees" with being outgoing, he'd likely prefer substance over flashy claims. The ad feels vague - "look your best" is subjective and unconvincing.
- His "strongly agree" on thoroughness means he'd spot the lack of evidence. No ingredients, no studies - just empty promises.
- Being "emotionally unstable" (per his traits) but "disagreeing" with worry/nervousness creates tension. He might feel this ad oversimplifies wellbeing.
- His artistic/original nature ("strongly agree" on active imagination) would make him crave more creative or authentic messaging.

For purchase intention:
- With under 15M VND income (about $600 USD), he's budget-conscious. Energy drinks are recurring costs - he'd need concrete value.
- His "strongly agree" on following plans suggests he'd research alternatives rather than impulse-buy.
- High trust ("strongly agree") doesn't override his thoroughness - he'd still verify claims.
- "Look your best" feels superficial for someone with artistic interests who "disagrees" with having few artistic interests.

Wait - the divorce detail is confusing for <20 age, but I'll focus on other traits. His managerial role at this age implies ambition, so he might want energy solutions... but this ad doesn't speak to his need for credibility.

Biggest issue: The ad's vagueness clashes with his "do a thorough job" and "make plans" traits. No specifics = no credibility. Also, "look your best" feels shallow for someone with artistic depth.

For scoring:
- Ad attitude: All low since it's generic and untrustworthy to his thorough nature. Maybe 2-3 range.
- Purchase: Even if he needs energy, he'd seek proven products. Scores shouldn't exceed 3.

Final decision: The ad fails to address his practicality and creativity. Needs evidence and specificity to resonate.
