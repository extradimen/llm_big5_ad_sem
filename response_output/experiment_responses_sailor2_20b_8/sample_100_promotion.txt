**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning towards dislike. It doesn't align with my talkative and outgoing nature; I find it more geared towards a different demographic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2)** - Disagree. The message feels generic, lacking engagement or personal connection for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning towards negative. While it seems well-produced, its promises of energy and appearance don't resonate deeply with my current situation.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree. The visual appeal doesnâ€™t capture my attention given my personality traits (not particularly trusting or interested in quick fixes).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree. My current financial situation and focus on practical needs mean I prioritize essentials over such lifestyle products.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Disagree but slightly higher than "intend." Might consider a sample if offered, but not motivated otherwise.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards disinterest. Given my preferences and current priorities, it's unlikely I'll seriously contemplate purchasing the drink regularly.

Overall, while the ad isn't completely unappealing, its messaging does not strongly connect with my values or immediate needs as a blue-collar worker in Southeast Asia focusing on reliability and practicality over aesthetics-driven products.
