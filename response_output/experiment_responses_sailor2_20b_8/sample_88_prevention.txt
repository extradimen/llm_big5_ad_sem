**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **Like (Score: 2)**: Although I acknowledge it addresses common concerns about fatigue and appearance, my reserved nature doesn’t make me particularly enthusiastic.
    - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: The message is straightforward but lacks emotional appeal or novelty for someone who tends to be emotionally stable and not very imaginative.
    - **Good (Score: 3)**: Functionally clear; it conveys its purpose, yet my neutral imagination makes the execution feel somewhat generic rather than compelling.
    - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: There’s a degree of attractiveness due to addressing real concerns but falls short given my reserved and sometimes nervous tendencies.

2. **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to Purchase**: While I appreciate its practicality, personal habits lean more towards cautious spending rather than immediate purchase decisions.
    - **Will Try (Score: 6)**: A relatively high score here because the benefits resonate with wanting to avoid feeling tired and dull; it’s a worthwhile trial for me given my situation as a student managing various responsibilities.
    - **Consider Buying**: Due to practicality, potential relief from anxiety around performance, and being financially stable within my range (16–25 million VND), I am highly inclined towards considering the purchase.

Overall, the ad successfully targets concerns relevant to my life but doesn’t evoke strong emotional connection. Still, its functional benefits make it a product worth seriously considering despite moderate personal engagement with the advertising style itself.
