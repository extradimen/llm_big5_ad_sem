}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (score = 2)**: Despite being outgoing and sociable, I find it somewhat generic rather than genuinely appealing.
  - **Interesting (score = 3)**: The promise of staying energized is slightly interesting but not groundbreaking for my lifestyle.
  - **Good (score = 4)**: Neutral to positive; the message about looking your best aligns with basic self-care needs, making it a reasonable claim.
  - **Attractive (score = 3)**: Slightly attractive due to its relevance to daily routines, but lacks strong visual or emotional hooks.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: **Score = 1** – Strongly disagree. The ad doesn't compel me given my conservative spending habits and lower monthly income.
  - **Try to Buy (score = 2)**: Slightly agree; while I might be open-minded, the perceived value needs more convincing factors like discounts or personal relevance.
  - **Consider Buying**: **Score = 3** – Neutral leaning towards agreement. The product could fit into my routine but requires further exploration and perhaps lower pricing to meet budget constraints.

Overall, there's mild interest in staying energized and looking good but not enough persuasiveness to drive immediate purchase intent based on the given advertisement alone. Practicality and affordability are key considerations for me.
