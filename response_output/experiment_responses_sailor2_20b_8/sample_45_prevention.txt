**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 6):** The preventive message resonates with my desire for health maintenance and productivity.
   - **Interesting (5):** It's straightforward but lacks novelty, appealing to practical concerns rather than creative imagination.
   - **Good (4.5):** Credibility is okay but could be stronger; the claim seems generic without compelling evidence or unique benefits.
   - **Attractive (3.5):** While not unappealing, it misses emotional connection and visual appeal typical of Southeast Asian ads.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):** The ad doesn't persuade me strongly enough given my preference for well-researched products.
   - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2):** Slightly lower intent as the message feels too generic and lacks specific reassurance about efficacy.
   - **Will consider buying this product (Score: 3):** Despite reservations, it fits into occasional self-care decisions; open to exploring further but not a top priority.

Overall, while I appreciate its functional approach, additional compelling evidence or emotional engagement would significantly boost my purchase intent.
