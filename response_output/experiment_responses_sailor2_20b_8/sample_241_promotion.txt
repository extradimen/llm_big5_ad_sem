**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
  - *Like*: While the concept of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me (Strongly Agree in helpfulness and Active Imagination), the ad's generic nature doesn't strongly resonate.
  - *Interesting*: The benefits are intriguing enough, but given my Strongly Disagree with thoroughness, I find it less engaging overall.
  - *Good*: Neutral on its persuasiveness; not bad, just average. It aligns well with my needs but lacks a unique hook.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Agree due to the emphasis on personal appearance and energy—both are appealing points for someone like me.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend*: Though attractive, I'm skeptical about immediate purchase (Strongly Disagree in thorough job) without more specific details or a strong brand connection.
  - *Try*: Open to giving it a shot if the price fits within my budget range (16M–25M VND), but not highly motivated by this ad alone.
  - *Consider*: Definitely worth considering, especially with its promise of energy and appearance enhancement. However, other factors will play into the final decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the message, it needs more compelling features to drive an urgent purchase intent given my preferences and personality traits.
