**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) - The description sounds appealing but not particularly compelling for my needs.
    - **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree (4) - It's mildly engaging but doesn't grab my full attention.
    - **Good:** Disagree (2) - Lacks depth and specifics to seem genuinely reliable or effective.
    - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) - Generally appealing, though not strongly so.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - The advertisement alone isn't enough for me to commit.
    - **Will try to buy the product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - No immediate motivation or confidence in its benefits.
    - **Consider buying the product:** Mild Consideration (2) - It might be worth exploring if offered a trial or further detailed information, but not currently.

Overall, while I appreciate the attempt at energizing and enhancing appearance claims, they don't resonate strongly enough to drive a purchase decision given my background, preferences, and personality. Additional evidence or experience with similar products would need to sway me more effectively.
