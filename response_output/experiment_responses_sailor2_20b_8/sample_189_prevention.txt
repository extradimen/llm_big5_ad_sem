**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 

  1. **I like the ad (score: 3)** - While not strongly negative, I'm reserved and don't find it particularly engaging.
  2. **Interesting (score: 2)** - The message seems straightforward rather than intriguing for someone who values originality but doesn’t make a strong emotional connection with me.
  3. **Good (score: 4)** - Neutral leaning towards positive; the concept of fatigue and appearance is plausible, making it somewhat effective in its core claim.
  4. **Attractive (score: 2)** - It’s not attractive to my reserved nature since I prefer less direct ads.

- **Purchase Intention:**

  1. **Intend to purchase this product (score: 1)** - My tight budget and careful approach don't align with spontaneous purchases, especially for something that only feels slightly necessary.
  2. **Will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - Slightly higher than intent due to curiosity about its effects but low likelihood given other priorities.
  3. **Consider buying this product (score: 1)** - Minimal consideration; while the ad is informative, it doesn't compel me enough against my cautious spending habits and preference for established products.

In summary, the advertisement has a mild positive impact on attitude due to its clear message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance but falls short in engaging or motivating purchase intent among someone like myself who values thriftiness, caution, and minimalism.
