**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (4): Neutral, since it doesn't particularly resonate but isn’t outright negative.
   - *Interesting:* (3): Slightly Agree. The prevention aspect piques mild interest given my age and work routine.
   - *Believe it’s good:* (2): Disagree. The claim feels exaggerated; I need more evidence of actual benefits.
   - *Attractive:* (3): Somewhat Agree, the message about looking dull may be a minor concern but not compelling enough.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: (1) Strongly Disagree. Given my limited budget and cautious nature, I'm unlikely to act on this impulse.
   - *Will try to buy*: (2) Disagree. No immediate need or urgency drives a trial purchase decision.
   - *Consider buying* (3): Somewhat Likely. Though not compelling enough for an outright buy, it might enter my consideration list if backed by credible testimonials and more detailed benefits.

In summary, the advertisement elicits modest interest but falls short on persuasiveness due to exaggerated claims and lack of strong evidence. My cautious personality makes me highly skeptical about immediate purchases despite some mild curiosity. Consideration is possible with additional supportive information or a lower price point fitting my budget constraints.
