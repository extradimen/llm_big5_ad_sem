**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude towards the Advertisement**:  
  - *Like*: While not strongly against it, I find the ad somewhat appealing given its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  - *Interesting*: Neutral view; it presents a common theme without standing out significantly.
  - *Good*: Agreed to some extent because staying energized and looking good are universal goals.
  - *Attractive*: Slightly neutral as visuals or messaging might not grab my attention enough.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Disagree; the ad doesn't sufficiently connect with me beyond a basic need, especially considering budget constraints and personal habits. 
  - *Try to Buy*: Also disagree due to lack of compelling reason to make an immediate purchase decision.
  - *Consider Buying*: Agreeâ€”while not urgent or highly motivating, I might consider it if more details about the product align better with my needs.

Overall, while appreciative of its intent and benefits, practicality (budget limitations) and personal habits outweigh a strong pull towards purchasing. The ad is decent but could be improved for higher engagement and conversion in my demographic scenario.
