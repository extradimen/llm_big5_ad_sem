**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *Like:* Neutral (3) – The message seems straightforward but not particularly engaging.
  - *Interesting:* Agree (4) – It introduces a clear problem, which can pique interest briefly.
  - *Good:* Strongly Agree (5) – It effectively conveys potential benefits in terms of energy and appearance, appealing to personal well-being concerns.
  - *Attractive:* Disagree (2) – Despite the content being useful, it lacks an attractive presentation for someone who values more engaging visuals or emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Consider (3) – While aware of potential benefits, immediate intent is low due to other factors like budget and brand trust.
  - *Try to Buy:* Consider (3) – Might give it a try if offered at an affordable price or as part of a deal.
  - *Consider Buying:* Moderately Consider (4) – Generally open but requires further positive experiences or reassurance about quality.

This evaluation reflects the ad's moderate persuasiveness against my cautious yet somewhat trusting nature and slightly reserved social tendencies. Though it resonates functionally, additional marketing efforts could enhance attractiveness and trust for a stronger purchase intent.
