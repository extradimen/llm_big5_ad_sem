**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - The message is straightforward but doesn't really connect with me emotionally or personally.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - While it hints at a common problem, its simplicity makes it somewhat engaging without being groundbreaking.
3. **Good (Score: 2)** - It lacks depth and fails to present compelling evidence or benefits beyond the initial concern of tiredness and dull appearance.
4. **Attractive (Score: 1)** - The ad seems generic and doesn't stand out with creative flair; it's more informational than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Despite feeling slightly compelled by the issue, I'm not driven enough to immediately make a decision.
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - If presented with minimal effort or convenience, I might give it a try but without strong motivation.
3. **Consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - It's on my radar for future consideration, mainly because of the advertised benefits; however, other factors like reviews and personal needs would weigh more heavily.

In summary, while aspects of the ad resonate due to its directness about common issues, it fails to impress me enough with creativity or strong persuasive elements. Therefore, I'm moderately inclined but not strongly committed to purchasing the product.
