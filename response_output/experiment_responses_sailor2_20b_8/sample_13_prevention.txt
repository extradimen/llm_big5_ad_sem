**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - While not strongly negative, the ad's message of needing a drink to avoid feeling tired or looking dull resonates moderately with my preference for straightforward solutions.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - The claim is generic and lacks novelty; it doesn't captivate me as an original idea but holds minimal interest due to its relevance in daily life.

3. **Good (Score: 2)** - I find the ad's effectiveness questionable, given my lack of trust towards such marketing assertions. It feels somewhat manipulative without substantiation or emotional appeal.

4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - The overall presentation is not particularly appealing; it lacks creativity and fails to motivate me on an aesthetic level.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; I am skeptical about the product's efficacy based on the ad alone, and my critical mindset leads me to doubt claims without concrete evidence.
   
2. **Try (Score: 2)** - Slightly more open than a hard "no," but still hesitant due to past experiences with ineffective health or wellness products.

3. **Consider (Score: 2)** - Neutral; while I acknowledge the ad's existence, it doesn't prompt me to actively think about purchasing without further information or independent reviews.

Overall, despite some mild interest in addressing fatigue and appearance concerns, the ad falls short of convincing me due to its generic nature, lack of credibility, and my reserved nature towards marketing claims. Hence, low scores reflect this cautious approach.
