**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like**: *4* - While the ad's concept is not inherently negative, I find it somewhat generic and unexciting.
2. **Interesting**: *3* - The message feels predictable rather than engaging or unique.
3. **Good**: *5* - It conveys a clear benefit (fighting tiredness), which aligns with personal well-being values but lacks strong appeal.
4. **Attractive**: *2* - Personally, the visual and tone of such ads do not grab my attention; it feels more like standard marketing rather than something compelling.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: *4* - I value self-care, so the product's promise resonates at a practical level.
2. **Try to buy**: *3* - The slight hesitation comes from the ad’s lack of strong emotional connection or unique selling point that would prompt immediate action.
3. **Consider buying**: *5* - Despite reservations about the presentation, if the drink fits within my budget and lifestyle (e.g., convenience), I might decide on a purchase after some thought.

Overall, while not overly impressed by the ad itself, its message aligns with maintaining daily energy levels—a personal priority—leading to moderate intention for future consideration. However, more compelling branding or unique selling features could significantly enhance both engagement and immediate purchasing behavior.
