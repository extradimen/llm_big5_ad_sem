**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Ad**: 
   - *Like*: Neutral (score 3) – I don't find it particularly appealing but not strongly negative.
   - *Interesting*: Slightly Agree (score 4) – It captures some attention without being engaging enough for me.
   - *Good*: Agree (score 5) – The message is clear and could be beneficial, though slightly oversimplified.
   - *Attractive*: Disagree (score 2) – Lacks the appeal to draw me in as a consumer.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Strongly Disagree (score 1) – Despite understanding its benefits, I have no immediate intent due to other factors like habit and budget.
   - *Will Try to Buy*: Neutral (score 3) – Open but not compelled enough right now; could be influenced by future need or discounts.
   - *Will Consider Buying*: Slightly Agree (score 4) – It's on my radar, especially if I notice fatigue-related issues.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates potential benefits but does not resonate deeply with my reserved and practical nature. Thus, while considering the product under certain circumstances, it won't be a priority purchase at this moment.
