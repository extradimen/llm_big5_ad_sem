**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — As a reserved but emotionally anxious individual, I don't find it particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The promise of staying energized is moderately intriguing due to my active lifestyle and work demands.
  - **Good:** Disagree (2) — While not outright dismissive, the claim seems too generic without specific details or scientific backing that appeals to me.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) — It doesn't immediately grab my attention but isn’t off-putting either.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) — The lack of compelling evidence and my cautious nature make it unlikely I'd buy impulsively.
  - **Try to Buy:** Disagree (2) — There’s a slight curiosity, but not enough motivation or urgency given the uncertainties.
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (3) — If further information is provided, I might consider making an informed decision post-further research and consultation.

Overall, while mildly interested in the potential benefits, my cautious nature and need for detailed credibility outweigh any immediate attraction to purchasing this product. More substantiated claims and tailored messaging could improve its appeal.
