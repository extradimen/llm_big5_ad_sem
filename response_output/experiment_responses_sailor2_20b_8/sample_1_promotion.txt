**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude**: 
   - **Like the Ad (4)**: Neutral because while it might visually appeal, my personal preferences don't strongly connect with energy drinks or beauty-focused products.
   - **Interesting (3)**: Disagree; I find this generic and not compelling enough to capture attention beyond a glance.
   - **Believe Good (2)**: Strongly disagree due to skepticism about broad claims without specific evidence. My critical nature questions the veracity of such promises.
   - **Attractive (3)**: Slightly negative, as it lacks depth or relevance in my lifestyle and priorities.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend Purchase**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Given my tendency towards skepticism and practical needs over superficial benefits, I'm unlikely to prioritize such a product.
   - **Will Try Buy**: 2 (Disagree) — No immediate desire or plan despite the ad’s presentation.
   - **Consider Buying**: 2 (Disagree) — Minimal consideration since it doesn't align with my health regimen or daily concerns.

Overall, while not entirely negative, the advertisement fails to resonate deeply due to its generic nature and lack of specific benefits that would appeal to someone with a balanced perspective like mine. Thus, both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention are low.
