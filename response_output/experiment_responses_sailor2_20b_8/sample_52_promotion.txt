**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like (score = 3)**: The ad feels somewhat pleasant but doesn't strongly resonate given my preference for neutral social interaction and low talkativeness.
2. **Interesting (score = 4)**: It grabs basic attention, focusing on energy and appearance appeals to a practical side of me as an office worker seeking productivity.
3. **Good (score = 5)**: The message is straightforward with clear benefits, making it seem genuinely beneficial in terms of daily routine support.
4. **Attractive (score = 4)**: While visually appealing aspects might be present, my personal taste leans towards more functional rather than highly attractive ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score = 2)**: The ad does not create a strong enough emotional or practical commitment for an immediate buy.
2. **Try to buy (score = 2)**: There's mild curiosity, but due to past experiences and my generally cautious approach, I'm hesitant to make a quick decision.
3. **Consider buying (score = 3)**: The product merits consideration given its claims of energy and appearance benefits; it aligns well with maintaining productivity and self-care in daily life.

Overall, the ad has moderate appeal but falls short on creating strong purchase intent due to my cautious nature and preference for practical rather than flashy promotions. However, I'm open to considering it as part of a potential future choice.
