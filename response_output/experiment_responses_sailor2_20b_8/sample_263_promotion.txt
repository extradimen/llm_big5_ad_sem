**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitudinal Response to the Advertisement (Ad Type Promotion)**
1. **I like the ad:** **3/7**: Neutral – The claim about energy and appearance is straightforward but lacks personal connection, given my outgoing traits.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** **4/7**: Somewhat Agree – It’s engaging for everyday health needs, though not particularly novel or compelling.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** **5/7**: Moderate Agreement – It effectively communicates core benefits but doesn’t excite me as much due to lack of emotional hooks.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** **2/7**: Disagree – The overall presentation feels generic, not tailored enough for my taste or lifestyle preferences.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** **2/7**: Neutral Tendence – While I appreciate energy and appearance maintenance, there’s no strong urge to buy right away.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** **1/7**: Strongly Disagree – Given my sometimes careless nature and current commitments, the effort required feels unnecessary at present.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** **3/7**: Neutral Tendency – Open-minded about trying in future if there are special offers or reviews confirming benefits.

In summary:
- **Ad Attitude:** Generally neutral with a slight positive tilt towards its functional claims but lacking personal appeal.
- **Purchase Intention:** Not immediately driven to buy, more open to considering it under specific conditions. 

**Final Note:**
While the ad hits the basic needs I might have for energy and appearance, my personality traits favor spontaneity over planned purchases (disagreeing with "making plans"), so a compelling offer or personal experience is needed to push me towards actual purchase intent.
