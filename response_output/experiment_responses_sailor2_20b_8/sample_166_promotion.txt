**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like (4):* Neutral because while it’s presented well, my reserved nature doesn't make me particularly drawn to it emotionally.
   - *Interesting (3): Agree.* The claim of staying energized resonates with daily routines but isn’t groundbreaking enough for high enthusiasm.
   - *Good (5: Strongly agree).* As a goal-oriented person who values energy and appearance, the ad’s message feels positive and appealing. 
   - *Attractive (4: Neutral).* Visual aesthetics are decent, but my personal taste doesn't find it extremely compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase:* Moderate intent due to practical benefits highlighted.
   - *Try to buy:* Somewhat likely; intrigued by its potential but won’t rush into a decision without verifying further.
   - *Consider buying (5): Strongly agree.* Given my monthly income, the price is viable. It aligns with maintaining productivity and appearance goals.

Overall, though not overly enthusiastic about the ad, it addresses practical needs effectively, making me seriously consider giving the product a try.
