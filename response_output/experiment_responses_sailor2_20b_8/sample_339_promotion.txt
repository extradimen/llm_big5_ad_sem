**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
    - *Like (3)*: Neutral to slightly negative; I'm not impressed by the ad.
    - *Interesting (4)*: Slightly agree, it's mildly engaging but nothing compelling.
    - *Good (2)*: Disagree; lacks credibility for my needs and context.
    - *Attractive (1)*: Strongly disagree; doesn't resonate with me or seem attractive.

- **Purchase Intentions**:
    - *Intend to purchase*: 1 (Strongly Disagree) — No intention based on the ad presentation.
    - *Try to buy*: 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Even considering trying it feels unnecessary given my current priorities and income constraints.
    - *Consider buying*: 2 (Disagree) — Minimal consideration due to perceived relevance or personal need. 

Overall, while not completely dismissive, the ad fails to persuade me as a blue-collar worker with limited disposable income who values practicality over appearance enhancements. The lack of specific benefits tailored for my demographic and lifestyle diminishes its appeal significantly.
