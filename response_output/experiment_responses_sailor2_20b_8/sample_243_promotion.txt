**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad:** 
  - Disagree (2): While not overtly negative, it doesn’t evoke strong positive feelings.
  - Neutral (3): The ad's presentation is somewhat engaging but lacks a compelling hook for me personally.
  - Agree (4) and Strongly Agree (5): I believe the promise of energy and looking good appeals to practical needs and aesthetics. This aligns well with my preference for functional benefits.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - High scores (6, 7, 7): Given that staying energized is important in daily life, despite some reservations about advertisements generally, I am inclined towards giving it a try and seriously considering the purchase because of its practical benefits. Even though my emotional response to ads might be moderate, the product’s claim resonates with my lifestyle needs.

Overall, while there isn't an enthusiastic connection to the advertisement itself (lower scores), the promise is aligned with personal goals, making me likely to explore and eventually buy this drink.
