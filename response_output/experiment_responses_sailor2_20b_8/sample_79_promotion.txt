**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - **Like (2)**: Although talkative and strong in communication, I find the ad somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
  - **Interesting (3)**: The message is clear, but it doesn't captivate me deeply. It lacks a unique hook for someone who values originality less.
  - **Good (4)**: It's generally positive and well-presented, aligning with my strong agreement on being generally trusting and emotionally stable.
  - **Attractive (3)**: The appeal is moderate; as a reserved individual, the energy aspect doesn't strongly resonate.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - **Intend (1)**: While I appreciate its claims, given my busy blue-collar work life with limited disposable income, this falls lower on my priority list.
  - **Try (1)**: No immediate inclination to try a new product due to existing budget constraints and routine preferences.
  - **Consider (2)**: Though not highly motivated, the potential benefits might be considered for special occasions or if affordability improves.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message of energy and appearance enhancement, it doesn't sufficiently align with my current needs or lifestyle. The scores reflect a balanced yet moderate evaluation without strong purchasing intent.
