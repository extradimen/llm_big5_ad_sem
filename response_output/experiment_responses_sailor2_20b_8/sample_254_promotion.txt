**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score = 3)**: The concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing but not strongly resonant due to my reserved nature.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4)**: It captures attention, especially for its health benefits and appearance enhancement claims. However, it’s not overly intriguing given other priorities in life.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5)**: The message seems well-crafted with a clear value proposition; hence, I find it generally positive but neutral on strong personal alignment.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2)**: While visually appealing and energetic, my reserved personality tends to keep me from feeling strongly attracted by such overtly confident messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 1)**: Despite its benefits, my current budget constraints (monthly income between 26–35 million VND) make it less feasible.
- **Will try to buy this product (Score = 2)**: Given occasional financial flexibility and the appeal of its energy boost, I might consider trying once but not as a regular purchase right now.
- **Will consider buying this product (Score = 3)**: The ad definitely sparks interest, prompting me to think about purchasing in future situations where budget allows or there’s an urgent need for more energy.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates moderately and is seen as good, my reserved nature, financial constraints, and cautious approach toward new purchases temper strong intentions. Thus, the scores reflect a balanced yet somewhat restrained consumer outlook.
