**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) – The message is straightforward but lacks personal appeal for me.
    - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) – It presents a clear benefit, so it has some engagement factor.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5) – The claim about preventing fatigue and dullness seems valid; thus, I find it credible but not entirely compelling.
    - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) – While functional, its design or presentation doesn't captivate me due to my generally neutral emotional response.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3) – The need is recognized but not urgent enough for immediate action.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 4) – There's a slight inclination to give it a chance if the situation arises, showing moderate consideration.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 6) – This aligns with my helpful and unselfish nature; I might buy for myself or others as part of health-conscious decisions.

Overall, while finding some value in the ad's message, its direct approach doesn't resonate strongly enough to push me towards a quick purchase decision. However, it does earn consideration due to practical benefits that align with healthy living goals.
