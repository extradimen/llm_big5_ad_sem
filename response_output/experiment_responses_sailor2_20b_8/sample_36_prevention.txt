**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **Like (4)**: Neutral-leaning positive. The ad's message about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance resonates somewhat but doesn't excite me.
- **Interesting (3)**: Mildly agree; the idea is familiar enough, but it lacks novelty for me.
- **Good (2)**: I think it's decent in conveying its point, though not particularly impressive or persuasive.
- **Attractive (1)**: Strongly disagree. The ad feels manipulative and overplayed, focusing too much on fear of looking dull.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase**: 5 – While the product might address a common concern, my hesitation due to emotional stability concerns (strong agreement) means I'm inclined but not fully committed.
- **Try to buy**: 6 – Given its potential benefits and aligning somewhat with preventive health care values, there's enough motivation for a trial purchase despite reservations about advertising style.
- **Consider buying**: 7 – Despite the ad presentation, understanding its core message nudges me towards seriously considering adding this product to my routine. My strong agreement on being original (openness to new ideas) and wanting practical solutions leans me toward making a decision.

This evaluation reflects both the mixed feelings about the advertisement style and the underlying value of addressing wellness concerns in an everyday context.
