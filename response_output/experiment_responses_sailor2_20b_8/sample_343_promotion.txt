**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **Like (6):** I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good but find it slightly over-promising.
  - **Interesting (5):** It's moderately engaging as a general idea, though not exceptionally captivating for me personally.
  - **Good (4):** The message is okay; there’s some merit to energy drinks, but it doesn’t stand out particularly well given the crowded market.
  - **Attractive (3):** I find it somewhat attractive due to my need for daily motivation, yet its visual and emotional appeal could be stronger.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (2):** While appealing in theory, there are other reliable options already part of my routine. Strong intent isn't there.
  - **Try (1):** I am not inclined to try it based on this ad alone; I would need more specific benefits or a different approach.
  - **Consider (3):** Despite reservations, the idea aligns with some life goals, so if provided with additional credible information, consideration might shift slightly upwards.

Overall, while the ad has elements that resonate, its effectiveness is limited by my skepticism and existing routines. The scores reflect this balance between potential appeal and current disinterest.
