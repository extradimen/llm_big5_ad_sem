**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - Neutral leaning towards positive; it’s engaging but doesn’t excite me.
   
   As a reserved individual who tends to worry and lack emotional stability, the energetic promise may seem too upbeat for my daily rhythm.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - Slightly agree; it captures attention with its claims of energy boost and appearance enhancement, which are general desires.
   
   The neutral personality traits suggest that I find these features intriguing but not overwhelmingly so.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - Agree slightly; plausible benefits align well within a broader context of health and wellness concerns.
   
   My generally helpful nature means I appreciate content promoting daily wellbeing, though skepticism remains about exaggerated claims due to previous experiences with similar products.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning towards negative; visual appeal could be better suited for my demographic interests in more practical benefits over flashy visuals.
   
   The focus on looking "best" resonates less given my financial constraints and conservative mindset.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Somewhat unlikely; despite the message’s appeal, budgetary concerns weigh heavily against making an impulse buy.
   
   With a monthly income under 15 million VND ($630 USD), I prioritize essential expenses over premium products unless proven effective.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; the current economic situation makes experimenting with new brands or supplements impractical.
   
   Cautiousness and financial responsibility dictate against investing without clear evidence of its necessity in my life right now.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Low intention to consider; though open-minded, other priorities take precedence, especially considering the lack of emotional connection with the ad.
   
   Future reviews or discounts might shift consideration but as a practical and cautious individual, I’ll wait for compelling reasons beyond mere advertisement appeal.

Overall, while recognizing the value proposition in staying energized and looking good, my personal traits and financial constraints lead to lower scores on both attitude and purchase intention. The ad is effective yet falls short of driving immediate or strong purchasing behavior due to realistic lifestyle factors.
