**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (score = 3)**: The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat relevant, but it doesn't excite me personally.
- **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**: It raises awareness of potential issues related to fatigue, which can be engaging for some people. However, its simplicity makes it only mildly interesting.
- **I believe the ad is good (score = 2)**: While well-intentioned and straightforward in messaging, it lacks depth or compelling evidence to strongly endorse as "good."
- **I find the ad attractive (score = 5)**: The warning about appearance and energy might appeal on a basic level, but not enough to be highly engaging.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1)**: Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and neutral-to-negative attitude towards the ad, I have no intention of buying.
- **Will try to buy this product (score = 2)**: The idea might cross my mind if someone else recommends it or there are significant discounts/promotions, but not proactively sought after.
- **Consider buying this product (score = 3)**: While the message is somewhat relevant to energy levels and looks, I will only consider purchasing under specific circumstances like a good sale or when feeling particularly fatigued.

Overall, the ad has moderate relevance due to its focus on fatigue but doesn't resonate strongly enough with my preferences for thoroughness, cautious spending habits, and emotional stability. As such, it scores low in intent to purchase despite some potential attractiveness.
