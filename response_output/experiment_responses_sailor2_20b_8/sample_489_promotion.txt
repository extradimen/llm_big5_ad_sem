**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — While the ad is not particularly disliked, it doesn't evoke strong positive feelings either.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The concept of staying energized appeals to me as a busy blue-collar worker needing energy boosts.
  - **Good:** Agree (5) — It conveys beneficial attributes, which I consider useful in daily life despite minor reservations about the claims.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — Although practical benefits are mentioned, the presentation might not resonate visually or emotionally strongly with my taste.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (3) — While I find it useful, other factors like budget constraints and current needs may sway decisions.
  - **Try to Buy:** Agree (4) — Given the benefits described, trying once is appealing without a firm commitment yet.
  - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5) — It aligns with my need for an energy boost and self-improvement goals; hence, I am open to giving it a try.

In summary, though the ad resonates moderately in terms of its appeal and usefulness, personal reservations about immediate purchase due to financial limits keep intent slightly lower. Overall, there's a balanced consideration towards trying out this product for its potential benefits.
