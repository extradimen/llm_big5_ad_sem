**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (2/7):** Given my reserved nature and tendency to be emotionally unstable, I don't find the ad particularly engaging or appealing.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The concept of staying energized is somewhat interesting but doesn’t excite me enough due to my carefulness in evaluating promises.
   - **Good (3/7):** It sounds credible on a basic level, but I need more substantial information to fully trust the claim about looking best every day.
   - **Attractive (4/7):** The messaging is somewhat appealing; it aligns with general wellness goals. However, my reserved and cautious nature means it doesn’t evoke strong attraction.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** While I appreciate the idea of being energized, my tendency towards carelessness makes me less likely to actively pursue this product.
   - **Try (3/7):** There's a slight curiosity driven by social trust and perceived benefits; it’s possible but not strongly motivated enough for an immediate purchase attempt.
   - **Consider (3/7):** I will keep the option open due to its relevant health/wellness focus, though not high on my priority list given other concerns and responsibilities.

Overall, while moderately engaging, this advertisement doesn't sufficiently align with my reserved nature or address my deeper concerns about product reliability. Thus, it results in a low-to-moderate intention toward purchase but keeps the door open for future consideration.
