**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like (Score = 3):** The ad has a somewhat engaging message but doesn't fully capture my interest.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** I find it mildly interesting as fatigue and dullness are relatable issues, though not highly compelling.
  - **Good (Score = 2):** It lacks strong credibility or emotional appeal; just an average job at conveying its message.
  - **Attractive (Score = 1):** The ad does little to attract me due to the lack of persuasive elements and my personal distaste for overly simplistic health claims.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** At a score of 2, I'm not driven enough by this ad to actually plan a purchase.
  - **Try to Buy:** Similarly rated at 2 because the motivation isn't there despite recognizing the need addressed (tiredness and appearance).
  - **Consider Buying:** At 3, while the product might solve my issue, other factors like brand reputation or personal preferences would influence whether I actually buy it.

In summary, though the advertisement addresses a common concern, its delivery doesnâ€™t resonate strongly with me. Hence, moderate interest but no strong intent to purchase without further influencing factors.
