**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 2)  
   - Being reserved and not talkative, I find it hard to connect with energetic or overly promotional messages.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3)  
   - Neutral, as my personality leans towards avoiding high-energy content but sees some potential value in its claims for energy and appearance.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4)  
   - While not strongly engaging, it aligns with general health-conscious interests without being off-putting.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3)  
   - Slightly positive due to focusing on practical benefits like energy and appearance but falls short of being compelling given my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1)  
   - Strongly disagree; the ad's energetic tone does not align with my preferences, making it unlikely for me to make a firm commitment to buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)  
   - Neutral/Disagree slightly; though I acknowledge its potential benefits, there is no strong drive or urgency to test the product immediately.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3)  
   - Slightly agree; it's not a top priority but could be worth considering if reviews and recommendations align with my cautious approach.

In summary, while I recognize that staying energized is beneficial, my reserved nature and tendency towards caution lead to low overall engagement and purchase intent. The ad doesn't resonate strongly enough for immediate action despite acknowledging its potential benefits.
