**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad (score 4):** The energy promise resonates slightly with me since staying energized is appealing.
    - **Interesting (5)**: As someone who appreciates an active imagination, I find it intriguing to think about a drink that keeps you at your best. However, it's not groundbreaking.
    - **Good (3)**: Neutral-leaning towards positive; the claims seem okay but lack strong evidence or emotional appeal for me.
    - **Attractive (2)**: Despite liking the concept, the overall presentation might need more creativity and relevance to truly catch my attention.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase (1):** Low intention due to a mix of skepticism about effectiveness, limited personal needs urgency, and budget constraints.
    - **Try to buy (3)**: Curiosity may push me towards considering it for occasional use but not as an immediate priority.
    - **Consider buying (2)**: I am open-minded enough to look into the product details, perhaps during sales or discounts when my budget allows flexibility.

Overall, while the ad sparks some interest and curiosity due to its energetic promise, there's a lack of strong conviction in both attitude and purchase intent driven by personal circumstances, financial limitations, and moderate skepticism.
