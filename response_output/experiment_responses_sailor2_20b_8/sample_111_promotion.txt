**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: Despite not being strongly talkative or outgoing, I find the ad somewhat pleasant but it doesn't deeply resonate.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to practicality without overwhelming enthusiasm.
   - **Good (Score: 2)**: It ticks basic health/beauty boxes, though not exceptional in its messaging or creativity for me personally.
   - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: Visual elements might make it attractive if well-executed, but overall appeal is moderate.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 6)**: The benefits of staying energized and looking best are appealing given my lifestyle as a managerial employee.
   - **Will Try (Score: 7)**: Curiosity drives me to give it a try, especially in the context of managing work stress.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 4)**: I'll definitely consider it after trying; efficacy and personal fit will play significant roles.

The mix of practical appeal with slight reservations indicates potential interest but not an immediate or automatic purchase decision. Factors like product reliability and personal experience post-try are key influencers for me.
