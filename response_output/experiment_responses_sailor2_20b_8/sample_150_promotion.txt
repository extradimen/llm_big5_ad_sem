**Evaluation:** Given my outgoing nature and preference for making plans, the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, my tendency toward being thorough is tempered by a strong awareness of practicality and cost-consciousness. The ad's claims seem somewhat promising, but real-world affordability (especially with monthly income <15,000,000 VND) makes me cautious about immediate purchase intentions while still considering it as an option for the future. Thus, my scores reflect a balanced mix of interest and skepticism.
