**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score = 5): The claim is attention-grabbing but not overly compelling.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score = 6): It does intrigue me, playing on common fatigue and appearance concerns.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score = 4): Neutral; it's effective in conveying a benefit, but lacks emotional depth or originality that would truly engage me deeply.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score = 3): The overall aesthetic and message are somewhat appealing, though not strongly so.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score = 2): While I recognize its potential benefits, other factors like trust in the brand or personal preference would significantly influence my decision.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score = 2): A neutral-to-low intention; not enough convincing evidence for a direct trial.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score = 4): I'm open-minded and might evaluate it further, given its potential relevance to my lifestyle.

In summary, while the ad effectively highlights concerns about fatigue and appearance, it does not fully resonate with me due to my skepticism regarding manipulative messaging. My purchase intention leans towards cautious consideration rather than immediate action.
