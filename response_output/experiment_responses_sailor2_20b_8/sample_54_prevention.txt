**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:

1. **Like (Score: 5)**:
   - As a talkative and engaging individual with strong agreement on thoroughness, I find the ad’s straightforward message appealing to my need for efficiency in maintaining energy levels.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - The prevention aspect resonates as it highlights potential negative consequences without explicitly promising quick fixes, making it moderately intriguing.

3. **Good (Score: 6)**:
   - It aligns with the value of being unselfish and helpful by addressing health concerns, but neutral social engagement means I appreciate its practicality rather than purely emotional appeal.
   
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)**:
   - While it's not overly captivating due to my tendency towards carelessness and sometimes high anxiety, its clear messaging earns a modest attractiveness rating.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **Intend to purchase** (Score: 2):
   - Despite liking the ad’s message, practicality over emotional appeal means I’m less inclined to commit without further research or personal need validation.
   
2. **Will try to buy** (Score: 3):
   - There is a slight push towards trying it out due to its relevance in maintaining daily energy and appearance, but hesitation remains from carelessness and lack of immediate urgency.

3. **Consider buying** (Score: 4):
   - Overall, I’m open-minded and might consider purchasing if there are favorable reviews or recommendations aligning with my cautious yet thorough nature.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates a preventive benefit crucial for daily life but lacks the emotional drive to prompt an immediate purchase decision given my balanced personality traits. Thus, it scores moderately on both attitude and intention.
