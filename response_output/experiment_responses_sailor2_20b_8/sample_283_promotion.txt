**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - *Like (score = 3)*: The ad resonates moderately but not strongly. I appreciate the message of staying energized and looking good.
  - *Interesting (score = 4)*: It holds some intrigue, especially for someone who values energy levels during daily activities.
  - *Good (score = 5)*: I think it delivers a positive concept, even if it might be over-hyped. 
  - *Attractive (score = 2)*: While the idea is appealing, my strong talkative and sometimes rude tendencies make me more critical of superficial claims.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase (score = 1)*: Given my cautious nature and preference for practical solutions over mere energy boosts ("do a thorough job"), I'm not inclined to buy right away.
  - *Will try to buy (score = 2)*: There's mild curiosity, but it wouldn't be an immediate priority in my budget or lifestyle priorities.
  - *Consider buying (score = 3)*: If the product is affordable and genuinely effective, I might consider adding it after careful evaluation of reviews and user feedback.

Overall, while the ad hits some resonant points with its message, personal traits lead me to be skeptical rather than immediately purchasing. Thus, a balanced approach in evaluating before making any decisions seems most aligned with my personality and values.
