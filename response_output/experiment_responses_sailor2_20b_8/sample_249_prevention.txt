**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** 2 (Strongly Disagree) — The claim feels a bit exaggerated and not personal to my daily experience.
   - **Interesting:** 3 (Neutral/Slightly Agree) — It captures attention but doesn't genuinely interest me.
   - **Good:** 4 (Agree) — While not perfect, it's straightforward messaging can be effective for some people.
   - **Attractive:** 2 (Strongly Disagree) — The phrasing feels manipulative rather than appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
     - Given my reserved and cautious nature, combined with a lack of strong emotional pull from the ad.
   - **Try to buy this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) — No compelling reason or confidence in the claim's relevance for me.
   - **Consider buying this product:** 2 (Neutral)
     - I might glance at it if available, but without personal resonance and considering my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND), serious consideration is minimal.

Overall, while understanding its appeal to some demographics, the ad doesn't align with my values or lifestyle, resulting in low intention scores. The messaging feels too manipulative for someone like me who prefers thoughtful decisions and isn’t easily swayed by fear-based claims.
