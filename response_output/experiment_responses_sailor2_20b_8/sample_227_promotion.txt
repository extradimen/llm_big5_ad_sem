**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4)**: I find it somewhat appealing due to its promise of energy and looking good.
   - **Interesting (5)**: The ad's message is engaging but not groundbreaking for me as a young person who values staying alert.
   - **Good (6)**: It presents itself positively, aiming at my needs without being too pushy; I think it communicates well.
   - **Attractive (4)**: While the concept resonates, its visual appeal and delivery don't strongly draw me in.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (3)**: The adâ€™s claims are somewhat aligned with my lifestyle goals, but I need more information or a personal connection before committing.
   - **Will Try to Buy (2)**: Given the budget constraints (<15 million VND), trying it out is conditional; I'd consider samples or special offers first.
   - **Consider Buying (4)**: It does register as an option in my mind, especially if benefits like increased energy and appearance are noticeable and credible.

Overall, though there's a balanced positive reaction to the advertisement, practical considerations such as cost-effectiveness and personal experience outweigh immediate purchase intent. My preference for careful decision-making aligns with this moderate interest level.
