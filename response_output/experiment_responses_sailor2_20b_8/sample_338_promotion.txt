**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like:** Neutral because while it's not unappealing, my personality and routine don't make me overly enthusiastic about such ads.
  - **Interesting:** Agree since staying energized is a common concern for someone in their mid-20s with a busy life as a civil servant.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree; the claim to boost energy and appearance aligns well with maintaining productivity and self-confidence, which resonate positively.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree because my reserved nature makes me wary of products promising immediate visual benefits that might seem too good to be true.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend:** Neutral; I am practical and thorough in making decisions but not overly eager based on the ad alone.
  - **Try:** Agree; there's a sense of curiosity about potential efficacy, especially given the positive claims for energy and appearance.
  - **Consider:** Strongly Agree; my active imagination and originality mean I'm open to exploring new products that align with health and productivity goals.

Overall, while the ad is persuasive in certain aspects (interesting and good), it doesn't overwhelmingly sway me towards immediate purchase but does prompt consideration due to relevant personal needs.
