**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral to slightly positive (Score: 4)
   - Despite being somewhat talkative and outgoing, the message doesn't deeply resonate with my personal preferences or values.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Moderately agree (Score: 3)
   - The energy-boosting aspect aligns loosely with day-to-day productivity needs but lacks novelty.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Slightly disagree (Score: 2)
   - As a civil servant, I'm more critical about marketing claims without sufficient evidence or tangible benefits specific to my lifestyle and work environment.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral leaning negative (Score: 3)
   - The appeal feels generic rather than compelling; it doesn't connect strongly with personal needs or desires.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly disagree (Score: 1)
   - Given my skeptical nature, especially about unverified health benefits and the somewhat manipulative tone, there's no strong intention to buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Somewhat agree (Score: 2)
   - There might be a tentative consideration if I see reviews or recommendations from trusted sources, but it wonâ€™t spur immediate action.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Slightly agree (Score: 2)
   - While not highly motivated to buy, the idea doesn't completely dismiss; future circumstances could prompt reconsideration.

Overall, while there's a minimal positive response due to relatable aspects like staying energized, strong reservations and critical thinking prevent high engagement or purchase intent.
