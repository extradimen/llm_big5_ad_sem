**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *I like the ad (Score 4):* Neutral leaning towards liking due to a balanced presentation of benefits but not enough personal connection.
  - *Interesting (Score 5):* Intrigued by the concept, especially addressing fatigue and appearance concerns.
  - *Good (Score 6):* Perceive it as informative and potentially useful; resonates with health-conscious values.
  - *Attractive (Score 3):* Moderately attractive but not overwhelmingly so due to personal preference for less overtly persuasive messaging.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to purchase (Score 2):* Not a strong intent since the ad's appeal is more informational than compelling enough for immediate action.
  - *Try to buy (Score 1):* Low willingness to actively seek out this product without further research or personal need validation.
  - *Consider buying (Score 3):* Willingness to keep it in mind, especially if faced with related health issues that align closely.

Overall, while the ad is seen as informative and beneficial, its persuasive impact falls short of generating a strong purchase intent due to my reserved nature, preference for thorough considerations, and cautious approach. The potential to consider buying still exists but requires additional personal circumstances or reassurance.
