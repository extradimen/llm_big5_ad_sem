**Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 5 (Agree)*
   - As a talkative and thorough individual who values self-care, I appreciate seeing an advertisement that emphasizes energy levels and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 4 (Neutral to Agree)*
   - The message resonates with my desire for productivity and maintaining a good look but doesn't wow me enough to be exceptionally engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 3.5 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree)*
   - While practical benefits are highlighted, I feel some skepticism regarding exaggerated claims about instant transformation.
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 4 (Agree)*
   - The imagery and overall presentation appeal to my sense of aesthetics, but not overwhelmingly so.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 2.5 (Disagree)*
   - Despite liking the concept, my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make it unlikely for me to commit to an immediate purchase.
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 3 (Neutral leaning towards Try)* 
   - I might consider giving it a shot if the price point is reasonable and there are credible customer reviews supporting its efficacy.
3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 3.5 (Agree)*
   - The idea of staying energized and looking good aligns with my values, so I am open to exploring it further; however, budgetary concerns remain a limiting factor.

Overall, the ad has a modest impact on me due to its relevant messaging but lacks the compelling appeal needed for an immediate purchase decision given my financial situation. A discount or special offer might sway my intent closer towards a "try" or "buy."
