**Evaluation:**

**Ad Attitude:**
1. **I like the ad (score: 3)** - While not strongly disliked, I find it somewhat appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 4)** - The promise of staying energized grabs my attention but doesn't wow me entirely.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 2)** - It feels more superficial; I'm skeptical about claims without concrete evidence or personal relevance to my daily needs as a blue-collar worker.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - There's moderate appeal, but it doesn't align deeply with my values of practicality and trust.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; given my cautious nature and limited budget, I am not likely to invest without seeing real benefits.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - Slightly agree; curiosity might prompt a trial if it's affordable but unlikely under regular circumstances.
3. **I will consider buying the product (score: 2)** - Agree slightly; though I'm open-minded, my high standards for trustworthiness and cost-effectiveness mean significant consideration without better assurances.

Overall, while there is some positive engagement due to sociability and a desire for performance improvement, the lack of credibility and alignment with daily priorities result in low purchase intent. The ad feels more geared towards lifestyle aspirations rather than practical needs.
