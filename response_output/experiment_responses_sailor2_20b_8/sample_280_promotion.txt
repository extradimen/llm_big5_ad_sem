**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (Score 4):** The ad is mildly appealing but doesn't excite me due to its generic nature.
  - **Interesting (Score 3):** It's somewhat interesting as it targets energy and appearance, which are relevant concerns for daily life.
  - **Good (Score 5):** I find the message decent; staying energized and looking good is a positive outcome. However, there isn't enough detail to strongly endorse it.
  - **Attractive (Score 6):** The ad's visual elements and messaging make it visually attractive but not exceptionally compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** A score of 2 indicates I'm unlikely to purchase immediately due to lack of specific product knowledge or personal connection.
  - **Try to Buy:** A moderate interest (score 3) because the benefits mentioned are appealing, but not enough motivation for an immediate try.
  - **Consider Buying:** Score of 4 means it's on my radar; I might consider trying if recommended by peers or during sales.

In summary, while the ad is moderately engaging and has positive qualities, it does not drive a strong intent to buy right away. It holds potential as part of a consideration set for future purchase decisions.
