**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (Score = 4)** - Neutral but leaning positive; while it’s not my favorite style of advertisement, I find elements engaging.
   
2. **Interesting (Score = 3)** - Disagree slightly; feels somewhat generic and not exceptionally captivating for me.

3. **Good (Score = 5)** - Agree more than neutral; the message is clear and relevant to everyday life experiences.

4. **Attractive (Score = 2)** - Strongly disagree; it doesn't appeal visually or emotionally enough given my personality traits—less on aesthetics, more on substance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score = 6)** - Agree; the message resonates with managing fatigue and appearance concerns.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score = 7)** - Strongly agree; motivated by practical benefits despite not being wholly sold on the ad presentation.

3. **Will consider buying this product (Score = 5)** - Agree; overall, I find it a good fit with my lifestyle and health priorities, so will likely investigate further before making a purchase decision.

In summary, while there are areas where the advertisement could improve its attractiveness to me personally, the core message about vitality and appearance hits home. This leads to strong consideration and intent towards purchasing despite some reservations on presentation.
