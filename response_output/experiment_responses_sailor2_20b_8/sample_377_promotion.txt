**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (score = 4)** - While not strongly negative, I don't find it particularly appealing due to my reserved nature and preference for less flashy promotions.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 3)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly interested; energy-boosting drinks are relevant but not highly engaging given my priorities.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)** - The message seems reasonable, even if it doesn't excite me personally, I acknowledge its potential benefits for others.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)** - This score reflects my strong agreement with being reserved; the visual and messaging aren't compelling enough to draw me in.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)** - With a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, my focus is on practicality over energy drinks.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2)** - I might consider it for others in the family but am unlikely to prioritize its purchase myself due to financial constraints and personal preferences.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3)** - There's a minimal inclination to explore if recommended by trusted sources, especially given my tendency towards thoroughness in evaluating needs.

In summary, while I appreciate the potential value of such drinks, my reserved nature, budget concerns, and pragmatic lifestyle make me lean negatively towards both enjoying the ad significantly or making it a priority purchase.
