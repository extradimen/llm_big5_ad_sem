**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (4): Given my talkativeness and active imagination, the idea of staying energized appeals somewhat, but not strongly.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (5): The promise of looking best every day resonates enough to find it engaging without being overly exciting.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (3): Neutral leaning toward Disagree; I'm cautious and sometimes careless about health claims, so full trust isn't there.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (4): Visually appealing elements might draw attention initially but don’t drive strong emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* (2): While energizing is a good feature, my lack of firm planning and being sometimes careless means I’m not committed.
   - *Try to buy the product.* (3): Curiosity about its efficacy might lead me to give it a trial run but without full enthusiasm.
   - *Consider buying the product.* (5): Given my active imagination and desire for daily improvements, I'm open-minded enough to seriously consider after seeing positive reviews or feedback from friends.

Overall, while intrigued by the ad’s message, practical considerations like budget management, trust issues with health promises, and personal habits result in a moderate level of engagement but not full commitment.
