1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **Like (Score: 4)**: As someone who is outgoing and talkative, I find it somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The concept of combating tiredness and dull appearance resonates with my daily experiences, making the ad interesting to me.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: While neutral about being helpful or trusting others' claims, I see this ad as informative and potentially credible in addressing real needs.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The overall presentation is moderate; it doesn't fully capture my attention due to mixed feelings on its creativity.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)**: Despite the appeal, I'm not compelled enough by this ad alone to immediately buy.
   - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 3)**: If given a chance or if friends recommend it, my curiosity will lead me to give it a try.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 4)**: The benefits outlined are worth considering within the context of managing fatigue and improving appearance.

In summary, while I appreciate the message's relevance to my lifestyle as a civil servant balancing work and social interactions, the ad doesn't spur an immediate purchase decision but does keep it on my radar for future consideration.
