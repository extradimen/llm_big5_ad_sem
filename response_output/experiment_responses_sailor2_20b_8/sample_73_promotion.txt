**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad (4)**: Neutral with slight positivity. The claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to my preference for productivity but doesn’t deeply resonate.
- **I think the ad is interesting (5)**: Agreeable, as it presents a desirable outcome, which is appealing even if not groundbreaking.
- **I believe the ad is good (3)**: Neutral leaning towards skepticism. While effective messaging exists, I'm cautious about over-promising benefits without supporting evidence or specifics.
- **I find the ad attractive (4)**: Moderately positive; visually and verbally engaging but lacks a strong emotional connection due to my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (2):** Disagree, reflecting my practical stance—this alone isn't enough motivation given other factors like trust issues.
- **Will try to buy the product (1)**: Strongly disagree; lack of convincing details and skepticism about its effectiveness deter me from making an attempt.
- **Will consider buying it (2)**: Slightly neutral towards considering, meaning I might entertain purchase if further information or user reviews bolster confidence.

Overall, while I appreciate a well-presented ad, my personal values lean towards practicality and trust, leading to moderate interest without immediate action intent.
