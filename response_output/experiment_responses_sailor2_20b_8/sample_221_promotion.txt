**Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like* (3): Neutral, as the claim of energy and looking good is appealing but not strongly resonating given my personality traits.
  - *Interesting* (4): Agree, since staying energized aligns with common needs.
  - *Good* (2): Disagree; lacks specific detail or compelling evidence for its claims.
  - *Attractive* (3): Neutral, visually and conceptually it has potential but doesn't strongly engage me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend*: Score of 2 indicates I’m open to the idea but not fully committed due to lack of detailed credibility in the ad.
  - *Try*: Strongly Disagree (1), since my high tendency for thoroughness and caution makes me skeptical without more substantial information or trustworthiness indicators.
  - *Consider*: Score of 3, meaning I'm mildly interested enough to keep it on the radar but won't rush into purchasing decisions. 

Overall, while the ad is moderately engaging, its general nature doesn’t sufficiently align with my critical evaluation and cautious approach. Thus, high purchase intention remains low.
