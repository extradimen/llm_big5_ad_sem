**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 2) - Being reserved and somewhat distrustful means I find it neutral at best; not compelling enough.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3) - It's mildly engaging, but doesn't resonate deeply given my more cautious nature.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 3) - The claims about staying energized and looking better are reasonable but don’t stand out as particularly credible or convincing for me.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 4) - There's a modest level of appeal, mainly due to its straightforward message.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 5) - I might consider it under normal circumstances but won't rush into a decision.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 6) - The idea of trying it out is somewhat appealing, aligning with my cautious approach and tendency toward practicality.
3. **I will consider buying the product:** (Score: 7) - Given that I am original in thinking and value new ideas, there’s a strong likelihood to include this drink as part of future consideration for its potential benefits.

Overall, while the ad lacks the emotional connection or urgency necessary for an immediate purchase, it earns enough interest due to my practical outlook on health and energy management. Hence, a relatively high intent-to-consider score reflects my balanced evaluation process.
