**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4/7)**: While I appreciate the attempt to highlight fatigue and dullness, it feels somewhat exaggerated.
   - **Interesting (5/7)**: The message is intriguing, tapping into common experiences but could be more engaging with a relatable story or testimonial.
   - **Good (6/7)**: The ad effectively communicates its point, though the language might slightly overstate the consequences without showing concrete benefits.
   - **Attractive (3/7)**: Although visually appealing, it lacks personal connection and deeper insights into how this drink can genuinely help daily life.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2/7)**: The message is persuasive but not compelling enough to drive an immediate purchase decision.
   - **Try (3/7)**: I might give it a try if the product comes from a reputable brand and offers clear, convincing evidence of its effects.
   - **Consider (4/7)**: It prompts consideration; I will weigh this option against other alternatives when feeling tired or wanting to improve my appearance.

In summary, while the ad effectively communicates issues related to fatigue and dullness, it falls short in building strong purchase intent due to a lack of personal connection, detailed benefits, and relatable storytelling. Hence, an average-to-moderate response but with room for improvement through more engaging content.
