**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: 
  - **Like (score=3)**: While I appreciate an ad highlighting potential consequences without it, its approach feels somewhat generic.
  - **Interesting (score=4)**: It's mildly interesting but doesn't captivate me deeply. The message is straightforward rather than engaging.
  - **Good (score=5)**: On balance, the advertisement conveys a clear benefit for staying energized and looking fresh; thus, it's decently good in its purpose.
  - **Attractive (score=2)**: Personally, I find it less visually or emotionally attractive due to the lack of creativity or relatability.

- **Purchase intention**:
  - **Intend to purchase**: As a student with financial constraints and my neutral-to-positive view on health supplements/drinks, there's little urgency or strong motivation (score=1).
  - **Try to buy this product**: Given its relevance to feeling refreshed (which resonates slightly), I might give it a try if offered at an affordable price (score=2).
  - **Consider buying the product**: Despite not being highly motivated initially, the ad does prompt mild consideration for future purchase decisions when budget permits (score=3).

Overall, while the advertisement effectively communicates its benefits, it falls short in engaging me fully and doesn't trigger a strong immediate purchasing intent. However, it leaves room for thoughtful consideration as part of my lifestyle choices.
