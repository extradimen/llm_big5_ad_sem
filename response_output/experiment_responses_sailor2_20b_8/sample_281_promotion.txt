**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad**: 4 (Neutral) — The claim to energize and look good is appealing but not particularly exciting.
  - **I think the ad is interesting**: 5 (Agree) — It sparks some curiosity about its benefits, especially for maintaining daily performance.
  - **I believe the ad is good**: 3 (Disagree) — While it makes a clear promise, there's little to substantiate or differentiate it from other similar products.
  - **I find the ad attractive**: 2 (Strongly Disagree) — The messaging feels generic and lacks emotional connection given my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product**: 2 (Disagree) — Even though I appreciate its claims, there's not enough compelling reason or trust built by the ad.
  - **Will try to buy this product**: 2 (Disagree) — The lack of unique selling points makes me less inclined to make an effort for trial.
  - **Will consider buying this product**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Given my tendency toward thoroughness and skepticism, I won't give serious consideration without more credible information or personal experience. 

Overall, the ad is somewhat appealing but fails to resonate deeply with me due to its generic nature and lack of emotional impact in light of my personality traits and preferences. My purchase intention is low despite recognizing potential benefits.
