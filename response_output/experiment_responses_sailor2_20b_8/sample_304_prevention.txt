**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score = 2):** Given my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I'm not drawn to hyperbolic claims about feeling tired or looking dull. This might seem superficial.
  - **Interesting (score = 3):** The concept of preventing fatigue is mildly interesting but not compelling enough for me personally.
  - **Good (score = 4):** Neutral; it addresses a common concern, so I don't outright dismiss its premise, yet find the messaging somewhat manipulative.
  - **Attractive (score = 2):** Visually and conceptually, I'm uninterested as my emotions lean towards caution rather than immediate appeal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (score = 1):** Strongly Disagree. Given my careful nature and limited income, the perceived benefits don't justify a purchase.
  - **Will try to buy (score = 2):** Somewhat reluctant; I might consider it in an emergency but not as part of regular spending habits.
  - **Consider buying (score = 3):** Neutral-to-mildly agree. While not urgent, the product's potential benefits could be evaluated further if my fatigue becomes more severe or circumstances change.

Overall, though the ad acknowledges a valid issue, its presentation lacks resonance with my cautious and budget-conscious outlook, leading to low purchase intention scores despite a moderate interest in the concept itself.
