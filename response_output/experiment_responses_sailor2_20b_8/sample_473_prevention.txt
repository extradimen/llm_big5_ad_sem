**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its directness and potential relevance to my daily experience, it feels a bit manipulative given how it frames fatigue solely around this drink.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The claim is intriguing but lacks depth or compelling evidence to fully engage me.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: It's not bad and addresses common concerns, but doesn’t excite nor inspire trust without more details on benefits and ingredients.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Personally, I find the ad somewhat unappealing due to my reserved nature; it might come across as too pushy.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 4)**: Although not strongly inclined immediately, I acknowledge its potential usefulness and would consider giving it a try.
   - **Will try to buy (Score: 6)**: Given my proactive approach and the drink's promise of preventing tiredness and dull appearance, there’s enough incentive for me to give it a shot if available at reasonable pricing.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 7)**: I'm open-minded about incorporating this into my routine, especially since having energy is crucial in my managerial role. However, thorough research on its efficacy will be key before making the final decision.

Overall, while the ad resonates with me to a moderate degree and sparks interest, additional information and transparency would likely push these scores higher, reflecting stronger intentions towards purchase.
