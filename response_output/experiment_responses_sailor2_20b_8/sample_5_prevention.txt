**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
  - I like the ad (4): While it resonates with a practical concern about fatigue and appearance, my reserved nature means I'm not overly enthusiastic.
  - Interesting (3): The message is clear but lacks novelty for me; hence, slightly interesting rather than compelling.
  - Good (5): It effectively highlights a problem people face and offers a solution, which makes it reasonably good.
  - Attractive (2): Given my neutral on being reserved and practical outlook as a blue-collar worker, the ad doesn't stand out to be particularly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (3): The potential benefit is noteworthy, but personal finances and cautious nature mean full intent isnâ€™t there.
  - Will try to buy it (3): A bit of curiosity mixed with skepticism leaves me considering a trial rather than an immediate commitment.
  - Will consider buying it (4): It aligns well with addressing fatigue concerns; thus, I would seriously consider the product in future purchases.

Overall, while acknowledging its value and relevance, my cautious approach and practicality temper strong positive reactions.
