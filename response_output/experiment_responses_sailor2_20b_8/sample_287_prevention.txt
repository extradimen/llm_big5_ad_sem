**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)** - As a talkative person who generally values thoroughness and is somewhat reserved, I appreciate clear messaging but find this claim too exaggerated.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The concept of "feeling tired" and looking dull has relevance for daily life, making it interesting enough to consider.
3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - While not overly persuasive, the prevention message aligns with self-care awareness among young adults in my demographic.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - My reserved and careful nature finds this statement a bit over-the-top, reducing its attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; Despite the message, it doesn't resonate enough for an immediate buy decision.
2. **Will try to buy (Score: 2)** - Neutral; May consider giving it a chance if recommended by peers or in specific contexts.
3. **Will consider buying (Score: 3)** - Agree; It's not compelling on its own, but remains within the realm of potential options when exploring self-care products.

Overall, while acknowledging the relevance to daily life, my cautious and thorough nature leads me to be skeptical about such a definitive claim in an ad. Hence, it won't prompt immediate purchase intent but might linger as a possibility for future consideration based on more comprehensive research or personal experiences.
