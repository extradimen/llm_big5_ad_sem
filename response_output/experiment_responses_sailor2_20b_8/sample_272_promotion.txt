**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

- **Interesting:** Agree (Score: 4)
  - I find the idea of a drink that promotes energy and appearance to be intriguing.

- **Good:** Strongly Agree (Score: 5)
  - The ad effectively communicates benefits important for maintaining daily performance, which is persuasive from an informational standpoint.

- **Attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)
  - While appealing in terms of functionality, the visual or emotional appeal of the advertisement doesn't strongly draw me in.

### Purchase Intention
- **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
  - Despite liking some aspects, I'm not immediately motivated enough by this ad alone to buy the product right now.

- **Will try to buy:** Neutral (Score: 3)
  - There's no compelling urge yet; however, it could influence future purchase decisions if other factors align.

- **Consider buying:** Agree (Score: 4)
  - The advertisement encourages me to keep this option in mind and consider purchasing the product under favorable circumstances or promotions. 

Overall, while I appreciate its informational value and message's relevance, immediate action is unlikely due to personal priorities and reserved nature. However, it leaves a positive impression for future consideration.
