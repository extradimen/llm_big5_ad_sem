**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude**: 
  - *I like the ad.* (2): The talkative and generally trusting nature leans me towards finding it mildly engaging but not overly appealing.
  - *Interesting*: (3) Since I am sometimes careless, detailed ads may not capture my attention as much.
  - *Good*: (4) As someone who tends to be thorough in some aspects, the positive messaging resonates somewhat positively for daily benefits.
  - *Attractive*: (5) The promise of looking good and being energized aligns with a desire for practical self-care solutions.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend to purchase.* (2): My limited income makes high-cost products less likely without substantial benefit evidence.
  - *Try to buy.* (3): Neutral disposition towards trying new things, but not strongly compelled by this ad alone.
  - *Consider buying.* (4): The product fits into my lifestyle needs; thus, itâ€™s a considered option though not guaranteed.

Overall, while the advertisement is somewhat attractive and perceived positively due to practical benefits, actual purchase behavior would depend on additional factors like cost-effectiveness and tangible outcomes.
