**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (4):** Neutral leaning towards a mild liking; finds it somewhat appealing due to its straightforward messaging.
- **Interesting (5):** Moderately interesting as it directly addresses fatigue and appearance concerns, which can be relatable.
- **Believe is good (3):** Neutral with slight skepticism. The statement seems overemphasized for daily life scenarios without concrete evidence of effectiveness.
- **Attractive (2):** Not very attractive; feels somewhat manipulative in its tone about looking dull.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (1):** Strongly disagree – Despite the concerns, there's a lack of compelling reason or trust factor driving an immediate buy decision.
- **Try to buy (1):** Strongly disagree – No urgency or strong desire to experiment with this product based on the ad alone.
- **Consider buying (2):** Slightly agree – May consider if other factors align later, but not immediately influenced by this advertisement. 

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance in addressing common issues, the ad lacks sufficient credibility and personal resonance for a direct purchase decision or strong attraction from someone with my background and traits.
