**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like (4/7):** Neutral with a slightly positive inclination. As someone who values thoroughness and emotional stability but is reserved in social settings, I appreciate straightforward messaging.
  - **Interesting (3/7):** Mildly interesting; it resonates somewhat, particularly for health-conscious concerns.
  - **Good (5/7):** Generally agreeable due to its focus on energy and appearance improvement, aligning with my responsibility as a civil servant but not overly compelling.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** Low attractiveness because the claim feels generic; I seek more specific details or credible evidence.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (1/7):** Strongly disagree. The ad lacks personal relevance and sufficient credibility to prompt immediate purchase intent.
  - **Try (2/7):** Neutral leaning towards slightly negative, meaning it does not encourage me enough to actively seek a trial.
  - **Consider (2/7):** Mild consideration; though I acknowledge the benefits, my preference for detailed information before making decisions makes me hesitate.

Overall, while recognizing its general appeal and functional claims, this ad falls short in engaging or convincing someone with a reserved yet conscientious personality like mine. The lack of specific details and emotional resonance lowers both attraction scores and purchase intention significantly.
