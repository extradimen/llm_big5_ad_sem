**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score 3) – The energetic and appearance-focused claims might not resonate strongly but are neither disliked.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree (Score 2) – As a blue-collar worker, I prefer more practical benefits over surface-level promises of "looking best."
  - **Believe it's good:** Agree (Score 4) – While neutral towards attractiveness, the concept of staying energized aligns with my need for productivity.
  - **Attractive:** Neutral (Score 3) – The visual appeal or design might not strongly attract me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1) – Limited income, focus on practical needs over lifestyle enhancements make this less likely.
  - **Try to buy:** Disagree (Score 2) – The desire for a thorough job and planned approach means I'd consider after careful thought rather than immediate impulse.
  - **Consider buying:** Neutral (Score 3) – If the product’s functionality aligns with my lifestyle needs, it might be considered but not an automatic choice.

In summary, while recognizing its potential benefits, practical considerations and personal priorities lead me to a moderately neutral-to-negative evaluation of purchasing intent.
