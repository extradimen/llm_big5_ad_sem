**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (Score 3):** The ad doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its rather generic claims.
  - **Interesting (Score 4):** It has an element of intrigue regarding fatigue and appearance but lacks novelty in execution for a postgraduate student like myself who’s used to more data-driven messages.
  - **Good (Score 2):** The message is effective on a surface level, but it feels overly simplistic and not deeply convincing. 
  - **Attractive (Score 2):** While the concept might appeal superficially, my reserved nature finds this lack of detailed evidence unattractively vague.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score 1):** Strongly disagree; no compelling reason or urgency from the ad.
  - **Try to Buy (Score 1):** Similarly, I'm not motivated enough based on this persuasive tactic alone.
  - **Consider Buying (Score 2):** Slight consideration might arise if there’s additional credible information or a brand I trust, but as it stands, my emotional stability and critical nature lean towards caution rather than immediate action.

Overall, the ad falls short in engaging me deeply enough to drive purchase intent despite its preventive messaging. More personalized, evidence-based claims would better align with my profile and preferences.
