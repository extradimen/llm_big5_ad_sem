**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad:** Neutral (3). While it has a good message, its overall appeal doesn't particularly resonate with me.

2. **Interesting:** Agree (4). The idea of staying energized and looking best every day is intriguing enough to hold my attention briefly.

3. **Believe the Ad is Good:** Strongly Agree (5). As someone who values health and efficiency, promoting energy and appearance benefits aligns well with my goals.

4. **Attractive:** Disagree (2). The ad's design or presentation doesn't stand out strongly enough to make it visually appealing for me personally.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (3). While the product seems beneficial, there are other factors such as price and brand trust that need consideration.
2. **Try to Buy:** Agree (4). I'm inclined to give it a try if available at an affordable price point or during promotional periods.
3. **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5). Given its potential benefits for energy and appearance, this product definitely fits my lifestyle considerations and future purchases.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates value but lacks immediate attractiveness; thus, I'm moderately inclined to make a purchase after due consideration.
