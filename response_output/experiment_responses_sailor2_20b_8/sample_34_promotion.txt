**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like the Ad:** Strongly Agree (6) – While energetic and engaging ads generally appeal to my talkative, sociable nature, I find it slightly overpromised.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (5) – The promise of looking "your best" is intriguing but somewhat cliché. It catches attention without being groundbreaking.
   - **Believe the Ad is Good:** Neutral Tend to Agree (4.5) – The claims seem reasonable, though I need more concrete proof for full belief in its effectiveness.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (5) – Visually and emotionally attractive, resonating with my desire for a boost at work but slightly exaggerated on the cosmetic benefits.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Somewhat Neutral Tendency Towards Disagree (3.5) – While I might be drawn to it due to its promise of energy, other factors like budget and existing preferences will hold me back from a strong commitment.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Mildly Agree Tending Towards Neutral (2.5) – Given my cautious nature and cost constraints, trying the product feels conditional rather than inevitable.
   - **Consider Buying:** Slightly Positive Consideration (3) – It's on the radar for consideration but not a top priority right now; more information or offers might tip the scales.

Overall, while I appreciate the message’s appeal to my social and energetic personality traits, doubts about credibility and practical relevance dampen immediate purchasing intent. The ad is persuasive enough to keep me interested but does not yet drive an urgent purchase decision.
