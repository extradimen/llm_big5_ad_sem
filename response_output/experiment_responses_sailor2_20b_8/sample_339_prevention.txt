**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral; it doesn't excite me but neither does it bother.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Somewhat agreeable, but not compelling enough to grab my attention fully.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - Relatively neutral leaning toward agreement; technically well-made and informative.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; it lacks emotional appeal or personal relevance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; my current financial constraints prevent serious consideration.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning towards "may consider" under better circumstances, but unlikely due to budget limitations and skepticism over immediate need.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Slightly agree; the message about fatigue prevention is acknowledged, yet practicality overshadows interest.

Overall, while understanding its appeal as a preventive beverage, my personal traits—such as careful spending habits and general skepticism of immediate needs—lead me to view this ad positively but with minimal purchase intent. The lack of budget flexibility significantly diminishes actual buying behavior despite finding the message relevant.
