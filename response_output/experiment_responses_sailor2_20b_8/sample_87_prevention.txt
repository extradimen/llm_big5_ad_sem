**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - *Neutral* towards liking the ad because, despite being a blue-collar worker who values reliability, it doesn't significantly resonate with my daily struggles or needs right now (Strongly Disagree).
  - Finds the ad *interesting* since its message is clear about addressing fatigue and appearance, aligning somewhat with practical concerns (Agree).
  - Believes the ad is *disagreeably good* because while relevant to wellness, it feels overly promotional without substantial credibility or trustworthiness (Disagree).
  - Feels *neutral* in terms of attractiveness; visually appealing but not enough to draw strong emotional engagement (Neutral).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Strongly Disagree* with immediate intent due to skepticism about quick fixes and a preference for more reliable solutions.
  - Slightly inclined to try the product based on curiosity and occasional need for energy boost (Agree).
  - Likely to consider buying it over time if backed by credible reviews, affordability within my budget range of 16-25 million VND per month, or personal needs aligning closely with its claims (Strongly Agree). 

This balanced view reflects both cautious skepticism and open-minded consideration typical for a practical yet conscientious individual like myself.
