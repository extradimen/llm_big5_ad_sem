}
```

**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (score 4)** - While I appreciate its upbeat message, my reserved and somewhat cynical nature means it doesn't strongly engage me.
   
2. **Interesting (score 5)** - The concept of staying energized is appealing to many people, making this part intriguing.

3. **Good (score 3)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; the claim seems reasonable but not entirely convincing due to my cautious nature and lack of trust in quick-fix solutions.
   
4. **Attractive (score 2)** - The ad's appearance might be average or generic, which doesn't capture my attention significantly given my strong preference for originality.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (score 1)** - Strongly disagree; considering my often careless approach and current financial status, the likelihood of making a planned purchase is low.
   
2. **Try to Buy (score 3)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; I might give it a try if recommended by friends or at a discount but not as an immediate priority.
   
3. **Consider Buying (score 2)** - Slightly disagree; the ad doesn't drive strong enough interest, and my tendency toward emotional stability means I'm unlikely to impulsively buy based on this promotion alone.

Overall, while the message aligns somewhat with personal goals of energy and appearance improvement, it falls short in engaging me due to my reserved nature and practical considerations. The low purchase intention reflects a cautious approach influenced by my personality traits and financial status.
