**Detailed Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
     The direct warning about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with my concern for productivity and appearance but doesn’t evoke strong emotional connection.

     It presents a clear problem-solution scenario, making it engaging to someone like me who values efficiency.

     The message is straightforward and potentially beneficial for my lifestyle. Its focus aligns with maintaining energy levels during office hours.
   
   - **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
     While practical, it lacks a creative or emotional appeal that might make me feel more connected to the product.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
     Although I acknowledge its benefits, my current routine and budget balance prevent an immediate commitment.
   
   - **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 3 (Agree)*
     Given the potential for better focus at work, there's motivation to give it a trial but not necessarily immediately.
