**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**  
  The advertisement is okay but not particularly engaging or exciting for me.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**  
  It's mildly intriguing, but doesn't grab my attention strongly.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2)**  
  I find it somewhat credible; the message resonates at a basic level, though not impressively executed.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**  
  It lacks appeal due to its generic nature and doesn't connect well with my personality traits or lifestyle.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**  
  Given my cautious nature, lack of strong trust in the message, and practical mindset, I have no immediate intention.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**  
  While mildly considered due to its preventive claim, my tendency towards skepticism makes me hesitant rather than proactive about trying it out.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**  
  There's a minimal chance I'll revisit the idea in the future, but not enough to make any purchase plans now.

Overall, while the ad presents itself adequately for its intended message, my personal preferences and cautious outlook lower both enjoyment of the advertisement and likelihood of making a purchase.
