**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like the Ad:* Neutral (3) – The concept seems basic, not overly appealing to me.
  - *Interesting:* Agree (4) – It does capture attention as it promises energy and appearance benefits, but doesn't excite strongly.
  - *Believe the Ad is Good:* Strongly Agree (5) – As a blue-collar worker needing boosts throughout my day, this claim resonates with practicality if credible.
  - *Attractive:* Disagree (2) – The pitch lacks emotional appeal or personal connection for me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Strongly Disagree (1) – Despite the benefits mentioned, my current budget constrains any extra spending on luxury items.
  - *Will Try to Buy:* Disagree (2) – Even with the potential appeal of staying energized and looking good, there's not enough incentive or immediate need for me to prioritize this over basic needs.
  - *Will Consider Buying:* Neutral (3) – While I acknowledge its usefulness, financial constraints mean it remains in consideration rather than a planned purchase.

Balancing my values, personality traits, and budgetary realities results in moderate appreciation of the ad's message but lower intent to buy due to practical limitations.
