**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **Like (score 3)**: The ad is somewhat engaging due to its promises of energy and appearance benefits. However, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personal preferences.
- **Interesting (score 4)**: While the concept seems relevant for maintaining daily performance, I find it moderately interesting but not exceptionally so.
- **Good (score 5)**: The advertisement presents itself as beneficial, aligning somewhat well with a desire to stay energized and look good. There's credibility in its message, though it falls short of being outstanding.
- **Attractive (score 2)**: Although I appreciate the idea, thereâ€™s not much visual or emotional appeal that would strongly attract me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend (score 2)**: The low score here reflects hesitancy. My budget constraints and cautious nature mean I am unlikely to immediately commit.
- **Try (score 1)**: Given my limited income, trying the product seems impractical without strong assurance of value or need.
- **Consider (score 3)**: There is a level of consideration as the idea aligns with health goals; however, practical concerns and other priorities prevent an immediate decision.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad appealing, my reserved nature, financial limitations, and cautious approach temper any strong intent to purchase. The appeal doesn't fully outweigh potential costs or personal circumstances.
