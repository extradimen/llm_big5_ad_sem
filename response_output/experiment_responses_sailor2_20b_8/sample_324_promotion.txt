**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While not strongly negative, I find it mildly appealing due to the focus on energy and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2)** - It's not particularly engaging or innovative; feels more generic than unique.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - Neutral-to-positive belief, as it presents a clear benefit but lacks emotional resonance for me.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)** - Not visually compelling or persuasive given my reserved and somewhat cautious personality.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Low intent; I am generally careful with spending and skeptical of health/beauty claims.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - Somewhat open to a trial if it's reasonably priced, but not proactive in seeking out new products.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - Willingly entertain the idea for future purchase opportunities or special deals.

In summary, while I appreciate the potential benefits highlighted by the ad, my reserved and practical nature lead to lower scores on attractiveness and immediate intent. A strong promotional effort might sway me more towards considering it, but not enough to drive an enthusiastic purchase decision.
