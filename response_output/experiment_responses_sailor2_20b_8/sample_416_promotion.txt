**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — The claim of staying energized resonates, but it doesn’t excite me.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree (2) — The general premise is standard for energy drinks and not particularly novel to me.
  - **Good:** Agree (4) — The ad seems reasonable in its promise, though not impressive enough.
  - **Attractive:** Slightly Disagree (2.5) — It doesn't visually appeal or emotionally draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1.5) — Despite the claims, my lifestyle and financial situation make buying it seem unnecessary.
  - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree (1) — No strong incentive or urgency makes me unwilling to invest time in trying this product.
  - **Consider Buying:** Disagree (2) — While I acknowledge its potential benefits, personal priorities and habits discourage consideration.

Overall, while the ad has some merit, my talkativeness and helpful nature don't translate into a high interest or intention to buy due to practicality concerns. Emotional stability and lack of artistic interest further diminish engagement with this promotional message.
