**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad. (**Score: 3**)  
    Neutral leaning towards slight dislike due to its generic nature and lack of personal connection.
  - I think the ad is interesting. (**Score: 4**)  
    Somewhat interested but not compelling enough given my reserved, non-outgoing personality.
  - I believe the ad is good. (**Score: 5**)  
    Neutral leaning towards agreement; itâ€™s straightforward but not particularly inspiring or trustworthy.
  - I find the ad attractive. (**Score: 2**)  
    Low attractiveness as energy drinks often seem over-promoted and irrelevant to my lifestyle.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I intend to purchase this product. (**Score: 1**)
    Strongly disagree; current low budget and lack of immediate need or interest rule out intention.
  - I will try to buy this product. (**Score: 2**)  
    Low likelihood due to limited disposable income and not feeling a strong desire for the claimed benefits.
  - I will consider buying this product. (**Score: 3**)
    Neutral leaning towards slightly considering it; might evaluate if there's an exceptional promotion or significant need arises, but overall low priority.

Overall, while recognizing its basic efficacy in conveying information (good), my reserved and practical nature means the ad does not persuade me to prioritize purchasing the drink over other essential needs. Financial constraints further reinforce this cautious approach toward energy drinks advertised for daily use.
