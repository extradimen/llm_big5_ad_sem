**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **Like (Score: 2)**: The ad's tone feels somewhat negative and overly dramatic. As a young, talkative person who tends to be critical of manipulative messaging, it doesn't resonate strongly with me.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: While it piques curiosity by addressing common feelings like tiredness and dull looks, the simplicity of its message leaves room for improvement in creativity.

- **Good (Score: 3)**: It's not bad but lacks emotional appeal or a unique selling point. Considering my preferences for clear benefits, I find it satisfactory but average.
  
- **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The ad doesn't feel particularly attractive due to its straightforward and somewhat alarming tone. As someone outgoing with an active imagination, I crave more engaging visuals and compelling storytelling.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend (Score: 1)**: Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and the ad's lack of strong appeal or personalized benefits, I am unlikely to intend purchasing this product.
  
- **Try (Score: 2)**: Although curiosity is piqued, without additional compelling reasons or discounts, trying out the product isn't a top priority.

- **Consider (Score: 3)**: The message does align with my desire for energy and appearance improvement. However, I'll only consider it if reviews support its effectiveness and fit within my budget constraints.

Overall, while slightly engaging, the ad misses critical elements to strongly influence purchase intent based on my personality traits and situation. It's neutral at best but won't push me towards immediate action.
