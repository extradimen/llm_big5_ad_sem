**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad**: 
  - **Like:** Neutral (4): While not passionately drawn, it doesn't bother me either.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (3): It piques my curiosity because staying energized and looking good are relevant to daily life.
  - **Good:** Disagree (2): The claims seem a bit too generic; lacking specific details undermines its credibility for someone like me who values thoroughness.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1): Lacks the appeal due to my reserved nature and skepticism about such broad promises.

- **Purchase Intention**: 
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (2): The ad sparks a "maybe" but not enough to drive an immediate purchase decision.
  - **Try to Buy:** Agree (3): I'm open-minded; might give it a try based on reviews or further information since energy drinks are practical for my lifestyle.
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (4): It's in the consideration set, influenced by its relevance and potential benefits but not clinched due to lack of strong attraction.

Overall, while I find parts intriguing, specific details and credibility would be key drivers for actually buying this product.
