**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score: 2)**:
  - As a sociable person but one who tends to be somewhat careless and rude at times, I find this general "energizing" pitch neutral. It lacks personal connection or humor that might appeal more.

- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**:
  - The promise of looking best every day has a superficial allure but doesn't hook me deeply given my limited engagement with beauty products and routine stress from work.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**:
  - It conveys basic benefits well, but I'm not convinced enough about its unique value compared to other options. The lack of specifics makes it less compelling for a detail-oriented person like me.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**:
  - While visually appealing and catchy, my general carelessness means I don't dwell on such ads; thus, its attractiveness is moderate.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
  - Given my modest income and preference for practical necessities over extras, the likelihood of a significant expenditure here is low. No immediate need or excitement triggers an intent to buy.

- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
  - There’s mild curiosity but not enough motivation to actively seek out or prioritize purchasing it despite its claimed benefits.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**:
  - While I’m open-minded, the current ad doesn’t resonate strongly with my personal values or lifestyle. Therefore, a purchase is unlikely unless circumstances change significantly.

In summary, while neutral to mildly positive about the ad's presentation and message, there isn't enough alignment between its claims and my practical priorities as a young office worker in Southeast Asia. Thus, low scores reflect this lack of strong motivation toward actual purchase intent.
