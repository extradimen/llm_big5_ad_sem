   - It's engaging because energy drinks are relevant in my daily life, especially for work.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3.5)**:
   - Credibility could be improved with specific benefits or testimonials from users.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4.5)**:
   - The visuals and messaging are appealing, focusing on both performance and appearance.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - I'm not strongly motivated due to existing brand loyalty or routine purchases; need more compelling reasons.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**:
   - If the ad offered a special promotion or new features, it might sway me into giving it a try.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)**:
   - It fits my lifestyle needs but is not an immediate priority; would evaluate during need-based decisions.

Overall, while I appreciate its intent and some aspects of the ad are appealing to someone like myself, more concrete benefits and a stronger sense of trust could push my purchase intention higher. The product remains in consideration but lacks urgency without additional incentives or brand credibility reinforcement.
