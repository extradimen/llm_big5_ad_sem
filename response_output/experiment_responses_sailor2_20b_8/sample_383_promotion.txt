**Evaluation:**

Given my reserved nature (`Disagree`), I'm not initially drawn to the vibrant promotion style of the ad. The claims about staying energized align with practical needs but lack emotional appeal for me.

- **Attitude toward Advertisement:**  
    - *Like (2):* Neutral, as it doesn't resonate strongly.
    - *Interesting (3):* Mildly engaging, focusing on common benefits.
    - *Good (4):* It's informative and clear about the product’s utility.
    - *Attractive (5):* Slightly attractive due to its practical value but not compelling enough.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   1. My monthly income is limited (`<15,000,000 VND`), making high-cost purchases challenging (`intend=1`). 
   2. I'll consider trying it if there's a promotional discount or deal (`try=2`).
   3. Future consideration (`consider=3`) exists due to the product’s potential benefit but needs budget flexibility.

Overall, while the ad presents useful features, my reserved nature and financial constraints temper any strong inclination towards immediate purchase. Thus, balanced scores reflect practical evaluation rather than emotional persuasion.
