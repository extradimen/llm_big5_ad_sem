**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* — Neutral (`4`): While sociable, my preferences lean toward real-world benefits rather than just liking an advertisement.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* — Disagree (`3`): The claims are generic and don't spark genuine interest or curiosity.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* — Strongly Disagree (`2`): It lacks specific details to build trust; general promises seem hollow for someone who values thoroughness.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* — Disagree (`3`): The messaging doesn’t align with my reserved and cautious nature, making it unattractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* — Strongly Disagree (`1`): Given my preference for practicality over promises of instant benefits, I'm not inclined.
  - *Will try to buy this product.* — Strongly Disagree (`2`): The lack of compelling evidence or personal relevance makes trying it out seem unnecessary.
  - *Will consider buying this product.* — Strongly Disagree (`2`): Despite being original and imaginative in thought, the ad doesn't sufficiently address my concerns about effectiveness.

Overall, while I acknowledge its existence, the advertisement falls short due to vagueness and a lack of personal relevance against my background and personality traits. Thus, it neither persuades nor influences my purchase intention positively.
