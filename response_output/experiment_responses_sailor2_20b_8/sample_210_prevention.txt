**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - While neutral to slightly agreeable, I find it somewhat generic. The claim of fatigue without the drink seems overused in similar products.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2)**:
   - Not particularly engaging; the message feels common and lacks a unique selling proposition that would pique my interest as an office worker dealing with daily stressors.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**:
   - It's technically correct, but it doesn't resonate strongly due to its general nature. A bit bland for someone who values specificity and effectiveness in product claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**:
   - I tend towards a reserved personality; this lackluster presentation isnâ€™t visually or emotionally appealing enough to draw me in. It doesn't evoke confidence or urgency, essential traits lacking here.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Strongly disagree with the ad's claims due to my cautious nature and tendency towards thoroughness; no compelling reason exists yet.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**:
   - A neutral leaning toward a slight positive, as I'm open to occasional experimentation but won't actively seek it out without more convincing evidence.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)**:
   - Given my reserved nature and careful planning approach, I would keep the option open for future consideration if provided with additional information or a compelling personal experience from others.

Overall, while acknowledging potential efficacy in avoiding tiredness is important to me, the current ad falls short in persuasiveness. More tailored messaging that aligns closely with office worker fatigue specifics could potentially improve both attitude and purchase intent scores.
