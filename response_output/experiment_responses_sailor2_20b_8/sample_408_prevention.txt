**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (3)**: Neutral to slightly positive; I find it acceptable but not particularly appealing given my preference for concise and impactful messaging.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (2)**: Disagree, as the straightforward message about feeling tired or looking dull feels somewhat generic and doesn't grab attention effectively.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: Agree; it conveys a clear benefit, though not exceptionally well crafted for engagement.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (1)**: Strongly Disagree; my preference leans toward more compelling visuals or creative approaches.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Neutral leaning towards negative; while acknowledging its potential benefit, there's no strong desire based on current presentation.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (3)**: Slightly Agree; I might give it a chance if recommended or during low-risk situations but not actively seeking out of my own initiative.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (2)**: Neutral leaning towards consideration; the ad doesn't sufficiently motivate me, so I'll only think about purchasing under specific circumstances.

Overall, while understanding its purpose and benefits, the advertisement falls short in engaging someone with a balanced mix of practicality and emotional resonance like myself. A stronger creative angle could improve persuasiveness and intention to purchase.
