**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - *Like:* Neutral leaning towards Disagree (Score = 3) – The direct language and potential scare tactics are not particularly appealing.
   - *Interesting:* Agree (Score = 4) – It does pique curiosity about fatigue, but could be overly dramatic for daily consumption.
   - *Good:* Disagree (Score = 2) – Lacks depth; feels too transactional rather than informative or empathetic.
   - *Attractive:* Neutral leaning towards Agree (Score = 5) – The concept of avoiding tiredness is attractive, but the ad's style may not fully engage me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase:* Moderate Disagree (Score = 3) – While I understand the benefit, personal habits and budget play a role.
   - *Try to buy:* Agree (Score = 4) – The potential for trying once is higher due to curiosity about results, especially under fatigue-prone situations.
   - *Consider buying:* Strong Consideration (Score = 5) – It aligns with health-conscious goals; though not immediate, I'll weigh it against alternatives.

Overall, the ad highlights a real concern but falls short on emotional resonance and credibility. The scores reflect moderate intention to explore further rather than instant purchase commitment.
