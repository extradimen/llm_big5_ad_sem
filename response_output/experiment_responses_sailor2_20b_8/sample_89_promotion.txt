**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad (4):** While I appreciate its intention to energize and enhance appearance, it feels somewhat generic.
   - **Interesting (5):** The message is clear but not particularly engaging for someone who prefers practicality over flashiness.
   - **Good Quality Ad (6):** Strongly agree because it addresses important concerns about energy levels and personal grooming.
   - **Attractive (3):** Disagree; the ad lacks personalized appeal or emotional connection to resonate deeply.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** 2 (Neutral leaning towards disagree)
     - Though I value staying energized, previous experiences with similar products have been mixed.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** 3 (Agree)
     - There's enough evidence of benefits that warrants giving it a try, especially due to its thoroughness and trustworthiness.
   - **Consider Buying:** 4 (Strongly Agree)
     - I am open-minded about new products but will need more direct feedback or personal testimonials before making a final decision.

In summary, while the ad has some strong points in terms of credibility and helpfulness, it falls short on emotional engagement for me. Thus, though positive scores indicate willingness to consider the product, my purchase intention remains balanced with cautious optimism rather than immediate commitment.
