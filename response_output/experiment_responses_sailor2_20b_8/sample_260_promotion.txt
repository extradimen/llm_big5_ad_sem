**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - While I find it engaging due to my talkative nature and tendency for strong agreement in trusting elements, there's a mixed feeling given its superficial focus on appearance which might not resonate deeply.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - Neutral sociability combined with general interest but less excitement because of repetitive health/beauty claims.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2/7):**
   - Low score due to skepticism from my high worry and untrustworthy tendencies regarding such promises without substantiation or evidence.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - Slightly positive, mainly because it caters to energy needs that are relevant in a busy office role but lacks emotional appeal.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - Low intent despite the need for energy; distrust and lack of compelling proof hinder immediate decision-making.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (3/7):**
   - A cautious approach given my worries, but moderate inclination due to daily functional requirements.

3. **I will consider buying this product (1/7):**
   - Very low consideration score; the ad fails to align with strong preferences for thoroughness and reliability in purchasing decisions. 

Overall, while I'm not wholly turned off by the advertisement, its persuasive power is significantly limited due to my personality traits and skeptical nature regarding health/beauty claims without robust backing or personal relevance beyond surface-level needs.
