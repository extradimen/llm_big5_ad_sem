**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score 3) – The promise of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance appeals to me but doesn’t evoke strong liking.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (Score 4) – It presents a clear benefit, which is engaging enough for someone looking to boost energy.
    - **Good:** Agree (Score 5) – It's effective in highlighting the problem it solves, making the message sound credible and valuable.
    - **Attractive:** Disagree (Score 2) – The ad may be functional but doesn't capture my attention or emotional engagement fully.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1) – While I recognize the benefit, other factors like budget and alternatives need consideration.
    - **Will try to buy this product:** Agree (Score 2) – There's curiosity, but it’s not enough for a committed trial.
    - **Will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score 2) – It will be on my radar if I’m in the market for energy boosters, but won’t drive an immediate purchase.

This evaluation reflects my generally trusting nature and appreciation of straightforward messaging while balancing practicality with emotional appeal. The ad is effective at highlighting a need but falls short on compelling me to act immediately due to personal preferences and financial considerations.
