**Evaluation and Thought Process:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score 4):** Neutral interest; as a blue-collar worker with long hours, staying energized is relevant, but the overall appeal doesn't strongly engage me due to my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting:** The concept resonates lightly—being more energetic and looking good daily sounds beneficial. A moderate score of 3 reflects some intrigue without strong enthusiasm.
   - **Good (Score 5):** As a thorough person with practical values, the message aligns reasonably well with health and wellness goals but doesn't evoke exceptional trust or excitement.
   - **Attractive (Score 2):** Being reserved and sometimes careless makes me less inclined to find the ad visually or conceptually compelling. Hence, low attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my practical approach and a busy lifestyle needing energy boosts, there's mild intention but not strong commitment (Score 2).
   - **Try to Buy:** The slight appeal of the product’s benefits makes me open to trying it once (Score 3).
   - **Consider Buying:** Considering financial constraints (monthly income range), I would weigh this against other necessities. Hence, a moderate consideration score of 4.

In summary, while the advertisement has some relevance and practical value, my reserved nature and occasional tendency toward carelessness mean that although considered useful, it doesn’t trigger high engagement or immediate purchase intent.
