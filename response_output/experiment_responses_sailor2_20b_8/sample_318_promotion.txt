**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3/7):** I appreciate its goal to energize and enhance appearance but feel it could be more engaging.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):** It has a clear message, though not overly compelling for someone like me who prefers detailed information.
   - **I believe the ad is good (5/7):** The core promise resonates well with my need to stay focused and presentable; however, it needs better support in its claims.
   - **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** My talkative nature leans towards ads that are more interactive or have strong emotional hooks, which this lacks.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (4/7):** Although I recognize it could meet my needs, other factors like reviews and personal preferences would sway me more.
   - **Will try to buy this product (3/7):** A middle ground; curiosity is piqued but not enough to commit without further research or user feedback.
   - **Consider buying the product (4/7):** There's a consideration phase where I acknowledge potential benefits, though it might take additional convincing.

Overall, while there are positive aspects, specific traits like my preference for thoroughness and careful planning mean that this ad needs more substance to strongly influence my purchase decision.
