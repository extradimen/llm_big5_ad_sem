}
```

**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (score = 3)**: I appreciate its straightforwardness but find it somewhat clich√©.
2. **Interesting (score = 4)**: It has a basic appeal due to common wellness themes, yet doesn't grab my attention intensely.
3. **Good (score = 2)**: While not bad, the ad's claims feel generic and lack substance or innovative details that would set it apart.
4. **Attractive (score = 5)**: The presentation is visually decent but falls short of truly engaging me due to overused energy-boosting promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score = 1)**: Given my skepticism and preference for unique, well-researched options, this ad isn't persuasive enough.
2. **Try to buy (score = 2)**: I might give it a chance if the product has strong reviews or is endorsed by trusted sources; otherwise, no impulse purchase here.
3. **Consider buying (score = 4)**: There's potential for consideration after seeing more details about ingredients, proven efficacy, and user experiences.

This combination reflects my critical approach to health-focused products and preference for substance over surface-level messaging. Despite not being highly motivated by this ad, it opens up room for cautious evaluation rather than immediate rejection.
