   - **Interesting**: Agree (5) – The concept of staying energized and looking good resonates well with me.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (6) – It effectively communicates benefits that are valuable to a 20–29-year-old managerial employee like myself.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (3) – While the message is strong, the overall visual or emotional appeal isn't highly captivating.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase** (Neutral): Although I appreciate the benefits, it's not a high priority right now due to my current financial situation and daily routine.
   - **Will try**: Disagree (3) – The hesitation comes from wanting more direct evidence of effectiveness or personal testimonials before committing immediately.
   - **Consider buying** (Agree): Given its potential positive impact on energy levels and appearance, it's definitely worth considering as part of my lifestyle choices.
