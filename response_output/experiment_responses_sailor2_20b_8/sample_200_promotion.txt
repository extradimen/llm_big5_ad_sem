**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 4) - While not strongly positive, it's slightly favorable due to its energetic and self-care messaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3) - Neutral leaning toward a bit intriguing, particularly because I appreciate the promise of looking good daily, though it feels somewhat generic.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 2) - Somewhat skeptical; promises seem too perfect and may lack credibility with my current reality-focused mindset.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 1) - Not appealing to me due to perceived manipulationâ€”energizing drinks feel like a quick fix rather than genuine solutions.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) - Low intent; although I understand needing energy, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with my cautious and practical nature.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) - Slightly higher than "intend" due to curiosity but not enough conviction for an immediate purchase.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3) - The ad might prompt me to think about it if my needs align with staying energized, making the consideration plausible.

Overall, while I'm aware of the benefits highlighted, personal traits like skepticism and practicality keep my interest low but open for future contemplation.
