**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **I like the ad:** (Score: 5) While I appreciate its appeal to energy and appearance which are important aspects of daily life, my talkative nature keeps me open-minded but not overly enthusiastic.
   - **Interesting:** (Score: 4) The promise of staying energized is generally interesting, though it could benefit from more compelling details or unique selling points.
   - **Good:** (Score: 3) As a civil servant with an active lifestyle, the idea seems good, yet my neutral sociability and lack of strong belief in its claims lower this score slightly.
   - **Attractive:** (Score: 2) Though visually appealing ads can be effective, I find the attractiveness limited due to perceived trust issues ("sometimes rude") and a need for more substantiated benefits.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** (Score: 3) My thorough job ethics align with considering products carefully, but without strong personal connection or immediate urgency, my intention is moderate.
   - **Will Try Buying:** (Score: 4) The strategic nature of following through on plans suggests a willingness to give it a try after evaluating further details and user reviews.
   - **Consider Buying:** (Score: 3) While I have an active imagination that might lead me to consider new ideas, my neutral-to-disagree tendencies toward helpfulness/unselfishness mean practical considerations take precedence over impulse.

Overall, while the ad is positively received due to its relevance to daily energy and appearance needs, it doesn't strongly compel immediate action given my balanced evaluation of trustworthiness and personal values. Hence, a moderate yet cautious approach in considering purchase intent.
