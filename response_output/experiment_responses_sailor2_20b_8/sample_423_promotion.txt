**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3)
   - While I appreciate that energy and appearance benefits are marketed, my neutral-to-disagree traits in sociability and thoroughness don't make me feel strongly connected to it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4)
   - The concept seems appealing for staying energized, but it doesn’t capture much of my attention due to my generally more reserved nature.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5)
   - On balance, energy drinks can be beneficial; hence, I find it positively reinforcing without being overly persuasive or manipulative.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) 
   - My cautious and somewhat nervous tendencies make me skeptical about its effectiveness claims, reducing perceived attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1)
   - Despite believing in the benefits, my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income) and careful nature lead me not to seriously consider buying it right now.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3)
   - I’m open-minded but cautious; if there’s a promotional offer or significant need for energy boosters, I might give it a chance.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 4) 
   - The idea of maintaining better appearance and energy is appealing enough that I wouldn't dismiss the option entirely—it's in my consideration set but not a priority purchase at present. 

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately well with me personally, practical considerations weigh heavily against immediate action. Thus, it holds potential interest without strong drive to buy immediately.
