**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (4). The prevention-focused tone resonates somewhat, but it doesn’t evoke strong feelings.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (3). The concept of staying alert and looking fresh is intriguing enough to capture my attention briefly.
   - **Good quality:** Disagree (5). While I see its relevance, the ad lacks sufficient trustworthiness or personal connection for me.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (2). As someone who tends to be a bit careless and nervous easily, the implied pressure feels manipulative rather than appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Neutral (4). The idea appeals on some level, but not enough for immediate action.
   - **Will try:** Agree (3). I'm open to trying if it’s within my budget and easily available without high expectations.
   - **Consider buying:** Disagree (5). Though the potential benefits are noted, personal lifestyle factors (e.g., daily routines) would still need convincing.

In summary, while there is some moderate interest in avoiding fatigue and improving appearance, other personality traits such as carelessness and nervousness make me cautious about making a purchase decision. The ad effectively piques curiosity but falls short of driving strong intention or confidence.
