**Evaluation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - Neutral to slightly positive; the ad has a decent presentation but doesn't excite me much.
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)** - Agree; it presents a unique value proposition regarding energy and appearance, which is relevant in my daily life as an active civil servant.
3. **Good (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning negative; while the message is clear, I feel some skepticism about its effectiveness without more substantiation or evidence.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree; it lacks emotional appeal and creative flair for my tastes.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Score of 1 – Strongly disagree; despite the ad’s points, there's no strong enough personal motivation or trust in the product.
2. **Will Try to Buy**: Score of 1 – Strongly disagree; without additional incentives (e.g., discounts, user testimonials), I'm unlikely to invest time and money into something unconvincing.
3. **Consider Buying**: Score of 2 – Slightly agree; there is some potential appeal due to the advertised benefits, but not enough to make a concrete decision.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance, the ad falls short in persuasive power for someone like me who values thoroughness and credibility over general promises. Additional evidence or compelling details about efficacy would significantly elevate my interest and intention to purchase.
