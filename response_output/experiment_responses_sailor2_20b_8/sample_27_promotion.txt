**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate an energetic and positive message, my neutral to slightly agree stance reflects a balanced view; it's not highly engaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - The promise of staying energized resonates moderately with me as someone who values productivity but doesn't find the concept groundbreaking.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - It effectively conveys benefits relevant to everyday life, making it a decent advertisement in my opinion.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Though not strikingly attractive, its clean message appeals mildly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** – The ad doesn't inspire immediate action due to personal moderation and financial considerations in my income bracket.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 4)** - It's not a high priority but worth considering if the benefits align with current needs or preferences.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** – A neutral leaning towards consideration; it’s on my radar, especially when looking for an energy boost supplement.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad appealing and reasonably persuasive, my cautious nature and personal context mean it doesn't drive a strong immediate purchase intent. Hence, balanced but moderate scores reflect this nuanced response.
