**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3). As a reserved and somewhat critical person, the ad doesn't strongly evoke positive emotions but isn't disliked either.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (2). Given my preference for factual information over flashy marketing, I find it slightly uninteresting.
   - **Good:** Agree (4). The claim of staying energized and looking good aligns with practical needs and appears legitimate enough to be considered valuable.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3). While not visually or emotionally compelling, the messaging is straightforward without being off-putting.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Agree (5). The product's benefits resonate with my lifestyle as a civil servant needing sustained energy and perhaps some focus on personal appearance.
   - **Try:** Strongly Agree (6). I'm willing to give it a try, driven by the clear utility despite being cautious about marketing hype.
   - **Consider:** Agree (4). Although not an immediate purchase decision, there's serious consideration due to perceived value.

Overall, while my critical nature doesn't make me overly enthusiastic about the ad, its practical benefits and strong intentionality in planning align well with my traits and needs. Thus, a moderate-to-strong leaning towards both liking aspects of the advertisement and considering purchasing the product.
