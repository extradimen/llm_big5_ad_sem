**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score 4):** While I appreciate its intent to highlight potential drawbacks without the product, it doesn't resonate deeply. It feels somewhat manipulative.
  - **Interesting (score 3):** The message is clear but lacks creative flair or compelling storytelling elements that would captivate me fully.
  - **Good (score 2):** Although basic information seems accurate, it falls short in emotional appeal and persuasive depth.
  - **Attractive (score 1):** Despite being well-made for a prevention ad, my outgoing nature prefers more engaging visuals and dynamics.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (score 2):** While I acknowledge the potential benefits, it doesn't drive immediate action; other factors like price, brand trust, or personal needs would be crucial.
  - **Try to buy (score 3):** The ad encourages curiosity and mild consideration without strong conviction for trying out.
  - **Consider buying (score 4):** Given my managerial responsibilities and high follow-through tendency, I'm inclined to weigh the product against other alternatives seriously.

Overall, the advertisement is functional but lacks emotional connection or standout features that would sway me strongly. It earns moderate interest levels rather than immediate purchase intent.
