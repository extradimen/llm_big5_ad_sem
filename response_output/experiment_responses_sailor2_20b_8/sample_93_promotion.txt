**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (score=5)**: While I appreciate that it's well-intended, being a young office worker who enjoys staying energized doesn't make me strongly like the ad. It resonates somewhat but not overwhelmingly.
  
- **Interesting (score=4)**: The claim of "staying energized" is relevant to my daily grind, so it catches some interest, though neutral elements elsewhere balance this out.

- **Good (score=6)**: I believe the message is generally positive and effective for its target audience. It aligns with maintaining a productive lifestyle, making it well-crafted in that regard.

- **Attractive (score=3)**: The ad appears visually appealing, but personally, my strong imagination leans more towards creative promotions rather than just energy drinks, so this score stays lower.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (score=2)**: Although I appreciate the product's benefit of boosting energy and looking good, it isn't a priority given my current budget and other competing needs. So, strong intention is low.
  
- **Try to buy (score=1)**: Given that energy drinks are readily available alternatives in the market, trying this one feels less compelling.

- **Consider buying (score=2)**: I might consider it under special circumstances or if my current options fail to meet expectations. Otherwise, other priorities take precedence over routine purchase of such items.

Overall, while the ad is reasonably appealing and well-presented, my personality traits—such as financial consideration and a preference for original ideas—lead me to maintain moderate interest without strong intent to buy this specific product.
