3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score: 4) - The message seems clear and relevant, but it doesn't evoke strong trust or enthusiasm from me given its simplicity.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1) - As a reserved person with few artistic interests, I don’t find the visual presentation appealing enough to draw my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1) - Despite understanding its benefits, personal lifestyle and financial constraints make it unlikely.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1) - No immediate drive or urgency exists for me to initiate a purchase attempt.
