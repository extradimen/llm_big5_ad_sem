**Explanation:**
1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like*: Neutral due to my reserved nature and preference for practicality.
   - *Interesting*: Disagree, as it doesn't excite or engage me much given my daily routine focus.
   - *Good*: Somewhat Agree because while I appreciate functional benefits, its appeal isn’t high.
   - *Attractive*: Neutral; visual aspects may not strongly draw me in but aren’t off-putting either.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Disagree due to budget constraints and current priorities elsewhere.
   - *Try to Buy*: Neutral, considering the potential benefits might be worth a try if it fits my monthly income limits.
   - *Consider Buying*: Somewhat Agree; while not immediately necessary, I could see myself giving it a chance based on its promises of energy and appearance improvement. However, practicality remains key.

Overall, while open to its message, personal traits, financial constraints, and priorities prevent me from being highly motivated by the ad for an immediate purchase decision.
