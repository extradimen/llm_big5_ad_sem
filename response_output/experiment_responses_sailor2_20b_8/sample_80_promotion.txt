**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 4):**
   - While I appreciate its messaging on energy and appearance, it feels slightly generic given my personality's strong preference for practicality over superficial claims.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 5):**
   - The idea of staying energized appeals to me, especially as a civil servant balancing multiple responsibilities; however, the focus seems more geared towards younger demographics or individuals with different priorities.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 6):**
   - It conveys clear benefits and aligns somewhat with my desire for daily well-being, but lacks depth in explaining how it truly differs from other energy drinks or supplements.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 3):** 
   - The visual appeal is moderate, and it doesn't strongly resonate emotionally due to its broad messaging rather than tailored to personal values like reliability and thoroughness.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 2):**
   - Despite my neutral-to-positive attitude towards the ad's message, there isn’t a compelling reason for me to buy it right now given budget constraints and other health routines I already follow.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
   - There’s some curiosity but not enough drive due to skepticism about its effectiveness compared to alternatives within my price range (<15,000,000 VND).

3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3):** 
   - While I acknowledge it might be beneficial for short-term energy boosts, the consideration remains low because I prioritize sustainable solutions and products with proven long-term benefits over quick fixes.

In summary, while there's appreciation for the ad’s goals of promoting energy and appearance, my critical personality and practical lifestyle lead to a moderately favorable but not high-intention response. The score reflects a cautious interest rather than immediate purchase intent.
