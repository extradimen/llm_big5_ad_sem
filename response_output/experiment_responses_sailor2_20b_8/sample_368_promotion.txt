**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4)**: I find it somewhat appealing due to its promises of energy and improved appearance.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The ad's claims are attention-grabbing but not entirely engaging for me personally.
   - **Good (5)**: It seems well-crafted and effective in conveying benefits, which aligns with my need for a practical boost during daily routines.
   - **Attractive (2)**: I don't find the visual or messaging particularly compelling. My reserved nature means it doesn’t strongly attract me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: While intrigued by its benefits, given my tendency towards caution and thoroughness in decision-making, I'm not convinced enough to intend a direct buy (2).
   - **Try the product**: Given that I’m open to new experiences but tend to be careful ("tend to be careless" cautiously), trying it might follow after more research or reviews (2).
   - **Consider buying**: The benefits resonated with my daily needs, so I'm definitely considering purchasing if further information validates its effectiveness and value for money (3).

In summary, while the ad has some positive aspects that appeal to me due to practical goals like staying energized, it doesn't create an immediate strong pull or enough confidence in a purchase decision. My cautious nature drives my moderate intentions towards exploring rather than committing outright.
