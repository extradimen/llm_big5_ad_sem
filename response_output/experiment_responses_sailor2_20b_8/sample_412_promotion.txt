**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) – Neutral; it's not compelling but doesn't turn me off.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) – Agree; moderately engaging, especially with energy and appearance benefits.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 3) – Slightly agree; claims are plausible for maintaining productivity but not exceptional.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) – Disagree; lacks emotional or personal resonance given my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1) – Strongly disagree; despite mild appeal, it doesn't align with my budget constraints and current needs.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1) – Strongly disagree; no immediate impulse or urgency.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2) – Slightly agree; open to evaluation if circumstances change, but not a priority now.

Overall, the ad is mildly positive but fails to significantly influence my purchase behavior due to budget limitations and personal priorities. It's seen as acceptable rather than compelling or essential for daily life in Southeast Asia at this stage of income level.
