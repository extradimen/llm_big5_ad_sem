**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:**  
   - Score: 3 (Neutral)  
   The strong emphasis on potential negative consequences ("tired," "look dull") resonates moderately but doesn't strongly appeal to my generally reserved nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   - Score: 4 (Agree)  
   While it's engaging by highlighting everyday concerns, its straightforward messaging feels more practical than thrilling for me as someone who values thoroughness and plans.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   - Score: 5 (Strongly Agree)  
   The message promotes prevention from feeling tired or looking dull, aligning with my proactive nature towards maintaining daily well-being and productivityâ€”something a civil servant deeply cares about.

4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   - Score: 2 (Disagree)  
   Despite its effectiveness in conveying a clear benefit, I find it somewhat lacking in visual appeal or creative flair that might draw more emotional engagement from me, given my preference for original ideas and artistic interests.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   - Score: 3 (Neutral)  
   While the ad effectively communicates potential benefits, I'm not immediately compelled due to being cautious about new products without further information or reviews.

2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   - Score: 4 (Agree)  
   Given my strong inclination towards planning and following through, if it fits within my budget concerns and health goals, there's a reasonable chance I would give the product a trial run.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   - Score: 5 (Strongly Agree)  
   The ad piques enough interest in its efficacy to keep me open-minded; however, due diligence through reviews or personal experience with similar products will be essential before making an actual purchase decision. 

Overall, the advertisement is functional and informative but needs more artistic enhancement for a higher engagement level given my background and preferences. Despite this critique, there's strong consideration for purchasing based on its relevance to maintaining daily performance and well-being.
