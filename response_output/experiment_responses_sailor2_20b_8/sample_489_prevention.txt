**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
    - **Like (2/7)**: While I understand its attempt to address fatigue and appearance concerns, it feels somewhat manipulative.
    - **Interesting (3/7)**: The message is straightforward but lacks creativity or engagement for me personally. It's a common trope without much novelty.
    - **Good (4/7)**: Functional in conveying the product benefit, though I think it could be more relatable with better storytelling.
    - **Attractive (1/7)**: Not particularly visually appealing and emotionally unconvincing given my tendency to get nervous easily.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend (1/7)**: Even if the ad resonates slightly, I'm not inclined to buy due to limited budget constraints.
    - **Try (2/7)**: Might consider trying it once just for curiosity or necessity after a long day, but not as part of regular spending habits.
    - **Consider (3/7)**: The product concept is understandable and might be useful; however, my financial situation prevents frequent purchases.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's functional message, its execution doesn't fully connect with me emotionally or motivate immediate purchase. Budget constraints further reinforce a cautious approach towards buying this product.
