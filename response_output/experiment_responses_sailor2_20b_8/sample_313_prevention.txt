**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - I like the ad (score = 3): Neutral leaning slightly negative; it doesn't resonate strongly.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score = 4): Generally finds it moderately engaging but not particularly compelling.
  - I believe the ad is good (score = 2): Disagree; feels manipulative and exaggerated, lacking credibility for me personally.
  - I find the ad attractive (score = 2): Also disagree; visually or conceptually unappealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (score = 1): Strongly disagree; no intention due to lack of relevance and perceived overstatement about benefits.
  - I will try to buy this product (score = 1): Similarly, strongly disagree; not inclined to test it out despite the claims.
  - I will consider buying this product (score = 2): Slightly neutral but leaning negative; might reflect on purchasing if offered under different circumstances or conditions.

Overall, while slightly engaging and interesting, my reserved nature, distrust of such health-focused marketing overstatements, and lack of urgent need for energy drinks lead to a low likelihood of purchase. The ad feels more like fear-mongering than an honest product recommendation.
