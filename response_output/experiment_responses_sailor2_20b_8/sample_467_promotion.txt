**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** While I appreciate energy drinks for their practical benefits (especially staying energized), there are many similar ads in this market that lack originality and creativity. My strong talkative nature might lead me to favor more engaging or unique presentations, so my score is 5 (Neutral leaning towards Agree).
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** The claim of "look your best" feels generic; it doesn't stand out given its broad appeal. As a result, I find it only mildly interesting at 4.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Given my tendency to be cautious (Strongly Disagree with trusting easily) and skeptical about health claims without substantial proof or personal experience, this claim lacks credibility for me, scoring a 3 (Disagree).
4. **I find the ad attractive:** With limited artistic interests and an unimpressive presentation, I'm not visually or emotionally drawn to it, rating it at 2.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Even though energy drinks are useful, my high concern about health (Strongly Agree) combined with the lack of specific benefits detailed in the ad make me unwilling to commit fully; a score of 1.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Being agreeable but also practical and not thoroughly convinced by its promise, I might consider giving it a trial at some point, scoring 2 (Agree).
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Given the moderate benefits highlighted without overwhelming evidence or personal recommendation, "consider" seems realistic; hence, a score of 3.

In summary, while not entirely repelled by the ad, its underwhelming nature and vague promises lead to a cautious approach in purchase intention. I would remain open but skeptical unless more compelling details surface.
