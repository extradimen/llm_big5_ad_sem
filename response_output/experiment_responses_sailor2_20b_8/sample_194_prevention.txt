}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2):** While the concept of preventing tiredness and dull appearance is appealing, I don't strongly like the ad because it feels a bit over-promising.
  - **Interesting (3):** The message is somewhat intriguing but doesn’t captivate me deeply.
  - **Good (4):** It's an average representation; not outstandingly persuasive or well-executed for my taste.
  - **Attractive (1):** Unattractive overall due to the lack of compelling evidence and a hint of overgeneralization.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (2):** I'm not highly inclined to purchase right now, given other priorities and skepticism about its efficacy.
  - **Try (3):** There’s some curiosity but no strong push to give it a try immediately. 
  - **Consider (3):** It will be part of my decision-making process if the product fits within budget constraints or has solid reviews.

Overall, while I acknowledge the potential benefits suggested in the ad, my personality and personal preferences lead me to view it as moderately positive but not strongly compelling enough for an immediate purchase. My cautious nature influences a balanced intention towards considering rather than rushing into buying decisions.
