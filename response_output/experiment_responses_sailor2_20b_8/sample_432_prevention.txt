**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)  
  I find it somewhat engaging but not particularly appealing given my reserved nature. The focus on fatigue resonates to an extent, yet it feels slightly manipulative.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2)  
  It has a basic appeal since feeling tired and looking dull are relatable concerns, but its simplicity doesn't captivate me deeply.

- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4)  
  The message is clear; it addresses common issues effectively. However, my skepticism about such claims slightly reduces my positive perception.

- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 1)  
  Given my strong disagreement with being outgoing or socially influenced by advertisements, I don't feel drawn to this one visually or emotionally.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2)  
  There's a low likelihood of immediate action since the ad doesn’t align strongly with my lifestyle preferences and decision-making processes. 

- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 3)  
  I might give it a chance if prompted by friends or during moments when tiredness is particularly noticeable, but not proactively.

- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 2)  
  While the idea has some merit, my practical nature and tendency to carefully evaluate purchases mean consideration alone isn't enough to spur an actual buy. 

Overall, while I acknowledge its relevance, the ad doesn’t resonate strongly with my personality traits and decision-making style, leading to moderate intent but low overall appeal.
