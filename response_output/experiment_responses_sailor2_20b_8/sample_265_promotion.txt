**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *I like the ad:* (2) Despite being a reserved and somewhat introverted individual with high work ethic but low social engagement, I find the energy aspect appealing yet remain skeptical of its emotional promises.
  - *Interesting:* (3) The concept sounds decent for staying energized; it's not extraordinary enough to spark great interest due to personal preference biases against quick fixes.
  - *Good:* (4) Neutrally considering, since I value thoroughness in work but question the broader appeal and effectiveness without deeper information.  
  - *Attractive:* (1) The ad lacks a strong emotional connection or resonance with my typically reserved nature; thus, it feels less attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product:* (3) While I recognize the need for energy boosters, personal skepticism and financial constraints make an outright intention low.
  - *Will try to buy this product:* (3) There's a slight curiosity but no strong urge; might consider trying it as part of my routine if circumstances align.
  - *Consider buying this product:* (2) Given the lackluster attraction, I am more inclined toward cautious consideration rather than immediate action. 

Overall, the ad does not strongly persuade me due to its superficial appeal and conflicting personal attributes but leaves room for future reconsideration under specific conditions.
