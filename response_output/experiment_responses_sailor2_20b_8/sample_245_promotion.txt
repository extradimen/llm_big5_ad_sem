**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward Advertisement:** 
  - *Like*: Neutral. Despite being talkative and outgoing, the appeal of staying energized and looking good isn't a strong driver for me.
  - *Interesting*: Agree. The idea resonates with my active imagination and originality in new ideas (Strongly Agree).
  - *Good*: Disagree. The message feels generic; it lacks specific credibility or genuine relevance to my daily life as a blue-collar worker, given by my income range.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree. My preference for practical products over flashy promises makes this ad unappealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Consider buying. The need for energy boosts during workdays might make me think about it, but not strongly enough to commit.
  - *Try to buy*: Will consider trying. Curiosity is there due to its interesting nature (Agree), though trust issues and carelessness mean I won't rush into a decision.
  - *Consider buying*: Might consider purchasing eventually. The persuasive elements are balanced by my cautious approach towards new products, making it a low-risk option worth thinking about.

Overall, while the ad sparks curiosity, it falls short on strong attraction due to personal values and practicality concerns but still holds some appeal for future consideration.
