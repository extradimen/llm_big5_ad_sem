**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Neutral)**: The ad's claim resonates with potential fatigue but doesn't excite me enough given my preference for practical solutions over emotional appeals.
   - **Interesting (Agree)**: I find it engaging because it directly addresses a common issue—feeling tired and looking dull, which can be relevant to anyone working long hours.
   - **Good (Disagree)**: While the message is clear, the overall presentation may lack depth or evidence for credibility; thus, I doubt its effectiveness without more concrete proof.
   - **Attractive (Neutral)**: It’s mildly attractive due to its directness but doesn’t spark strong interest given my reserved and somewhat skeptical nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend** (Low score of 2): Even though the issue is acknowledged, the ad lacks compelling reasons for immediate action.
   - **Try** (Moderate score of 3): I might give it a try if available locally, driven by curiosity but not strong desire.
   - **Consider** (Slightly higher at 4): The product warrants consideration due to potential benefits against everyday fatigue and low confidence levels in existing energy solutions.

Overall, while the ad effectively identifies an issue, its execution leaves room for improvement. I’m moderately inclined to consider or try it, but not strongly convinced enough to purchase outright without further information or validation.
