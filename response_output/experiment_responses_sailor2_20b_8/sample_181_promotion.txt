**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (5/7):** While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my generally neutral sociability and focus on practical benefits.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** It's mildly intriguing but not exceptionally compelling given my personality traits.
   - **Good (6/7):** The message is well-articulated for its target audience, making it decently persuasive, especially considering the health-conscious trends in Southeast Asia.
   - **Attractive (5/7):** The ad is visually appealing and motivational, but doesnâ€™t create a strong emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (3/7):** Although I appreciate staying energized for work productivity, my budget constraints and current product satisfaction make an immediate purchase unlikely.
   - **Try to buy (2/7):** Not highly inclined due to financial limits but slightly open to trying if it aligns with personal health goals in the future.
   - **Consider buying (3/7):** There is a moderate consideration, influenced by the potential benefits and my helpful nature towards maintaining well-being; however, practicality and current needs take precedence.

This balanced evaluation reflects both appreciation for healthy lifestyle appeals and pragmatic considerations.
