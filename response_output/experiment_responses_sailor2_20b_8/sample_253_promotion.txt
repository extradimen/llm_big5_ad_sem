**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) — Given my reserved nature, the ad doesn't strongly appeal to me.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (2) — The claims seem standard without any unique selling points that captivate me.
   - **Good:** Agree (4) — While not groundbreaking, it appears well-presented and truthful.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) — It’s okay but lacks emotional resonance or excitement.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Somewhat Agree (5)
     - Despite reservations about the ad itself, I value health benefits.
   - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Agrees with Reservations (6)
     - Will try if others recommend; still cautious due to my thorough approach and tendency towards self-care.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (7)
     - The product aligns with staying energized, which is important. Despite being careful, I'm willing to explore it.

Overall, while the ad doesn't light me up, its promise of energy and wellness prompts consideration and a genuine intent to purchase if consistent benefits are seen.
