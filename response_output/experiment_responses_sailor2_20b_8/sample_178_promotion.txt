**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 2*  
   - As a blue-collar worker who is not particularly outgoing or talkative and prefers practicality over flashy appeals, I find this ad slightly unappealing due to its focus on superficial benefits (energized and looking best).
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 3*  
   - The concept of staying energized sounds promising for someone with a demanding job like mine, but it doesn't grab my attention enough given other daily priorities.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4*  
   - While I appreciate its intended benefits, they donâ€™t resonate strongly in comparison to more pressing needs such as reliability and price.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3*  
   - The presentation might appeal visually but lacks emotional engagement for me; it feels a bit superficial given my current financial constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1*  
   - Given the higher costs associated with such products and my limited budget, I have no immediate intent to buy it.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 2*  
   - There's a slight curiosity if it actually delivers on its promises but not enough motivation to actively seek out purchase options due to affordability concerns.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3*  
   - While I'm open-minded, my financial limitations and prioritization of essential needs mean that considering the purchase would be a distant thought at best.

Overall, while acknowledging potential benefits, practicality and budget constraints heavily influence these scores, leading to moderate interest without strong intent to buy.
