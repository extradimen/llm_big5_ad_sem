**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - While being outgoing and sociable, I find some appeal in catchy ads but it doesn't strongly engage me.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 4 (Slightly Agree)* 
   - It’s attention-grabbing due to health-related concerns, yet not profoundly intriguing.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 2 (Disagree) *
   - The messaging feels somewhat exaggerated and lacks strong credibility for me.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* 
   - Given my tendency to be a bit careless with marketing claims, it doesn’t stand out as genuinely appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree) *
   - The ad’s persuasion isn't compelling enough for an immediate buy decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree) *
   - My careful nature makes me skeptical, so I wouldn’t actively seek it out unless convinced otherwise.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3 (Neutral) *
   - While my strong tendency to worry might make me reflect on energy drinks, the current ad doesn't sway a concrete decision; still open to considering in future situations.
   
Overall, while acknowledging its preventive angle, I'm guarded due to mistrust and cautious nature. Hence, low scores for engagement but some openness towards consideration given personal health concerns.
