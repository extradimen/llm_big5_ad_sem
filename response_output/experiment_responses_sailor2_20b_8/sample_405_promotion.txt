**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad:** My outgoing and sociable nature might appreciate an energetic promise, but my strong agreeance to being sometimes rude means I expect more realism or relatability. Hence, a moderate score of 2.
  - **Interesting:** The appeal of staying energized aligns with personal productivity (do thorough job), so it's somewhat interesting: Score 3.
  - **Believe the ad is good:** While helpful and original tendencies lean towards trust in such claims, my strong distrust in general makes this cautious—score 4.
  - **Attractive:** The active imagination and creativity pull me towards innovative health products, but emotional instability dampens immediate attraction; score 5.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** My managerial responsibilities require focus on efficiency (do a thorough job), making it likely I'd consider such an energizer—score 6.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** High intention due to the perceived benefits and my active imagination pushing me towards innovative solutions, score 7.
  - **Consider buying this product:** Even though emotionally unstable moments could sway decisions elsewhere, overall interest (original ideas) keeps consideration high; thus, score 6. 

Combining all these elements results in a balanced evaluation of moderate attraction to the ad but strong potential for purchase intent given its alignment with productivity and personal health goals.
