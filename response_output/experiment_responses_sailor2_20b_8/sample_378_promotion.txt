**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 6 (Strongly Agree)*  
   The energy and appearance benefits are appealing given my busy lifestyle as an office worker.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 5 (Agree)*  
   It's engaging, but not groundbreaking for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 4.5 (Slightly Agree)*  
   While I find it persuasive, there’s room to doubt without clear evidence or testimonials.

4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 4 (Neutral/Agree)**  
   It's visually appealing but doesn't grab my attention intensely due to over-saturation of similar ads in Southeast Asia.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 2.5 (Disagree)*  
   High price range and lack of strong trust might prevent immediate action.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 3 (Neutral)**  
   If it’s on sale or recommended by a trusted friend, I'd consider giving it a shot.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 3.5 (Slightly Agree)*  
   Given my supportive and forward-thinking nature, especially around self-care, the idea of trying isn't entirely off-putting.

**Summary**: The ad is moderately appealing but lacks compelling evidence to drive a strong purchase intention. It's intriguing enough for me to consider buying if circumstances align positively or reviews are favorable. As someone who values health benefits and appearance, I'm not completely closed-off; hence the balanced scores reflect my cautious yet open approach.
