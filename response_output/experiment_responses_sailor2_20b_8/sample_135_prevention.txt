**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Like the Ad (2)**:
   - I am a bit reserved, so while not strongly opposed, it's neutral to slightly negative because of its assertive tone.

2. **Interesting (3)**:
   - Neutral as it touches on common fatigue issues but doesn't captivate me with creativity or novelty.

3. **Good Advertisement (4)**:
   - Agree since addressing tiredness and appearance is relevant for many, including myself.

4. **Attractive (3)**:
   - Slightly neutral because the appeal falls short due to my tendency towards carelessness in prioritizing self-care products.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to Purchase (5)**:
   - Agree; it addresses real concerns and aligns with occasional fatigue experienced during long work hours, prompting some consideration.

2. **Try to Buy (6)**:
   - Strongly Agree due to my generally trusting nature regarding health/well-being products and the practical benefits they offer.

3. **Consider Buying (7)**:
   - Strongly Consider; despite not always being thorough or following through with plans, the adâ€™s message nudges me towards thinking it might genuinely improve daily performance without significant emotional stress from high expectations. 

Overall, while my attitude is moderately positive and critical, strong product relevance combined with a tendency for spontaneity pushes me to seriously consider trying this drink despite not fully loving the advertisement itself.
