**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score 3* - Neutral; As a reserved individual with some anxiety and emotional instability (Strongly Disagree for emotionally stable), I find it neither particularly appealing nor unappealing.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score 2* - Somewhat Disagree; My preference leans towards routine and predictable content, finding this more generic than engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score 4* - Neutral to Slightly Agree; It appears credible but does not strongly resonate due to my tendency toward practicality rather than energetic promises.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score 3* - Neutral; The promise of staying energized and looking best sounds positive, yet it doesn't captivate me significantly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Given my budget constraints (<15 million VND monthly) and cautious nature, an expensive wellness drink seems unnecessary.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score 1* - Strongly Disagree; There's no motivation or urgency driven by the ad to make a trial purchase.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score 2 (Somewhat Agree)* - While not strongly considered, if health concerns arise and within budget constraints, I might entertain the idea but only after thorough scrutiny.

Overall, while open-minded towards healthy living tips, practical considerations and personal dispositions lead to a neutral-to-negative attitude with low purchase intentions.
