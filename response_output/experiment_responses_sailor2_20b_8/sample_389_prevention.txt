**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (3)** - Neutral but slightly positive; it aligns with my desire for practical benefits without strong emotional appeal or dislike.
2. **Interesting (4)** - Agree, because the message directly addresses fatigue and appearance concerns which are relevant to a busy office worker like me.
3. **Good (5)** - Strongly agree due to its clear focus on health/well-being impacts—important aspects for my life stage and responsibilities.
4. **Attractive (2)** - Disagree; while the content is valuable, it lacks the creativity or visual impact that would make it truly attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase** (3): I'm inclined but not fully committed yet due to personal preference for thorough decision-making and cautious nature.
2. **Will try** (4): There’s a moderate likelihood of giving it a chance, especially considering its potential benefits.
3. **Consider buying** (5): Overall, the product warrants serious consideration; it addresses my need to stay energized and presentable at work.

Balancing criticality with practical utility, this ad effectively appeals to my concerns without fully captivating me visually or emotionally. Nonetheless, I see value in testing its efficacy through a trial purchase.
