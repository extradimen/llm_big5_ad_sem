**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **Like (Score 3):** Given my reserved and sometimes nervous nature, I find the ad somewhat pleasant but not particularly engaging or exciting.
  - **Interesting (Score 4):** It captures a basic idea of energy boost and appearance improvement; however, it doesn't spark much curiosity in me.
  - **Good (Score 5):** The message is clear and generally positive. While I appreciate the sentiment, its appeal falls short due to my cautious nature.
  - **Attractive (Score 2):** As a reserved individual who gets nervous easily, I don’t find it visually or emotionally compelling enough.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Score of 1 – Despite understanding the benefits, personal preferences and financial constraints make this unlikely.
  - **Try to buy:** Score of 3 – There's a slight inclination to test due to its claims but not strong enough to take action right away.
  - **Consider buying:** Score of 2 – While I'm open to considering it if circumstances change or reviews improve, the immediate appeal isn't there.

In summary, while I see value in what the ad promotes, my reserved personality and practical financial considerations steer me towards a low purchase intent. The messaging is decent but falls short of compelling for someone like myself.
