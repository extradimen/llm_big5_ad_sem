**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (6/7):** As a talkative and outgoing individual who values staying energized, I find it appealing.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral to positive interest level due to its straightforward message on energy and appearance.
     * Score = 5/7
   - **Good quality/advertising effort:** Slightly lower score as the general trust isn't enough to elevate this ad above average.
     * Score = 4.5/7
   - **Attractive:** While I appreciate attractiveness, it falls short in capturing my attention given more practical aspects of life.
     * Score = 3/7

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Despite liking the idea, personal budget constraints and daily routines mean a strong intention is not high.
     * Score = 2/7
   - **Try to buy:** I might be inclined to give it a try if available at an affordable price or during special offers.
     * Score = 3/7
   - **Consider buying:** Given the product aligns with staying energized, there's enough curiosity and consideration for future use without immediate urgency.
     * Score = 4/7

Overall, while the ad resonates positively due to its straightforward benefits, my practical considerations (budget, daily routine) impact a strong purchase intention. Nonetheless, it remains an appealing option that I would consider in certain contexts.
