**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad**: 
   - *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
     - While I appreciate being energetic and looking good, my strong inclination toward practicality and thoroughness makes me neutral about the advertisement.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**:
   - *Score: 4 (Somewhat Agree)*
     - The idea of staying energized appeals to daily challenges but it's not enough to captivate me fully given my reserved nature and preference for direct messages over flashy claims.

3. **I believe the ad is good**:
   - *Score: 2 (Disagree)* 
     - Lack of specific, credible evidence or personal benefits tailored to my lifestyle reduces its perceived value. The generic appeal feels somewhat superficial.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: 
   - *Score: 5 (Somewhat Agree)*
     - It's visually pleasing and resonates with some aspects of self-care; however, it doesn't fully align with my practical priorities.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**:
   - *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
     - Although the message is appealing, my financial constraints ($16M-25M VND/month), along with a preference for cost-effective solutions, make an immediate intent unlikely.

2. **I will try to buy this product**:
   - *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
     - Given limited disposable income and other priorities, actively seeking out or trying the drink feels low on my priority list without compelling reasons or discounts.

3. **I will consider buying it**:
   - *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)**
     - While I'm not completely dismissive due to its potential benefits, current circumstances mean considering purchasing is quite far from reality at this time.

Overall, the ad has some engaging elements but falls short in terms of personal relevance and practicality for my lifestyle. Therefore, purchase intent remains minimal despite a neutral-to-positive attitude towards the advertisement's aesthetics and message.
