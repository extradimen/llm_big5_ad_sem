**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (4/7)**: Neutral to slightly agree; it's not particularly exciting but isn't disliked either.
  - **Interesting (5/7)**: It piques some interest due to energy and appearance benefits, which are relevant for my age group.
  - **Good (6/7)**: Generally positive as the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my values on health and self-care.
  - **Attractive (5/7)**: Neutral leaning towards agree; visually appealing can matter, but it’s not a strong draw alone.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**: Moderate intention due to practical benefits despite some skepticism about overpromises.
  - **Will try to buy the product. (2/7)**: Low; cautious approach since I’m budget-conscious and need verifiable efficacy.
  - **Consider buying it. (3/7)**: Considering, but not immediately compelling enough without more concrete evidence or discounts.

In summary, while finding the ad appealing on a conceptual level, my inclination to purchase is balanced by practical considerations like price, reliability of claims, and personal needs. It's an interesting option worth considering, but not a guaranteed buy yet.
