**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad (4/7): Disagree slightly; resonates but doesnâ€™t excite.
  - The ad is interesting (5/7): Neutral-leaning Agree; finds some intrigue in preventing fatigue and dullness, albeit not groundbreaking.
  - It's a good ad (3/7): Slightly disagree; lacks strong emotional connection or convincing power for me.
  - I find the ad attractive (2/7): Strongly Disagree; it feels generic without compelling visuals or messaging to draw attention.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (1/7): Strongly Disagree. Despite acknowledging its benefits, no strong motivation to buy.
  - Will try to buy the product (2/7): Disagree slightly; open but not inclined to make a concerted effort.
  - Consider buying the product (3/7): Neutral; might be considered in future if necessity arises or reviews are positive.

Overall, while recognizing its preventive benefits, my personality and current situation do not drive strong interest or immediate purchase intent. The ad resonates moderately at best but falls short of compelling me to act.
