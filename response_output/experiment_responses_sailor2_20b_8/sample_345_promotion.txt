**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 3)**: I find it somewhat appealing but not strongly so. The energizing aspect aligns with my busy lifestyle as a postgraduate student, yet it feels rather generic.
    - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It piques interest to some extent due to its promise of daily energy and looking good, especially for someone like me who values staying active.
    - **Good (Score: 2)**: The messaging is effective at a basic level but lacks depth or specificity about how the drink achieves these benefits. This neutralizes my enthusiasm.
    - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: It holds moderate visual and emotional attractiveness, especially if it's well-designed with eye-catching visuals—though not enough to be compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score: 1)**: I'm not inclined to buy right away due to mixed feelings about the ad’s credibility and lack of detailed product information.
    - **Try (Score: 2)**: I might consider sampling if offered a trial or discount, as curiosity can be piqued by such promises.
    - **Consider (Score: 3)**: The promise resonates enough for me to keep it in mind when looking for an energy drink. Further information could sway my decision positively.

Overall, the ad captures some attention but doesn't inspire a strong purchase intent immediately due to its generic nature and lack of detailed benefits or proof points. I value specifics more than vague claims, especially given my demanding academic schedule. However, it does open room for further consideration if additional compelling evidence is provided.
