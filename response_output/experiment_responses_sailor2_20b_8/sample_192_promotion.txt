- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score 5) - The promise of staying energized resonates but lacks exceptional uniqueness given current market trends.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score 4) - Neutral to slightly positive; it effectively communicates benefits, though not groundbreaking for this category.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score 3) - While visually engaging, its overall attractiveness falls short compared to competitorsâ€™ more striking ads.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score 2) - The appeal is moderate; I'm open but not strongly compelled based on current needs.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score 1) - Low intention due to other options and the lack of standout features compelling enough for a trial purchase.
