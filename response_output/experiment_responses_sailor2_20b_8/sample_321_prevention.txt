**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) – While the ad's messaging isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative, it resonates moderately.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – The concept of addressing fatigue is intriguing, given my focus on studies and productivity.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) – It effectively communicates a clear need for energy enhancement in everyday life, which aligns with managing stress from being a postgraduate student.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – My reserved personality finds the directness of "Without this drink..." somewhat pushy and less appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Agree (4) – The ad's claims about preventing tiredness are convincing, but I'm cautious due to personal preference for natural remedies.
   - **Try to Buy:** Agree (4.5) – There’s enough motivation to give it a trial run, particularly if the product offers noticeable benefits without significant side effects.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5) – Given my consistent work ethic and desire for efficiency in studies, considering this product aligns with maintaining focus and energy levels.

In summary, while I appreciate the ad's clarity on addressing fatigue, its overt approach isn't ideal. However, practical benefits outweigh initial reservations, making me likely to consider or even try purchasing the product based on potential improvements in productivity and well-being.
