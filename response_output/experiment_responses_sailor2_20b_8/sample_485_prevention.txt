   - **I believe the ad is good:** *Score 4 (Agree)* – The message is clear and relevant to daily life; however, its simplicity doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** *Score 5 (Agree)* – It appeals visually but falls short in emotional appeal or creative depth.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score 6 (Strongly Agree)* – The potential benefits align with my health and appearance concerns, encouraging a positive consideration.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** *Score 4 (Agree)* – There's enough interest to prompt a trial, especially as it addresses common issues related to daily stress.
