**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
   - **Like the ad:** 3 — Neutral; I don't feel strongly either way.
   - **Interesting:** 4 — Agree; The concept of feeling tired and looking dull resonates slightly.
   - **Good:** 2 — Disagree; While it's not terrible, the overall appeal is lacking for me.
   - **Attractive:** 1 — Strongly Disagree; It doesn't attract me due to personal discomfort with its message.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** 3 — Neutral; The ad sparks mild interest but isn’t compelling enough on its own.
   - **Will try to buy:** 3 — Agree; If the product aligns well with my lifestyle and has other appealing factors, I might give it a shot.
   - **Consider buying:** 4 — Slightly Agree; There’s room for consideration based on additional information or reviews.

Overall, while the ad highlights relevant concerns (tiredness and appearance), its execution lacks personal appeal given my personality traits. However, there's potential for cautious interest if supplemented with more trustworthy details about the product itself.
