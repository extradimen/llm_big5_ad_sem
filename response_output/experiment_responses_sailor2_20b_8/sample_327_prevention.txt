**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 

   - **Like (Score: 4)**: I find aspects of the ad appealing, particularly its focus on alleviating tiredness and improving appearance. However, it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The concept is intriguing but not groundbreaking; it aligns well with common product claims.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: I appreciate the message's clarity and relevance to everyday life, making it generally effective in communicating its benefits.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While visually presentable, the ad lacks an emotional connection for me, feeling a bit formulaic.

- **Purchase Intention**:

   - **Intend to Purchase**: Although I understand the appeal and necessity of such products, my current financial situation doesn't allow me to prioritize it at this time (Score: 2).
   - **Try to Buy**: Given limited income (<15 million VND), trying out a potentially expensive product isnâ€™t feasible for now (Score: 1).
   - **Consider Buying**: The ad makes the idea of buying this drink worth contemplating in the future when budget allows, balancing practicality with potential benefits (Score: 3).

Overall, while the advertisement effectively communicates its purpose and is well-crafted, my current lifestyle constraints lead me to a more reserved approach towards purchasing.
