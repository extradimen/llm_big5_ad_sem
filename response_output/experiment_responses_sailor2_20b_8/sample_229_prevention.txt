**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like (Score: 4):** While I appreciate the message about avoiding fatigue and dullness, it doesn't fully captivate me due to my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3):** The ad's premise is clear but lacks novelty; it feels somewhat generic.
  - **Good (Score: 5):** As a civil servant with high stress levels, the idea of boosting energy and appearance resonates moderately. However, the credibility depends on the product’s effectiveness.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** The overall design or presentation is not very appealing to me; it needs more creativity.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend (Score: 6):** Given my high-stress job and desire for enhanced focus, I lean toward purchasing the product despite reservations.
  - **Try (Score: 4):** Curiosity is there but not overwhelming enough to push immediate action; a trial would be considered first.
  - **Consider (Score: 5):** It aligns with my needs, so it's in the serious consideration list. My tendency towards thoroughness and trust influences this decision.

In summary, while I find the ad decently persuasive due to its practical benefits for my lifestyle, there’s room for improvement in creativity and appeal. Nevertheless, the product holds potential value, leading me toward a likely purchase intent after further evaluation or trial use.
