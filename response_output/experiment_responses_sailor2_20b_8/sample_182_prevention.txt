**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 4) - While I appreciate its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance, it lacks a personal connection or emotional depth that resonates with my values.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3.5) - The content isn't particularly engaging; it feels generic and could be more innovative to stand out in such a crowded market.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 3) - It conveys its message effectively but lacks strong evidence or testimonials, making me question the product's genuine benefits.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2.5) - The visual appeal and overall presentation are lacking; an impactful image or creative storytelling could make it more compelling.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Given my strong agreement with thoroughness in work, I prioritize evidence-based products over mere claims. Without clear proof of effectiveness, intent is low.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1.5) - There's a slight curiosity driven by the ad’s messaging, but it doesn't align enough with my typical decision-making process which emphasizes reliability and research.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 1) - Despite being somewhat open to new options, I am unlikely to seriously consider purchasing due to lack of trust in the advertisement's persuasiveness.

Overall, while I acknowledge its aim to address common issues like tiredness and appearance, the ad fails to create a compelling connection for me. It lacks credibility, emotional engagement, and sufficient proof of efficacy—elements crucial for my decision-making process as someone prioritizing reliability over mere marketing claims. Thus, low purchase intention scores reflect this assessment.
