**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3)
   - While energy drinks appeal to my need for staying energized as an office worker, the phrase "look your best" feels superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me given that I'm focused more on practicality rather than appearance.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score = 4)
   - The concept of maintaining energy levels throughout the day interests me but it could be presented in a way that connects better to my values, such as highlighting productivity over aesthetics.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral-to-Agree (Score = 5)
   - The message has potential; however, I'd need more trust-building elements like scientific backing or customer testimonials to fully validate its claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly Negative (Score = 2)
   - Although visually appealing ads can be effective, this one’s emphasis on vanity distracts from my focus areas as someone who values thorough work and efficiency over superficial appearance.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Unlikely (Score = 2)
   - While the idea is intriguing, it doesn't align perfectly with my priorities or current budget constraints ($<15,000,000 VND monthly).

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Very Low Intent (Score = 1.5) 
   - My reservations about the ad's messaging and limited funds make an active attempt at purchase unlikely.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Mild Consideration (Score = 3)
   - There’s a small chance of consideration, especially if there are compelling offers or reviews that address my concerns regarding effectiveness without focusing excessively on superficial aspects.

Overall, the ad has mixed appeal—interesting but not entirely convincing for regular purchase given its messaging and alignment with personal values. Further refinement could enhance relevance to consumers like myself.
