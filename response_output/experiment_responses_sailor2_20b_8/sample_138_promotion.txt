**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)** - While not strongly disliked, I find it somewhat appealing due to its direct message about energy and appearance.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The claim of staying energized is relatable for someone in my age group balancing studies and activities.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - It effectively communicates benefits but doesn't stand out as groundbreaking, just solid.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - Despite the catchy promise, it feels slightly generic without much personal connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; the adâ€™s content resonates but doesn't drive immediate action given my budget constraints and cautious nature.
2. **Try to Buy (Score: 1)** - Also strongly disagree due to financial limitations and preference for tried-and-tested products.
3. **Consider Buying (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards agree; I might think about it if the price is right or there are reviews supporting its efficacy, but overall not a top priority.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance, my reserved nature, budgetary concerns, and preference for reliable information over flashy promises make this ad less compelling. A strong performance on practicality would be required to turn intent into action.
