**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like (2/7):** Given my reserved nature and generally neutral social tendencies, I don't find the ad overly engaging.
  - **Interesting (3/7):** The concept of staying energized resonates slightly but doesn’t spark high interest due to a lack of strong emotional connection or personal relevance.
  - **Good (4/7):** It's well-intentioned and presents clear benefits, aligning with my helpful personality. However, it lacks depth that would make me strongly agree.
  - **Attractive (3/7):** The appearance is decent but doesn't captivate me; I prefer more substantive appeals.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (1/7):** As a civil servant living with parents and focused on reliability, everyday purchases need practical justification. This ad’s promise of "looking best" feels superficial.
  - **Try the Product (2/7):** I might entertain sampling it if recommended by someone trustworthy but not actively seek it out.
  - **Consider Buying (3/7):** There's a moderate consideration due to its claimed functional benefits, especially for energy. However, other practical considerations will heavily influence my final decision.

Overall, while the ad is serviceable and aligns with some of my traits (e.g., thoroughness, helpful nature), it doesn't sufficiently address my cautious and reserved persona or adequately justify a strong purchasing intent given my financial responsibilities and lifestyle priorities.
