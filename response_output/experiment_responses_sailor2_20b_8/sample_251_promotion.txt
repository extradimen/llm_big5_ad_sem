**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score = 5)**: The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing; however, my reserved nature means I'm not overly enthusiastic about it.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4)**: While engaging enough to capture attention, it doesn't fully resonate with me due to personal priorities over such marketing claims.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score = 3)**: Neutral leaning towards skepticism because I'm not naturally trusting and prefer more detailed evidence beyond just a catchy slogan. 
- **I find the ad attractive (Score = 6)**: Visually, it may be appealing, but practical considerations slightly lower its overall attractiveness.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2)**: While tempted by health and appearance benefits, my strong agreement with "tend to be careless" means I'm less likely to commit without further research or personal need.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1)**: Low intention; the ad's persuasion is not compelling enough against my generally careful spending habits and skepticism.
- **I will consider buying it (Score = 2)**: Though not highly motivated, I'm open to considering it if circumstances or other factors align with my needs.

In summary, while there are positive aspects in terms of attractiveness and interest, the overall ad doesn't fully connect emotionally nor drive strong purchase intent given my background and personality traits. Critical thinking and cautious nature prevail here.
