**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (2):** Disagree; The appeal doesn't resonate strongly with me.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (3):** Neutral to Slightly Agree; It holds some attention but lacks compelling engagement.
   - **I believe the ad is good (4):** Moderate Agreement; While it's not perfect, I see its effectiveness in conveying a preventive message.
   - **I find the ad attractive (3):** Neutral to Mild Attraction; The visual and messaging are acceptable but not striking enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (5):** Agree; Though cautious, I might be inclined due to its promise of preventing tiredness.
   - **Will try to buy this product (6):** Strong Agreement; Given my generally supportive approach and need for energy, it feels like a reasonable trial option.
   - **Will consider buying the product (5):** Moderate Consideration; Despite personal reservations on advertising style, I'm open-minded about its potential benefits.

Overall, while there are mild to moderate positive responses to both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention, they reflect an approach grounded in practicality over emotional appeal. The prevention-focused message aligns with my need for efficiency, but improvements could enhance persuasiveness further.
