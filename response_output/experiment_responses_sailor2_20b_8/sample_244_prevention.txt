**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitudes (7-point scale):**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (score of 5) - While I appreciate its straightforward messaging about fatigue and appearance, it feels somewhat over-the-top.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly agree (4) - It’s attention-grabbing but could be more engaging with creative elements or personal stories.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral leaning slightly negative (3.5) - The claims are effective, yet I wish for stronger evidence of product benefits and less fear-mongering.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Negative (2.5) - The visual appeal could be improved; it seems more like a marketing warning rather than an enticing pitch.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Low intent (score of 2) - Even though I understand its relevance, there are other factors (like cost and brand trust) that need addressing.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat lower intent (2.5) - Curiosity piqued but not enough motivation based on the ad alone.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Very low consideration (1.5) - The decision hinges more on personal needs, budget constraints, and reviews beyond what’s presented in the advertisement.

Overall, while I recognize its preventive messaging value, additional compelling details or a more relatable approach would significantly enhance both my attitude toward the ad and intention to purchase the product.
