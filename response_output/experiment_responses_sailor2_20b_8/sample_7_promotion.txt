**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (3): Neutral. The claim of staying energized and looking good is relevant but not particularly compelling given my reserved nature.
   - I think the ad is interesting (2): Disagree. It lacks novelty or depth for me, especially considering my strong disinterest in being sociable and outgoing.
   - I believe the ad is good (4): Slightly Agree. The message seems straightforward and somewhat useful, but not particularly convincing to resonate with my personality traits.
   - I find the ad attractive (2): Disagree. It does not align well with my values or personal style; hence, it feels unappealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly Disagree. The lack of strong emotional connection and relevance makes me unlikely to make a deliberate decision.
   - I will try to buy this product (2): Neutral leaning toward Disagree. There is no compelling enough reason for trial based on the ad's presentation.
   - I will consider buying it (3): Slightly Agree. Although not strongly influenced, the potential benefit of staying energized could be a low-priority consideration during my shopping decisions.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional benefits, this advertisement does not sufficiently engage or persuade me due to personality mismatches and lack of emotional resonance. Thus, the intention scores reflect minimal interest in purchasing despite recognizing some utility.
