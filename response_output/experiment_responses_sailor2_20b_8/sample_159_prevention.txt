**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale)**:
   - **Like**: I have a somewhat positive feeling toward the ad (4) because it addresses common concerns about energy levels and appearance.
   - **Interesting**: It grabs my attention to some extent as fatigue is relevant, making me view it as moderately interesting (5).
   - **Good**: The message appears credible but lacks strong emotional appeal or unique value propositions for full endorsement; thus, I rate it a 6 out of 7.
   - **Attractive**: While the ad's concept may be decently presented, its overall attractiveness to me is lower due to personal preference and lack of excitement (3).

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - **Intend to purchase**: Despite being moderately intrigued by the potential benefits against tiredness and dull appearance, I'm not strongly motivated to buy right away (2).
   - **Will try**: The ad does pique curiosity enough for a trial if circumstances align (4), showing some inclination towards testing it.
   - **Consider buying**:** Overall, I am open to considering the product when needed, influenced by its relevance but without strong urgency or emotional pull (4).

This evaluation reflects my preference for practicality and directness over exaggerated claims. While acknowledging potential benefits, my cautious nature due to thorough job habits doesnâ€™t translate directly into high purchase intent, hence balanced scores across both attitude and intention scales.
