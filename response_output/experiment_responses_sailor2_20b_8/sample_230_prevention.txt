**Evaluation and Rationale:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** Scored `2` (Neutral). The message about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance appeals to some extent but lacks personal resonance.
2. **Interesting:** Scored `3` (Disagree slightly). While it presents a clear issue, its straightforward nature doesnâ€™t hold my attention significantly.
3. **Believe is good:** Scored `2` (Neutral). The ad's claim seems basic and predictable, failing to stand out with new or compelling information.
4. **Attractive:** Scored `1` (Strongly Disagree). Given my reserved personality and tendency towards emotional instability, the imagery or messaging doesn't create an appealing impression.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Scored `1` (Strongly Disagree). Although aware of needing energy, other factors like trust issues and a lackluster ad impact negatively on my intent.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Scored `1` (Strongly Disagree). The low engagement with the ad reduces the likelihood of any trial purchase despite occasional need for boosts.
3. **Consider buying this product:** Scored `2` (Neutral). There's a small chance I might consider it under specific circumstances but not driven by current ad appeal.

Overall, while acknowledging the practical issue highlighted in the ad, its execution doesn't align well with my personality and preferences, leading to minimal persuasive impact on both attitude and purchase intention.
