**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (score=3):** I appreciate the straightforward message but find it a bit generic.
  - **Interesting (score=4):** The idea of preventing fatigue is intriguing enough to engage briefly.
  - **Good (score=5):** It has some credibility in highlighting common concerns, although not exceptionally well-crafted.
  - **Attractive (score=2):** My reserved nature and strong tendency towards caution make me feel the ad lacks personal appeal or emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my cautious personality and limited budget, I'm unlikely to commit without further evidence of efficacy.
  - **Try to Buy:** There's a neutral inclination to give it a shot if recommended by someone trustworthy (due to general trust).
  - **Consider Buying:** Despite some skepticism, the appeal to avoid tiredness aligns with my practical side, making me open to consideration but not immediate action.

Overall, while I recognize its relevance and effectiveness message, personal traits like reserved nature and financial constraints mean I won't rush into purchasing. Thus, moderately positive attitudes toward the ad without high purchase intent.
