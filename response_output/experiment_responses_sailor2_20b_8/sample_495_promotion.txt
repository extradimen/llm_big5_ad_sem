**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4)  
     Neutral leaning towards positive; it aligns with my preference for energy and appearance but lacks a strong emotional connection.
   
   - *Interesting.* (Score: 5)  
     It piques interest, especially since staying energized is beneficial. However, additional detail could make it more engaging.

   - *Good.* (Score: 6)  
     The message is clear and well-intentioned but needs stronger proof points to fully convince me of its effectiveness.
   
   - *Attractive.* (Score: 3)  
     While the concept appeals to my need for energy, I find it slightly superficial in presentation; more depth would enhance attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intentions:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2)  
     There is a slight inclination due to practical benefits but not enough conviction yet.
   
   - *Will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3)  
     A tentative step towards trying it, as the claims are reasonable and align with my lifestyle needs.

   - *Will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4)  
     Overall, I am open to considering based on balanced personal values for energy and appearance but would like more credibility before making a decision. 

**Summary:** The advertisement resonates partially due to its practical benefits but falls short in emotional engagement and convincing evidence. It is worth consideration but not yet compelling enough for immediate purchase or strong intent. More substantiated claims and an appealing presentation could enhance both attitude scores and purchase intentions.
