**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** 3 — The advertisement's claim feels somewhat exaggerated but not entirely off.
  - **Interesting:** 2 — It does not captivate my attention much; it seems generic and overused.
  - **Good:** 4 — While decent in terms of conveying a message, it lacks originality or emotional connection.
  - **Attractive:** 1 — I find the ad unappealing due to its clichéd messaging.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** 2 — Not high; I'm skeptical about the need for such a drink given my lifestyle and health routines.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** 3 — Mild curiosity, but not strong enough motivation to actually make an effort.
  - **Consider buying this product:** 2 — Minimal consideration since it doesn't resonate with me personally or address significant concerns.

In summary, while the ad is marginally effective in communicating a benefit (preventing tiredness and dull appearance), my cautious nature and general skepticism lower its appeal significantly. Consequently, my purchase intentions are subdued due to lack of personal relevance and credibility.
