**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **Like:** While I appreciate its focus on health and well-being (Agree), being reserved means this ad style isn't my favorite format—slightly neutral leaning towards mild liking.
   - **Interesting:** The preventive message is intriguing, especially for a postgraduate office worker who values thoroughness but doesn’t find it overwhelmingly engaging (Neutral to Agree).
   - **Good:** Credibility comes from addressing common fatigue and appearance concerns; thus, I perceive the ad as generally good due to its relevance.
   - **Attractive:** The straightforward message is appealing, though not exceptionally so for my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Although I don’t strongly intend to buy (5), it's a reasonable consideration given concerns about performance and appearance at work.
   - **Try:** Given the potential benefits, I’m inclined to give the product a try if available locally but not compelled enough for an immediate purchase (4).
   - **Consider:** The ad definitely nudges me towards considering this option as part of maintaining my daily routine; hence, it receives a higher score (6).

Overall, while the advertisement effectively resonates with preventive health concerns and aligns well with my values of thoroughness and being unselfish to maintain my physical state, its impact is balanced by my reserved nature and cautious approach towards new purchases.
