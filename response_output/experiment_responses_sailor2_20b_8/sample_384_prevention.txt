**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (2/7):**
   - Despite being a reserved individual who doesn't typically engage with talkative or outgoing content, I find it superficially appealing due to its claim of combating tiredness.
   
2. **Interesting (3/7):** 
   - The concept is somewhat intriguing as staying energized and looking fresh are desirable outcomes. However, my minimal interaction tendencies mean it's not highly captivating.

3. **Good (4/7):**
   - On a neutral to slightly positive note, the message aligns with common health concerns but lacks deeper emotional or logical engagement for me.
   
4. **Attractive (1/7):** 
   - The ad feels manipulative and somewhat irrelevant considering my reserved nature; I'm not drawn visually or emotionally by such direct messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (2/7):**
   - While the benefits appeal, my trust issues with marketing claims combined with a tendency towards caution make me unlikely to plan an immediate purchase.
   
2. **Try to buy (2/7):** 
   - I might consider testing it if prompted by other credible sources or personal need but without strong intention.

3. **Consider buying (1/7):**
   - The low score here reflects my general skepticism and preference for more thorough research before making purchases, especially since the ad alone isn't compelling enough to sway me significantly. 

Overall, while recognizing its potential benefits, the advertisement fails to resonate deeply with my reserved nature, lack of social engagement tendencies, and cautious consumer behavior. Therefore, it earns a mixed but generally low score on both attitude and purchase intention scales.
