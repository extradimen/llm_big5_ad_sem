**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** My talkative and generally agreeable nature means I appreciate persuasive ads, but the specific claim of preventing tiredness/dull appearance feels somewhat generic—thus a moderate score (2).
   - **Interesting:** Neutral because while not boring, it lacks novelty or personal appeal for me.
   - **Good:** Given my strong agreement on thorough work and trustworthiness, if I perceive credibility in the product's benefits, I believe this ad is good (4).
   - **Attractive:** The message doesn't resonate emotionally with my personality traits; hence a low score (2).

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Despite finding it somewhat credible, actual purchasing intent isn’t high because of other life priorities and current financial constraints.
   - **Try to buy:** Neutral—open to sampling if offered during special promotions or discounts.
   - **Consider buying:** Strongly agree due to my tendency towards thoroughness; I might review product reviews and its necessity for daily routine before making a purchase decision. 

Overall, the ad is moderately persuasive but lacks strong emotional appeal matching my personality traits, influencing moderate intent despite potential future consideration.
