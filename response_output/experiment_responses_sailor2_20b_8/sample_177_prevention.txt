**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad**: Neutral (Score = 3) - The phrasing and fear appeal feel somewhat generic.
2. **Interesting**: Agree (Score = 4) - The message about fatigue and appearance is engaging, particularly resonating with my need to stay alert at work.
3. **Good quality ad**: Strongly Agree (Score = 5) - It effectively targets common concerns related to energy levels and self-image.
4. **Attractive**: Disagree (Score = 2) - While informative, the presentation lacks emotional or unique appeal for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: Consider (Score = 3) - Though I see value in combating tiredness, immediate action isn't strong enough.
2. **Will try to buy**: Try (Score = 3) - The message nudges but does not compel an instant purchase; future consideration is likely.
3. **Consider buying**: Strongly Consider (Score = 5) - The persuasive aspects of the ad make it a serious contender in my shopping list.

Overall, while I appreciate the relevance and effectiveness of the ad's messaging, its emotional draw could be stronger to drive immediate action. It effectively gets me thinking about potential benefits but doesn't seal the deal with urgency or excitement for purchase just yet.
