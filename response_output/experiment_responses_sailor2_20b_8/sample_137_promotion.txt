- **I believe the ad is good. (score: 4)**: Mildly positive, recognizing basic effectiveness.
- **I find the ad attractive. (score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; it lacks appeal given my personality and daily priorities.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (score: 2)**: Not inclined due to budget constraints and practicality over appearance/productivity boosts.
