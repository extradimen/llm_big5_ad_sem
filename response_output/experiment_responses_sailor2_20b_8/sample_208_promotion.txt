**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (Score 3):** Neutral; I find it decent but not particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting (Score 4):** Agrees somewhat; It's mildly intriguing given the claims about energy and appearance.
  - **Good (Score 5):** Slightly positive; The message is generally well-crafted, though no strong personal appeal.
  - **Attractive (Score 2):** Disagree slightly; Not visually or emotionally compelling enough for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly disagree (1); My current lifestyle and budget don't align with a regular energy drink expenditure.
  - **Try the product:** Slightly agree (2); If available cheaply, I might give it a try once out of curiosity.
  - **Consider buying:** Neutral/likely consider (3); It could be worth trying under certain circumstances or discounts.

Overall, while appreciating its attempt at relevance and messaging, my lifestyle priorities and financial situation steer me away from making this product a regular purchase. The ad resonates mildly but not enough to drive an immediate or consistent buy-in decision.
