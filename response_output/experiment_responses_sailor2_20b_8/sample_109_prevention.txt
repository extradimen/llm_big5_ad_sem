**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: Neutral to positive; it appeals slightly due to its straightforward messaging but lacks personal connection.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: Agreed, because tiredness is a relatable issue for blue-collar workers, making the message engaging.
   - **Good (Score: 3)**: Somewhat agreeable. The ad effectively targets fatigue and appearance concerns relevant to daily life but feels generic.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards disinterest; could use more creativity or specific benefits for strong appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**: Moderate inclinationâ€”while the ad resonates with my needs, it's not compelling enough to prompt immediate action.
   - **Try to buy this product (Score: 3)**: Balanced; might give it a try if available and affordable given budget constraints.
   - **Consider buying this product (Score: 2)**: Somewhat low; more research or personal recommendation would be needed before making the purchase decision.

Overall, while I understand the ad's relevance to my daily struggles with fatigue, its appeal is limited by generic messaging. The lack of compelling uniqueness and specific health benefits reduces both engagement and immediate purchasing intent despite recognizing the potential utility.
