**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While not strongly disagreeing, I find it somewhat neutral due to its straightforward messaging.
2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but lacks uniqueness; hence a score of 4 for "interesting."
3. **Good**: As someone who values thoroughness in work and dislikes careless approaches, the ad's prevention focus appeals moderately (Score: 2).
4. **Attractive**: Given my tendency to worry about fatigue and appearance, it has some relevance but is not highly engaging; thus a score of 3.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - While acknowledging the concern addressed, I am skeptical about needing an external solution without further evidence.
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Mild curiosity is there but not enough to motivate immediate action; a middle-ground intention score of 2.
3. **Consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - The ad prompts consideration, particularly due to the worry about fatigue and dullness, yet falls short in compelling me strongly.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance for my worries, I find it lacking in creativity and persuasion power compared to other ads targeting similar concerns. Thus, low scores reflect a cautious but not dismissive evaluation.
