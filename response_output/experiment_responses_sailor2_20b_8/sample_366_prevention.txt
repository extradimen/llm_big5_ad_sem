**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) – The persuasive nature of the claim appeals, but personal preferences lean towards other aspects.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – It captures attention by highlighting potential issues if not using the product, making it intriguing.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) – As someone who values thoroughness and health consciousness, the ad's messaging resonates positively.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – Although effective in its message, my reserved nature means I find the emotional appeal less captivating.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (3) – The information is compelling but does not immediately lead to a purchase decision without further exploration.
   - **Try to Buy:** Agree (4) – Given its relevance and my tendency for health, I am open-minded enough to give it a try once convinced by additional factors or usage experience.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5) – It aligns with maintaining personal well-being; thus, serious consideration is given even if not an immediate buy.

Overall, while the advertisement effectively communicates potential benefits and appeals moderately, my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness mean it needs additional factors to seal a purchase. However, it stands strong in terms of being informative and encouraging thoughtful consideration.
