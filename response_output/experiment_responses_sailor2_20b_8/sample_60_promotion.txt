**Explanation:**
- **Ad Attitude:** 
  - Neutral on liking (3): While I acknowledge its existence, my reserved nature makes me indifferent.
  - Slightly Agree on interestingness (4): It's mildly engaging given its promise of energy and looks improvement.
  - Disagree to Neutral for belief in goodness (5): The message is generic; it doesnâ€™t resonate deeply with someone who prioritizes practicality over appearance alone.
  - Strongly Disagree on attractiveness (2): Lacks a personal connection or compelling imagery that would draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Consider purchasing this product (3) because of its claims but not strongly compelled by the ad itself.
  - Might try it if conditions are favorable, such as discounts (4).
  - Will consider buying under certain circumstances, balancing needs with cost and practicality (5). The ad doesn't seal a deal on its own due to my personality traits.
