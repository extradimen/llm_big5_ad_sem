**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (Score: 4):**
   - Neutral-to-mildly-positive since it addresses a common concern about fatigue and appearance, which resonates with my need for self-care.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3):**
   - Slightly agree; while not compelling enough to capture full attention due to its somewhat generic nature, it does tap into basic human needs.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2):**
   - Disagree slightly; lacks strong evidence or creativity that would make me fully trust its claims.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5):**
   - Neutral-to-positive because it uses a fear of tiredness and dull appearance, which can be visually engaging for self-aware individuals.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):**
   - Disagree; my careful nature makes me hesitant without more convincing proof or personal experience.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1):**
   - Strongly disagree; the ad's lack of detailed information and perceived manipulative tone deter me from actively seeking it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3):**
   - Agree slightly; even though I have reservations, acknowledging a potential benefit might prompt some future consideration if more credible reviews or personal recommendations surface.

Overall, the ad has moderate appeal but fails to strongly persuade due to its lack of specific details and my tendency toward thoroughness and skepticism. The cautious approach towards trying new products without solid backing results in lower purchase intention scores.
