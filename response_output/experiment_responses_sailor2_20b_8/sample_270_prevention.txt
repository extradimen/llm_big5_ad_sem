**Evaluation Details:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (4). As someone who is outgoing and sociable but not overly talkative, I find this statement attention-grabbing without being too pushy.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (5). The concept of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance resonates with my daily experiences working in a blue-collar job.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly agree (6). It effectively highlights potential issues I might face, making it relatable and persuasive.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Somewhat Neutral to Agree (3). While visually appealing elements could enhance its attractiveness, my main appeal lies in its content rather than aesthetics.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Considered but not strongly (2). My current budget and monthly income (~30 million VND) make me cautious about immediate purchases.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Moderately likely (3). The benefits seem valuable, so I might give it a trial run if the price aligns with my financial plan.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Likely but not decided yet (4). It falls into consideration for future purchases when budget allows or performance is proven through trials by friends/colleagues.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its message and resonates to some extent, practical considerations like affordability influence my immediate purchase intent. Future experiences with similar products will further guide my decision-making process.
