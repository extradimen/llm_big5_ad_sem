**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its intention to appeal to my daily needs for energy and appearance, it doesn't excite me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 2)**: The concept is straightforward but lacks novelty or compelling detail that would captivate me.
   - **Good (Score: 4)**: It conveys a positive message; however, the generic nature means itâ€™s neither exceptional nor memorable for me.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The visuals and messaging are serviceable but not particularly appealing or distinct from other similar ads.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 5)**: I acknowledge the potential benefits, especially given my demanding lifestyle as a postgraduate student, but direct intent isn't strong.
   - **Try to Buy (Score: 6)**: Curiosity and convenience may lead me to give it a try due to its promise of daily energy support.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 7)**: After trying, if I see noticeable positive effects or fit well into my routine, the probability of continued purchase increases significantly.

In summary, while the ad resonates at an average-to-favorable level and has moderate immediate appeal, it earns higher consideration scores due to practical value. My thorough nature will likely drive me towards evaluating its efficacy before fully committing as a regular consumer.
