**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad*: Strongly Disagree (2): The advertisement's tone doesn't resonate well with me personally.
  - *Interesting*: Neutral (3): It conveys a basic idea but lacks intrigue for someone who values variety and originality in ads.
  - *Believe it’s good*: Agree (4): While I acknowledge the message about fatigue prevention is valid, its execution feels somewhat cliché.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree (1): The presentation appears unappealing given my reserved nature and tendency to find more engaging content.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Disagree (5): Despite the message's relevance, I don't have a strong immediate intent due to reservations about advertising tactics.
  - *Try to buy*: Neutral (6): There is some consideration as addressing fatigue might benefit me; however, brand trust and ad credibility are factors still in question.
  - *Consider buying*: Agree (7): Given my role as an office worker experiencing occasional tiredness, the practical benefits outweigh my critical reservations, making it a product worth considering eventually. 

Overall, while I'm not highly engaged by the advertisement itself, its relevance to fatigue management leads me to consider purchasing under specific circumstances.
