**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad. (*Score: 2*) – While not strongly negative, it doesn't appeal due to its straightforward and potentially manipulative tone.
  - I think the ad is interesting. (*Score: 3*) – Somewhat neutral; lacks creativity that would truly capture my attention.
  - I believe the ad is good. (*Score: 4*) – Neutral leaning toward agreeable, but not compelling enough given its general messaging.
  - I find the ad attractive. (*Score: 2*) – Not particularly appealing visually or conceptually.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I intend to purchase this product. (*Score: 1*) – Strongly disagree; the ad doesn't persuade me as a blue-collar worker with other priorities.
  - I will try to buy this product. (*Score: 2*) – Mild inclination towards trying but not high enough motivation.
  - I will consider buying this product. (*Score: 3*) – Open-mindedness, but without strong intent; external factors might play more significant roles in my purchasing decisions.

Overall, the ad fails to resonate deeply due to its reliance on fear of tiredness and dull appearance rather than genuine benefits or connection with values related to health, productivity, or personal well-being. My cautious nature (Agree: getting nervous easily, Agree: worrying a lot) leads me to be skeptical and prioritize other needs over this product. The lack of imaginative appeal also diminishes its attractiveness for someone who has an active imagination but few artistic interests in advertising content.
