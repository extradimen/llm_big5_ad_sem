### Evaluation Breakdown:
**Ad Attitude:**
1. **I like the ad:** Score = 2 - Given my reserved nature and generally agreeable tendencies towards wellness products but not being strongly sociable, it falls on a lower positive scale.
2. **Interesting:** Score = 3 - The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat engaging for someone who values personal appearance slightly more than I do.
3. **Believe the ad is good:** Score = 4 (Neutral leaning towards Agree) – My tendency to be unselfish makes me consider health benefits, but trust issues reduce full endorsement.
4. **Attractive:** Score = 5 - Attraction comes from the practical aspects of staying energized and looking better daily.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase:** Score = 6 (Agree) – While not strongly motivated by ads alone, I'm open-minded about trying it given my occasional carelessness in making health-conscious choices.
2. **Will try to buy:** Score = 3 - Neutral leaning towards "try," reflecting a mix of curiosity and skepticism; might need further persuasion or personal experience before committing fully.
3. **Consider buying:** Score = 4 (Agree) – The product will stay on my radar, considering its potential benefits alongside my existing concerns about energy levels.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately due to practicality but lacks strong trustworthiness and immediate appeal for a decisive purchase from me personally.
