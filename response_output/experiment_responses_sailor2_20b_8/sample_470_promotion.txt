**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: While not strongly positive, I appreciate an energy drink's promise to help with daily routines.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: It's mildly engaging; however, it doesn’t stand out given my reserved nature and preference for straightforward messages.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: Neutral leaning positive because staying energized and looking good aligns with daily goals but lacks emotional pull due to my Strongly Disagree on being sociable or outgoing.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: Not particularly appealing; I value authenticity over superficial promises, especially since I’m not naturally drawn to high-energy marketing imagery.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly Disagree as my reserved and unselfish nature makes me skeptical of quick-fix solutions.
   
2. **Will try to buy the product (Score: 2)**: Slightly higher than outright intention, but cautious given concerns about overhyped promises.

3. **Consider buying the product (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards consideration; while not dismissive, I'll evaluate further based on practical benefits and reviews due to my generally trusting nature mixed with a bit of worry about effectiveness.

In summary, though open to its message's utility, the ad doesn't resonate strongly enough for me to commit or become an enthusiastic buyer. My reserved personality and preference for reliability over flashy claims influence these scores significantly.
