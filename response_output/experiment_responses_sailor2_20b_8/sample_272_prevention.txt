**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad (score 3):* The ad's messaging resonates somewhat but not strongly.
  - *Interesting (score 2):* It piques my interest as it addresses common fatigue, though I find it somewhat generic.
  - *Good (score 1):* While functional in its message, it lacks depth or creative appeal for me.
  - *Attractive (score 4):* The ad is moderately attractive but doesn't strongly draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product (score 5):* Neutral-to-positive intent; the benefits are compelling, given my lifestyle and stress levels.
  - *Try to buy (score 6):* There's a significant chance I'll test it out based on its preventive claims.
  - *Consider buying (score 7):* Overall, I am inclined to seriously consider purchasing since fatigue is something I experience frequently. 

Combining my talkativeness, occasional nervousness, and need for energy boosters with the ad’s message creates a balanced view—enough skepticism but sufficient interest to explore further.
