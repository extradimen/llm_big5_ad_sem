**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3):** As a talkative and outgoing person, I appreciate visually appealing ads, but this statement feels somewhat generic.
   - **Interesting (2):** The claim of staying energized resonates slightly with my need to keep up daily activities, though it lacks novelty for me.
   - **Good (4):** It conveys positive benefits—energy and appearance improvement—but the messaging could be more compelling or specific.
   - **Attractive (5):** While not particularly eye-catching, its overall presentation is clean and approachable.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (3):** Despite being a thorough job-doer, I am generally cautious about new products without further evidence of effectiveness.
   - **Try to Buy (2):** Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I might give it a try if there's a compelling trial offer or discount. 
   - **Consider Buying (4):** The benefits align with daily needs; hence, I'll keep this product in mind for future consideration but not an immediate priority.

Overall, while the ad presents an appealing message, its impact is moderate due to generic appeal and lack of strong personal connection within my context. A slightly higher score on specific claims or added value could make it more persuasive.
