**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score = 2): Despite not being talkative or outgoing, I acknowledge its existence but find it uninteresting.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score = 3): Neutral leaning towards slightly engaging; promises of energy and appearance appeal minimally to me as a reserved individual.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score = 4): It’s somewhat believable, but not compelling due to my personal values and cautious nature.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score = 3): Slightly attractive since it targets looking and feeling good, though not enough to draw me in strongly.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score = 1): Strongly disagree; my reserved nature coupled with financial constraints makes it unlikely.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score = 1): Similarly, strong disagreement—no immediate desire or need drives me towards trying it out.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score = 2): A neutral-to-light consideration; while not actively dismissive, the benefits aren't compelling enough for a significant investment given my priorities and budget. 

Overall, the advertisement feels somewhat relevant but lacks sufficient resonance with my values, preferences, and current circumstances to motivate a purchase or strong engagement.
