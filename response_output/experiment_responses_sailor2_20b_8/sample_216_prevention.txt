2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score: 4) – It does present an effective scenario where daily vitality can be affected without this drink, making me pay attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral with Tilt Towards Positive (Score: 5) – The message appears credible and addresses a common issue, although it lacks emotional connection or compelling visuals for strong endorsement.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2) – While informational, the aesthetic presentation doesn't strongly appeal to me; it might come across as overly generic.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1) – The current data about its effectiveness is insufficient for a strong buying decision based solely on this ad.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Neutral with Tilt Towards Positive (Score: 2) – Curiosity might lead me to research further, but direct purchase intent isn't high.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score: 3) – The possibility of alleviating tiredness is appealing enough to keep the option open for future consideration if reviews or personal feedback are positive.
