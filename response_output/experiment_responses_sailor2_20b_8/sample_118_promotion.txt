**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 

  1. **I like the ad (score = 4):** It's somewhat appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance, but it doesn't particularly excite me.
  2. **Interesting (score = 3):** Neutral, just enough to capture my attention briefly without being engaging or memorable.
  3. **Good (score = 5):** I believe the claims are reasonable; staying energized and looking good is a general desire.
  4. **Attractive (score = 2):** Not attractive for me due to its potentially over-idealized portrayal, especially since my high sensitivity to marketing tactics diminishes its allure.

- **Purchase Intention:**

  1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 3):** Neutral; I might consider it, but not a strong drive.
  2. **Try to buy the product (score = 2):** Low intent because my budget constraints and existing brands influence my decisions.
  3. **Consider buying the product (score = 1):** Minimal consideration due to skepticism about its long-term value compared to other, more familiar options within my financial limits.

Overall, while there is some merit in what the ad promises, it doesn't sufficiently resonate with me personally or financially drive a purchase decision. My cautious nature and practical priorities keep this product on the lower end of my interest spectrum.
