**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad:** **3 (Neutral)** - The phrase is generic and lacks personal appeal for someone who values helpfulness over appearance.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** **4 (Agree)** - It captures an everyday need, but it doesn't excite or surprise me significantly.
- **I believe the ad is good:** **5 (Slightly Agree)** - The message about energy and looking best seems reasonable for a supplement drink; however, it's not convincing enough to move me strongly.
- **I find the ad attractive:** **2 (Disagree)** - My reserved nature means I’m more drawn towards practicality than flashy promises. Additionally, emotional stability isn't emphasized in my personality.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** **1 (Strongly Disagree)**
  - Given my values and financial constraints ($16M–25M VND/month), I prioritize essential needs over non-essential health beverages.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** **1 (Strongly Disagree)** 
  - The lack of urgency or personal relevance from the ad makes me unlikely to make an effort for a purchase.

- **I will consider buying this product:** **2 (Neutral)**
  - There's mild recognition that it could be beneficial, but my current focus and budget constraints mean I won’t actively seek out this item unless there are compelling reasons or discounts. 

In summary, while the ad is moderately interesting and somewhat effective in conveying its message, it doesn't resonate deeply with my reserved nature, practical outlook, or financial reality. Therefore, my purchase intention remains low despite acknowledging potential benefits for others.
