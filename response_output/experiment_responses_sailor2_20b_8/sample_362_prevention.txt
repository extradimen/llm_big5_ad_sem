**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad**: Moderate (score = 3) — The tone and message resonate slightly but not strongly.
   - **Interesting**: Slightly agree (score = 4) — It piques curiosity, especially for someone who values new ideas.
   - **Good**: Neutral leaning towards Agree (score = 5) — Sees merit in the preventive aspect but doesn't find it groundbreaking.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (score = 2) — Not visually or conceptually engaging enough to strongly attract me.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product**: Moderate (score = 3) — It might be useful, though I'm not compelled to buy immediately.
   - **Will try to buy this product**: Neutral leaning towards Try (score = 3) — Might consider testing it out if convenience factors align.
   - **Consider buying the product**: Lean towards Consider (score = 4) — Worth keeping in mind as an option, especially due to occasional fatigue.

Overall, while I appreciate its preventive message and innovative angle, the ad doesn't strongly resonate or prompt an immediate purchase. There's cautious interest but not enough to drive a firm commitment.
