```

**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad:* My talkativeness and sociability traits are minimal (Strongly Disagree), making personal connection to promotions less likely. Hence, a moderate score of `3`.
   - *Interesting*: The general message seems generic; thus, it doesn't grab my interest strongly (`2`).
   - *Good Advertisement*: While not bad, I find the claims too broad without specific details (Neutral leaning towards lower end, `3`).
   - *Attractive:* The visual and energy appeal might slightly draw attention due to familiarity with wellness concepts, so a moderately higher score of `4`.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Given my strong tendency toward being careless (`Strongly Agree`) and emotional stability neutrality, I am unlikely to make decisive purchases on impulse (`1`).
  - *Try to buy this product:* Even though planning is important for me (Agree), the lack of thoroughness in evaluating products makes it a low likelihood (`1`).
  - *Consider buying*: Despite minimal attraction and moderate engagement, considering buying might occur under special circumstances or further information (`2`).

Overall, while there's some mild positive reception due to personal values like planning, my traits heavily mitigate strong purchase intention.
