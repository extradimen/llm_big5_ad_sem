**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - *Like*: Neutral to slightly positive (3) due to its straightforward nature.
  - *Interesting*: Slightly interesting (4), given it addresses common feelings like fatigue and appearance concerns.
  - *Good*: Moderately disagreeable (2). While informative, it feels somewhat manipulative.
  - *Attractive*: Mildly attractive (3); the visual appeal or brand may have minimal impact.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Strongly disagree (1), since there's no immediate need and my budget constraints are tight.
  - *Try to buy*: Slightly inclined to consider trying it under specific circumstances like high stress days, but not a priority (2).
  - *Consider buying*: Marginally positive consideration level (3); might evaluate the product based on reviews or promotions in future.

This balanced evaluation reflects my reserved nature and cautious approach toward new purchases. While recognizing the ad's message, I'm more inclined to prioritize other needs with my current financial situation.
