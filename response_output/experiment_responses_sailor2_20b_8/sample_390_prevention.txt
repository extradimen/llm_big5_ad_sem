**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad.**: 3 — While not strongly negative, I find it somewhat neutral due to its straightforward appeal.
  - **I think the ad is interesting.**: 4 — It sparks curiosity but doesn't stand out as highly engaging for me.
  - **I believe the ad is good.**: 5 — The message has a logical structure and aims at addressing common feelings, though not exceptionally compelling.
  - **I find the ad attractive.**: 2 — My reserved nature makes it less appealing visually or emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **I intend to purchase this product.**: 1 — Given my financial constraints and cautious approach, I'm unlikely to make an immediate commitment.
  - **I will try to buy this product.**: 2 — There's a slight interest due to its promise of addressing tiredness but not enough to actively seek it out.
  - **I will consider buying this product.**: 3 — It might be worth considering if I face specific fatigue issues, balancing my budget and needs.

In summary, while the ad resonates moderately with me in terms of messaging effectiveness (prevention-focused), its overall attractiveness is low due to personal traits like being reserved and financially cautious. Purchase intent remains minimal but open for consideration under specific conditions.
