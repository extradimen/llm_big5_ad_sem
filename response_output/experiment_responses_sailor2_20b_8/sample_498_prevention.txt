**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score: 6)**: The ad's message resonates with my concern for vitality and appearance, so I find it somewhat appealing.
   - **Interesting (score: 5)**: It captures attention by highlighting negative outcomes without the drink, making it engaging but not spectacularly original.
   - **Good (score: 4)**: While informative, it feels a bit straightforward—good enough to convey urgency but lacks compelling storytelling or creativity for higher marks.
   - **Attractive (score: 3)**: The ad's tone might be slightly aggressive and somewhat manipulative due to the implied consequences. This dampens its overall attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (score: 2)**: Though I see value in maintaining energy levels, a strong intention to buy isn't triggered just by this advertisement.
   - **Try (score: 2)**: It might nudge me into giving it a try if the drink has positive reviews or if offered as part of an office supply order; otherwise, hesitation persists.
   - **Consider (score: 3)**: I’m open to considering the product based on its promise but need more information, user testimonials, and possibly price before making a decision.

Overall, while finding aspects appealing due to personal needs for energy and appearance, critical factors like aggressive language and lack of compelling presentation prevent strong endorsement or immediate purchase intent. The ad is effective enough to spark mild interest but not decisive action.
