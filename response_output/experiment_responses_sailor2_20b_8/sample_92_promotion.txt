**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale)**:
   - **Like**: 3 (Disagree) – As someone who is reserved but generally trusting, I find the ad engaging enough to be pleasant, though not overly compelling.
   - **Interesting**: 4 (Agree) – The idea of staying energized and looking good appeals somewhat, making it interesting in a basic sense.
   - **Good**: 5 (Strongly Agree) – Given my preference for helpful products that serve multiple purposes, the message aligns with positive values, thus seen as a decent ad.
   - **Attractive**: 2 (Disagree) – The promotional nature might not fully capture my reserved and somewhat careless attitude; it feels slightly superficial.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to Purchase**: 4 (Agree) – Though the appeal isn’t overwhelming, I see its utility in maintaining energy levels and appearance, making me inclined towards giving it a try.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: 3 (Neutral) – My tendency toward carelessness means I'm not strongly motivated but could be swayed by convenience or necessity at some point.
   - **Consider Buying**: 4 (Agree) – The ad does prompt consideration, given its alignment with my desire for practical yet beneficial products.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates moderately and reflects positive traits like being helpful and unselfish, it doesn’t fully captivate my reserved nature or counterbalance occasional carelessness. Thus, I'm open to considering but not strongly driven to purchase immediately.
