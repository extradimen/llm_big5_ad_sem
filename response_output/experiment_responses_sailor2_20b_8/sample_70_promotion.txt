**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** While it's not objectionable, my strong talkativeness combined with a slightly critical nature leads me to rate it around neutral-lean towards positive (4 out of 7). The promise of energy is appealing but lacks specific details.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** It raises attention due to its claim about staying energized and looking good, but without context or relatable benefits for someone my age and occupation, interest wanes slightly (3).
3. **I believe the ad is good:** There's a vague sense of credibility in health and appearance claims, though specifics are lacking; I'm moderately convinced (5 out of 7).
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Given its generality and lack of tailored messaging to my situation or values (e.g., balance over raw energy), it feels less compelling (2).

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** The advertisement's broad appeal doesn't align strongly with my current needs as a civil servant, focused on mental stability rather than high-energy drinks; hence, low intention (1).
2. **I will try to buy this product:** There’s slight curiosity but not enough personal relevance or trust in the product specifics to prompt an immediate trial (2 out of 7).
3. **I will consider buying it:** I’m open-minded and thoughtful about trying new things (aligning with Strongly Agree on planning), so there's room for future consideration once more information is available, hence a moderate score (3).

Overall, the ad sparks mild curiosity but falls short in providing enough compelling details or personal relevance to drive strong purchase intention.
