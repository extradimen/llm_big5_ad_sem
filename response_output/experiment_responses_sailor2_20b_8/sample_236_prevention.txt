**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-Point Scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** Agreeable but not overwhelmingly so (`4`). The message resonates at a basic level.
   - **Interesting:** Generally finds it interesting due to its clear benefits, rating as `5`.
   - **Believe is good:** Sees some value in its claim and trustworthiness, scoring `6`.
   - **Attractive:** While not overly attractive, the ad strikes a balance (`3`). The presentation could be improved for stronger appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-Point Scale):**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning toward mild interest (`2`); acknowledges need but isn't immediate.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Moderate willingness to give it a shot, scoring `3`.

In summary:
- The ad is well received at an average level due to the strong emphasis on prevention and benefits.
