**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *Like (2)*: Although talkative and somewhat outgoing, I find it mildly appealing but not strongly likeable.
  - *Interesting (3)*: It presents a clear benefit for feeling more energetic, which has some intrigue but isn't groundbreaking. 
  - *Good (4)*: The messaging is straightforward about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, reasonable enough without being exceptional.
  - *Attractive (5)*: Neutral sociability means it's not overtly attractive or repellant; just neutral to slightly positive.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to purchase (1)*: Despite a strong agreement in planning, the ad isn't compelling enough for me to immediately buy. 
  - *Try to Buy (1)*: The lack of enthusiasm and reservations make trying it less likely.
  - *Consider Buying (3)*: Given my budget and cautious nature, I might consider it if there are no better alternatives or after seeing further evidence.

This evaluation balances the ad's relevance against personal preferences, resulting in moderate interest without high purchase intent.
