**Explanation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral to slightly positive; while it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its focus on tiredness and dull appearanceâ€”perceived as somewhat self-centered for blue-collar workers.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Mildly agreeable, acknowledging the creative appeal in highlighting potential benefits but not exceptionally engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - Disagree; it feels overly manipulative and superficial compared to my values of practicality and hard work.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - Agree, somewhat attracted by its visual presentation and messaging but not enough to be compelling.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; my financial constraints and skepticism about quick fixes outweigh any allure.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly disagreeing; the ad doesn't align with my routine priorities or budget.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Mildly agree, considering it under very specific conditions like extreme fatigue affecting job performance but not a regular purchase intent.

Overall, while I appreciate certain aspects of the presentation and visual appeal, practical concerns about relevance to blue-collar lifestyle and affordability heavily influence my lower score on ad attitudes and minimal purchase intention.
