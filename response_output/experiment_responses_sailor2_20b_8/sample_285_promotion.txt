**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3)
   - While talkative and outgoing is appealing to some extents, the overall messaging feels generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4)
   - The promise of staying energized appeals to daily needs but lacks unique engagement.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (5)
   - Functionally valid claim without standout creativity or emotional connection; decent enough.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree slightly (2) 
   - Lacks personal relevance and fails to excite due to overused promises in similar ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Despite needing energy, current brand awareness or trust issues make actual intent low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Unwillingness due to lack of strong personal connection and skepticism about claims.

3. **I will consider buying the product:** Slightly Consideration (2)
   - If offered as part of a variety pack or during a promotional period, it might get a tentative look but not an immediate purchase decision.

In summary, while acknowledging its functional benefits, my personal traits and emotional stability steer me towards a neutral to slightly negative response without strong intent for purchase.
