  - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: Agree. The messaging seems genuine in promoting both physical energy and self-image improvement.
  - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning toward slight disinterest; it lacks a strong emotional connection for me personally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: Disagree. While I appreciate its claims, my current financial situation and other priorities make an immediate purchase unlikely.
  - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Similar reasoning; cautious about committing resources right now.
  - **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning toward consideration. The benefits align with my values of health and appearance, but it's not an urgent need.
