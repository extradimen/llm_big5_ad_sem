**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: (Score = 6)  
   As a talkative and sociable individual, I find energetic messages appealing; however, the claim to "look your best" feels somewhat superficial.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: (Score = 5)  
   The promise of staying energized resonates with my active lifestyle as a student, but it doesn't ignite strong curiosity.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: (Score = 4)  
   While I appreciate an encouraging message on energy levels, its focus on appearance feels slightly manipulative for younger demographics like mine.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: (Score = 3)  
   The overall presentation isn't compelling enough to capture my attention long-term due to mixed messaging and lack of genuine connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: (Score = 2)  
   Despite finding aspects appealing, I'm not convinced it's a must-have for me right now.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: (Score = 2)  
   If the opportunity arises and the price aligns with my budget (16â€“25 million VND), I might give it a shot out of curiosity, but no strong drive exists.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product**: (Score = 2)  
   While not highly motivated, I remain open to considering future purchases given the right circumstances and endorsements.

In summary, while there are engaging elements in the ad that align with my personality traits, they don't generate a strong enough pull for immediate or intentional purchase. The mixed messaging affects both appeal and trustworthiness from an ideal consumer perspective.
