**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - *I like the ad.* (Score: 2): My reserved and somewhat distrustful nature makes me indifferent to promotional content that feels too generic or superficial.
    - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 3): Neutral interest, not compelling enough given my tendency towards thoroughness but lacking originality in its messaging.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 4): The message about energy and appearance aligns with basic needs, though it lacks strong personal appeal due to my generally cautious approach.
    - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 1): Strongly disagree; doesn't resonate as an individual who values practicality over flashy presentations.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1): Low intent because, despite needing energy boosters, I'm skeptical about the claims and prefer more substantiated options.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1): No inclination to test it; my careful nature means any new product must pass rigorous scrutiny or personal recommendation.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2): Minimal consideration, leaning towards neutral due to the basic appeal but overshadowed by higher priorities and trust issues.

In summary, while acknowledging its functional benefits, I find the ad lacking in depth, credibility, and alignment with my cautious, reserved personality. Consequently, it's unlikely to drive a purchase decision from me.
