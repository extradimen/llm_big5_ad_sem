**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (Score 3):** The ad is mildly appealing but not strongly so due to my slightly skeptical nature and tendency towards emotional stability.
  - **Interesting (Score 4):** It piques some curiosity, particularly around the claimed effects of the drink on energy levels and appearance.
  - **Good (Score 5):** I find it reasonably well-crafted with a clear message but don't fully trust its effectiveness based on my strong skepticism.
  - **Attractive (Score 2):** The visual or emotional appeal is low; I lean more towards practicality than allure.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** A score of 4 indicates moderate intent influenced by the perceived benefits but not enough to drive an immediate purchase.
  - **Try to Buy:** Scoring 3, there's a consideration for giving it a try if convenience and price align with my budget constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND).
  - **Consider Buying:** The final score of 4 reflects that while I might not rush into buying, the idea is kept in mind as an option when needed.

Overall, while thereâ€™s a degree of engagement and interest, my critical nature and cautious attitude mean it's unlikely to lead to an immediate purchase. However, it remains on the radar for future consideration if other factors align favorably.
