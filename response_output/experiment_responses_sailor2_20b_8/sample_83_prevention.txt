**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad**: Agreed somewhat (6) - The strong emphasis on fatigue and dullness appeals to my talkative and sociable nature, making me see it as relevant.
- **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral (5) - It's attention-grabbing but doesn't stand out particularly for its creativity or uniqueness given I have an active imagination.
- **I believe the ad is good**: Somewhat Agree (4) - While persuasive in highlighting a problem, it lacks personal connection and originality to be compelling on a deeper level.
- **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly Disagree (3) - The focus on potential discomfort might appeal but falls short in terms of visual or emotional attraction.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase this product**: 2 (Disagree) – Despite finding it relevant, my current financial constraints and the existence of other alternatives make a firm intention unlikely.
- **Will try to buy this product**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) - Given my budgetary limits (>46,000,000 VND), I'm not inclined toward making an immediate purchase attempt without further consideration or necessity change.
- **Will consider buying the product**: 3 (Somewhat Agree) – Although it’s worth noting for future needs when my financial situation improves or if there are compelling offers.

Overall, while appreciating its message and relevance to health concerns, practicalities weigh heavily in preventing a strong purchase intention at this time.
