**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - *Like (score: 5)*: While the ad's concept appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, its presentation feels generic. I'm not strongly drawn but find it slightly favorable.
  - *Interesting (score: 4)*: The promise is standard in today’s market; thus, while mildly interesting, it doesn't captivate me significantly.
  - *Good (score: 3)*: It conveys a clear benefit and seems professional. However, without specific proof or unique features, my trust isn’t fully solidified.
  - *Attractive (score: 2)*: The visuals may be appealing to some, but as someone who prefers practicality over aesthetics, I find it rather superficial.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend (score: 1)*: Strongly disagree. Despite the claims, my skepticism and cautious nature make me unlikely to commit without concrete proof or personal recommendation.
  - *Try (score: 1)*: Also strongly disagree. Given past experiences with similar products, I'm hesitant to take a chance based solely on this ad.
  - *Consider (score: 2)*: Mildly agree; if the product appears in a familiar store or gets endorsed by someone trustworthy, it might rise slightly above indifference.

In summary, while acknowledging its professional and well-intentioned message, my sociable yet cautious nature leads me to give a somewhat negative overall score for both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention. Practicality, reliability, and personal endorsements would be crucial factors in shifting these scores positively.
