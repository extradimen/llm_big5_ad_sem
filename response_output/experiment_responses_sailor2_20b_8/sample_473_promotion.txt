**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - *I like the ad*: My reserved and sometimes neutral approach make it harder for me to strongly bond with overtly energized or beauty-centric ads (2).
   - *Interesting*: The promise of staying energized is intriguing, but not enough to fully captivate my attention (3).
   - *Good Advertisement*: It hits some relevant aspects such as energy and appearance, so I find it decent in quality (4).
   - *Attractive*: While the message isn't very appealing due to personal priorities elsewhere, it doesnâ€™t turn me off completely; thus, slightly more acceptable attractiveness level (3).

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Given my strong work ethic and need for sustained energy, I see some value in trying such a product occasionally (5).
   - *Try the product*: Curiosity about its effectiveness motivates me to give it a shot if available (6).
   - *Consider buying*: Despite mixed feelings on the ad itself, practical benefits align with my lifestyle, leading me strongly towards considering this purchase (7). 

Overall, I find the advertisement moderately engaging and see potential utility in the product, translating into high consideration for purchasing.
