**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Moderate Agree (3) - While not strongly positive, it resonates somewhat given my talkative nature and interest in wellness.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral to Slightly Agreed (4) - The prevention message keeps it intriguing but doesn't grab me fully due to a preference for less direct appeals.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Moderately Agree (5) - As someone who values thoroughness, I appreciate its straightforward approach and warning against negative effects.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly Disagree (2) - It's functional rather than visually appealing; my reserved nature may not fully respond to this type of presentation.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral leaning toward Disagree (2) - Though I appreciate its effectiveness, current budget constraints and a tendency towards cautious decision-making hold me back.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Slightly Agree (3) - There's interest in trying due to the potential benefits but not an immediate impulse buy.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Disagree (1) - While acknowledging its value, other priorities and financial factors make a purchase less likely at present.

Overall, while I find aspects of the ad compelling, my cautious nature and current situation lead me towards lower intentions for actual purchase consideration.
