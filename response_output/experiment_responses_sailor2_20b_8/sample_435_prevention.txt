**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (3):* The ad is mildly engaging but doesn't excite me strongly.
   - *Interesting (2):* It seems somewhat common and not particularly original in its messaging.
   - *Good (4):* While it conveys a clear message about fatigue and appearance, I find it standard without much depth or creativity.
   - *Attractive (3):* The ad is moderately attractive but lacks the emotional connection needed to be truly compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend (5):* Despite my reservations on how well it's executed, the message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with personal experience.
   - *Try (6):* I'm inclined to give this product a try due to its preventive nature regarding fatigue.
   - *Consider (7):* The compelling need for energy and appearance improvement leads me to seriously consider purchasing.

Overall, while the ad falls short on originality and emotional appeal, it addresses practical concerns about daily life stressors that align with my values. This drives moderate interest in trying or considering buying the product despite some dissatisfaction with its presentation.
