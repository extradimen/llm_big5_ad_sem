**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (3)*: The ad is somewhat pleasant to look at and listen to but does not strongly captivate me.
  - *Interesting (4)*: It seems average in terms of creativity; there's nothing groundbreaking about the message or presentation.
  - *Good (5)*: While I acknowledge it aims to convey benefits effectively, its execution feels generic rather than exceptional.
  - *Attractive (2)*: The overall appeal is low due to my preference for more substance over superficial promises.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend (1)*: Given the lack of strong connection or emotional engagement and feeling that it's overly simplistic, I do not intend to purchase.
  - *Try (3)*: If given a chance through promotion or convenience, I might consider giving it a try but with no immediate urgency or enthusiasm.
  - *Consider (2)*: I will think about buying under specific circumstances (e.g., if offered at discounted rates), but the ad itself does not drive strong consideration.

In summary, while there are minor positive aspects such as clarity in benefits and decent visual appeal, my critical nature finds it lacking depth, originality, and sufficient emotional resonance to significantly influence a purchase decision. Hence, my evaluations reflect moderate to low scores for both attitude towards the ad and subsequent intention to buy.
