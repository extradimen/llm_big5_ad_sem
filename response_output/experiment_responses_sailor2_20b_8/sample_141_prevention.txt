**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like (3)**: The ad is somewhat engaging but doesn't strongly appeal to me due to my reserved and less outgoing nature.
    - **Interesting (4)**: It holds a moderate level of interest; the message about fatigue and appearance hits some truth, but it's generic for Southeast Asian office workers like myself.
    - **Good (5)**: I acknowledge its quality in conveying issues related to productivity, though it falls short on emotional resonance with my personality traits.
    - **Attractive (2)**: The ad lacks enough personal appeal or relatability; the tone seems slightly manipulative.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (1)**: Despite understanding its message, I'm not strongly inclined to buy it as a result of this ad alone.
    - **Try (2)**: There's some mild curiosity but no immediate drive to try it out; my reserved nature and tendency towards planning rather than impulsivity play a role here.
    - **Consider (3)**: It gets me thinking about the product in terms of potential benefits, though ultimately, I need more information or experiences before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's straightforwardness and relevance to office workers' needs, its persuasive power is limited by my reserved personality traits and low emotional engagement. Hence, moderate consideration but no strong intention to buy based on this advertisement alone.
