**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 3* (Neutral)
   - As someone reserved and practical, I don't feel a strong emotional connection to the ad's energetic promise.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 4* (Agree)
   - It piques mild interest with the idea of staying energized; however, it doesnâ€™t excite me intensely.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 5* (Slightly Agree)
   - The claims sound legitimate but not compelling enough to sway my strong trust in proven solutions.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 3* (Neutral)
   - It lacks a personal appeal for me; more focused visuals or testimonials might have been better.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 2* (Disagree) 
   - Given my cautious nature and moderate financial constraints, I'm not driven enough by the ad alone to commit.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2* (Disagree)
   - There's no immediate urgency or compelling reason for a trial purchase based on the advertisement content.

3. **I will consider buying it:** *Score = 3* (Neutral)
   - The ad might spark further research and consideration, especially if additional information highlights cost-effectiveness and trustworthiness.

Overall, while there is some level of engagement with the message, my reserved nature and practical approach mean that I'm inclined towards careful deliberation before making a purchase decision. **The low scores reflect these considerations** but leave room for future influence through more detailed product info or reviews.
