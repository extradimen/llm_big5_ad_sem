**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:** 
   - **Like (4):** Neutral but leaning slightly positive due to my talkative nature and desire for energy.
   - **Interesting (5):** Agreeable; the promise of staying energized resonates with me as an office worker.
   - **Good (6):** Generally agree because it aligns with personal wellness goals, despite not being strongly persuasive.
   - **Attractive (3):** Neutral-leaning negative due to my strong tendency towards carelessness and sometimes worrying about new products.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2):** Low score; while the idea appeals, I'm not highly committed given my cautious nature and occasional nervousness.
   - **Try (3):** Somewhat open-minded but hesitant to commit without further personal experience or recommendations.
   - **Consider (3):** Neutral-to-positive leaningâ€”definitely a product worth considering for its benefits but won't be an immediate purchase decision.

In summary, the ad is moderately appealing with some reservations. Though it aligns well with my lifestyle needs, internal apprehensions and practical considerations influence lower purchase intentions.
