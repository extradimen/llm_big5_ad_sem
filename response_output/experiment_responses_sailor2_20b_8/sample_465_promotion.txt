**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (score of 4) – It feels okay but not particularly exciting.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (score of 5) – The promise to stay energized and look good is engaging enough for me.
  - **Believe it's good:** Strongly Agree (score of 6) – The idea seems credible, especially since energy drinks are popular in my region.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree slightly (score of 3) – While not unattractive, the message feels a bit generic.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards Disagreement (score of 2) – I'm not compelled enough by the ad alone.
  - **Will try to buy it:** Strongly Disagree (score of 1) – There’s no immediate impulse or urgency for me to test it out.
  - **Consider buying it:** Agree (score of 3) – Though not a strong desire, I might think about purchasing if there are discounts or reviews supporting its benefits. 

Overall, the ad is moderately persuasive and resonates somewhat with my needs but falls short in generating a high level of purchase intent given my lifestyle and priorities.
