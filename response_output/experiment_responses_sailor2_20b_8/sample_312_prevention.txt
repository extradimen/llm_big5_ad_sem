**Evaluation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
- **Like (score = 3):** While I appreciate a bit of humor in ads, this statement feels somewhat exaggerated and lacks personal connection.
- **Interesting (score = 4):** The ad does grab attention with its stark warning but doesn't truly captivate me due to its blunt nature.
- **Good (score = 2):** From an objective standpoint, it's straightforward and clear in conveying a potential negative consequence. However, the execution lacks creativity or emotional appeal for me.
- **Attractive (score = 5):** The ad is moderately attractive because of its directness, but I don't find it engaging enough to draw strong admiration.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my preference for thorough work and careful decision-making, the lack of detailed product benefits or evidence doesn’t convince me.
- **Try to buy:** Neutral (2) – I might be open to trying it once if recommended by a trusted source but not because of this ad alone.
- **Consider buying:** Agree (3) – There is room for consideration based on personal experience and feedback from others, though the advertisement itself isn't persuasive enough.

Overall, while acknowledging its directness and warning aspect, I find the ad slightly unappealing due to its overemphasis on negative outcomes without providing compelling reasons or emotional connection. My purchase intention remains low despite some level of openness to considering it later based on further information.
