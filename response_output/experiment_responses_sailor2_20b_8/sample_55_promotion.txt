**Evaluation Notes:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - Like (4): As a talkative and outgoing person, an engaging ad catches my attention but it doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm.
   - Interesting (5): The promise of energy and looking good aligns with daily desires, making it intriguing enough to capture interest briefly.
   - Good (3): While the message is clear, personal experiences suggest that not all such claims are always credible, leading me to be somewhat cautious rather than entirely convinced.
   - Attractive (2): Due to my tendency towards nervousness and worry about potential gimmicks, the overall appeal feels less compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - Intent: Strongly disagree due to a general mistrust of quick-fix promises for energy and appearance without substantial proof or personal endorsement from trusted sources.
   - Try: Disagree because I'm not inclined to invest time in trying an unfamiliar product given my high anxiety around new purchases.
   - Consider: Slightly agree, as practical benefits (if verified) could sway me; external factors such as discounts, reviews, or recommendations might tip the scales towards consideration.

In summary, while appreciating its messaging and finding it interesting, I maintain a cautious stance due to inherent skepticism and personal traits. A more compelling case with supporting evidence would be needed for serious purchase intent.
