**Evaluation Details:**

### **Ad Attitude**
1. **I like the ad:** **Score = 3 (Neutral)** - While I appreciate energy and wellness messages, this slogan is generic; it doesn't resonate with my strong personal values or preferences.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** **Score = 4 (Agree)** - The concept of staying energized appeals to me as a busy civil servant, but it lacks novelty.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** **Score = 5 (Strongly Agree)** - It conveys positive attributes, which are important for maintaining daily well-being and appearance, aligning with common health goals.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** **Score = 2 (Disagree)** - The phrasing seems too clich√©d, lacking a compelling hook that would genuinely attract me or stand out in my busy life.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** **Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)** - Given the lack of specific details about ingredients, benefits, and credentials, I am not inclined towards making an immediate purchase decision.
  
2. **I will try to buy this product:** **Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)** - Without concrete evidence or recommendations from trusted sources, there's no motivation for me to attempt buying it.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** **Score = 2 (Neutral)** - While I may give some thought based on my desire for energy and wellness, the ad alone is insufficient to push me towards a purchase; further information would be required. 

In summary, while acknowledging its positive intentions and recognizing it as generally good advice, my personal traits favoring thoroughness, critical thinking, and skepticism make this advertisement unconvincing without additional substantiation or unique selling points tailored for someone with an extensive background like mine.
