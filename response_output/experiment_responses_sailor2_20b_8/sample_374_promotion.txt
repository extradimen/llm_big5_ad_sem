**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**  
   - **Like (Score: 5):** Neutral to positive; the energy promise appeals but it's not overwhelmingly engaging.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4):** Slightly intriguing as I value staying energized, but could be more compelling for a daily routine focus.
   - **Good (Score: 6):** Generally agreeable since energetic and looking good are important goals. 
   - **Attractive (Score: 5):** Visually appealing enough, though not strongly so.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3):** Neutral; the ad resonates but lacks a strong push for immediate action.
   - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 4):** Mildly inclined to give it a try if offered at an affordable price and available locally.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 2):** Low consideration; while beneficial, not high on my priority list with current financial constraints.

Overall, the ad aligns moderately well with my values but doesn't trigger strong purchasing intent due to budget considerations and lack of personal urgency. It's a positive message without being overpowering.
