**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like (score = 4)** - Although I appreciate the attempt to promote energy and appearance benefits, my reserved nature makes me cautiously positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic.
2. **Interesting (score = 5)** - The concept of staying energized resonates with daily demands as a civil servant, adding some intrigue despite being more focused on practicality than excitement.
3. **Good (score = 3)** - Neutral leaning to slightly agreeable; it conveys value but lacks strong emotional connection or personal relevance due to my reserved and occasionally nervous nature.
4. **Attractive (score = 2)** - While the idea is appealing, I find it less visually compelling and not immediately engaging given my preference for practicality over superficial attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend (score = 1)** - Strongly disagree; despite its benefits, personal budget constraints ($36M-45M VND) make a purchase unlikely.
2. **Try (score = 2)** - Disagree; while curious about the product's effectiveness, my tendency to be thorough and careful means I'd prefer more research or reviews before trying it out.
3. **Consider (score = 3)** - Neutral leaning towards agree; considering potential benefits for energy levels and appearance in a future scenario when financial constraints ease.

In summary, though the advertisement has some merit with its promise of energizing effects and improved looks, my reserved nature and current practical priorities lead me to be generally indifferent but not dismissive. The intention to purchase is low due to budget limitations and cautious decision-making style.
