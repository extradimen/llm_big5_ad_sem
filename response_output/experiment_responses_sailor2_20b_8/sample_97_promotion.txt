**Explanation:**

- **Attitude towards the Ad:**
  - **Like (score=3)**: Disagreeing with being talkative and sociable makes me less inclined to find a flashy or overtly energetic ad appealing.
  - **Interesting (score=2)**: The claim about staying energized is somewhat engaging, but it doesn't resonate strongly given my reserved nature.
  - **Good (score=4)**: Neutral on originality and active imagination means I'm open to the idea in principle; however, no strong emotional connection or trust reduces its perceived value.
  - **Attractive (score=3)**: Neutral stance towards appearance-focused claims due to personal priorities away from vanity products.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (score=1)**: Strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish and sometimes rude suggests skepticism about the product's benefits for my daily life.
  - **Try (score=2)**: Considering a trial, but low trust in advertisements means I wouldn't be quick to buy without additional reassurance or personal experience.
  - **Consider (score=3)**: Given strong agreement on making plans and following through, it indicates that if the price is right within my budget (<15,000,000 VND) and there are reviews from trusted sources, I might consider purchasing eventually. 

Overall, while not dismissive, the ad's messaging feels somewhat disconnected to my values and life priorities. A more grounded approach with practical benefits or endorsements would likely improve its appeal.
