**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score: 3)  
   - While I appreciate energetic advertisements, it feels a bit generic given my active lifestyle in Southeast Asia.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Agree (Score: 4)  
   - The concept of energy and looking good appeals to me somewhat but lacks specific relevance for younger demographics.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Disagree (Score: 2)
   - It seems overly generic, not targeting my personal traits or unique interests effectively.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (Score: 3)  
   - Visuals and messaging are standard; it doesn't capture my attention uniquely.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - Despite being a manager, I'm already cost-conscious with an income of <15,000,000 VND and prioritize budget-friendly solutions over premium energy drinks.

2. **Will try to buy this product:** Slightly Agree (Score: 2)  
   - There's a slight curiosity but not enough compelling reason based on the ad content or price expectations.
   
3. **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral (Score: 3)
   - While I'm open to considering, it wonâ€™t be an immediate purchase; other factors like reviews and personal necessity would sway me further.

Overall, while there's a neutral-to-positive perception of the advertisement, my budget constraints and specific lifestyle preferences steer me away from strong intent or urgency in purchasing this energy drink. A tailored message addressing both efficacy for work-life balance and affordability might resonate more effectively with someone in my demographic.
