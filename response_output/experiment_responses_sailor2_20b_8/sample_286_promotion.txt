**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score=3):** Neutral but leans towards liking due to its clear messaging on energy and appearance benefits.
  - **Interesting (score=2):** Slightly below neutral; it's generic and doesn't grab attention with creativity or novelty.
  - **Good (score=4):** Agrees, as the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to daily needs.
  - **Attractive (score=3):** Neutral because while appealing in concept, it lacks visual appeal or emotional engagement.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly disagree (1). Despite liking the idea, practicality doesn't align with budget and other priorities.
  - **Will try to buy:** Disagree slightly more towards neutral (2), considering a trial if heavily discounted or in need of an energy boost but not a regular habit.
  - **Consider buying:** Slightly leans toward considering (2) as it fits occasional needs, but overall spending is cautious due to other responsibilities and limited artistic appeal.

Overall, the ad meets basic expectations but doesn't strongly compel given my reserved, practical nature and current financial constraints. Thus, while favorable, purchase intent remains low.
