**Evaluation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**  
    It's not particularly engaging; it plays on common concerns but doesn't feel unique or compelling.
   
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**  
    Slightly intriguing as it addresses fatigue and appearance, which resonate with my lifestyle.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**  
    It effectively conveys its message but feels somewhat generic, lacking strong emotional appeal or innovation.
   
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**  
    The visual presentation might be average and doesn't catch my eye enough.

**Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**  
   Low intention; though I understand its benefits, current budget constraints and lack of strong engagement deter me.
   
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**  
    Somewhat inclined but not motivated enough due to competing priorities.

- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3)**  
   While I acknowledge its potential value, the overall ad impact isn't strong enough for an immediate purchase decision; it's on my radar for future consideration under better circumstances.
