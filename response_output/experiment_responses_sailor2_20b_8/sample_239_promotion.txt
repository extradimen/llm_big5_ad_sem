**Explanation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its goal of promoting energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't particularly excite me.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The ad's message is somewhat engaging but falls short due to a lack of innovative or unique presentation.

- **Good (Score: 5)**: It meets basic expectations for being informative about the product’s perks; however, there isn’t much that stands out as exceptional.
  
- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The appeal is minimal. Given my reserved nature and tendency to worry about over-promised results, I find it less visually or emotionally attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase**: My strong agreement with thoroughness in work doesn't translate into a spontaneous purchasing decision; hence, it's a 2 (Neutral-leaning towards Disagree).
  
- **Try the product**: Considering my practical and methodical nature combined with some skepticism about its efficacy, I'm cautiously neutral but leaning toward not trying (`Score: 2`).

- **Consider buying**: Given my strong preference for original ideas in personal endeavors rather than blindly following such ads and my cautious approach due to emotional instability and trust issues, the intention is very low (`Score: 1`). 

Overall, while understanding its purpose, I don’t find this ad compelling enough or personally relevant to drive a high purchase intent. The message needs more substance to align with someone like me who values thoroughness but remains wary of superficial promises.
