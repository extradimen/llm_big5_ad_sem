**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** 4 – While I appreciate its intention to energize and improve appearance, it doesn't fully resonate with my personality.
  - **Interesting:** 5 – The concept is engaging but not groundbreaking for someone who values practicality over flashy claims.
  - **Good:** 3 – It's decent in message delivery but lacks emotional or personal connection given my concerns about trust and nervousness.
  - **Attractive:** 2 – My strong agree with being talkative and outgoing doesn't align well enough to find the ad visually appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) – The combination of my financial situation, emotional stressors, and cautious nature makes an immediate buy unlikely.
  - **Try to buy this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) – My tendency towards careful decision-making overrules the ad's appeal.
  - **Consider buying this product:** 2 (Disagree slightly) – It falls into consideration but only due to its stated benefits; I need more persuasive factors or trust in the brand.

Overall, while acknowledging the drink’s potential positive effects, my personality traits and current life circumstances don't drive a strong intent or immediate action towards purchasing.
