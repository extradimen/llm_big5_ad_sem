**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4/7):** The ad is engaging and resonates with my need to avoid fatigue and maintain an appealing appearance.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** While it grabs attention, its messaging feels somewhat overplayed in a saturated market of similar products.
   - **Good (2/7):** Credibility could be enhanced; the claim about feeling tired seems generic rather than specific to this drink. Needs more evidence or unique benefits.
   - **Attractive (5/7):** The concept is visually and emotionally appealing, highlighting a common daily struggle.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3/7):** I am not strongly committed due to lack of personal connection but the message does pique mild interest.
   - **Try (2/7):** Given my budget constraints ($36-45 million VND) and desire for variety, trying it once is a possibility if available at an acceptable price point.
   - **Consider (3/7):** I will keep this product in mind during future shopping trips but won't prioritize over other current needs or alternatives.

Overall, the ad succeeds moderately by addressing my concerns about energy levels and appearance. However, stronger claims backed by unique features would boost credibility and purchase intent significantly.
