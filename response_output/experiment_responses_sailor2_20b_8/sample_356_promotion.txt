**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **I like the ad (score = 2):** Given my reserved nature and tendency towards cautious trust, I don't find it particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting (score = 3):** The promise of energy boosts is somewhat appealing but not compelling enough for a strong interest. 
  - **Good (score = 4):** Neutral; while the benefits sound positive, there's nothing outstanding to convince me it’s superior in my market saturated with similar products.
  - **Attractive (score = 5):** Slightly above neutral since an energetic and fresh appearance is desirable for daily activities.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1):** Strongly disagree; due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), I prioritize basic necessities over discretionary health drinks.
  - **Try to buy this product (score = 2):** Slightly agree; open-minded but not driven enough given other financial priorities and less confidence in quick results.
  - **Consider buying the product (score = 3):** Neutral-agree; might consider it if there's a compelling discount or significant evidence of effectiveness, balancing my cautious nature with potential benefits. 

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s messaging aimed at health and appearance improvements, practical considerations like cost and real-world impact heavily influence my lower purchase intent scores despite mild interest in its claims.
