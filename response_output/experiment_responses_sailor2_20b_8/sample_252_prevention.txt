**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (neutral/agree/somewhat agree/disagree):**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — The ad appeals modestly, but it’s not particularly engaging or resonant with my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The concept of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance has moderate appeal; however, given I'm practical and slightly skeptical about promises from ads, it doesn't captivate me fully.
  - **Good:** Somewhat agree (5) — It presents a clear message but lacks the emotional depth that would strongly convince someone like me. The language is direct yet not overly compelling.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — As a reserved person who values subtlety, this ad feels more attention-grabbing than attractive; it leans towards manipulative persuasion.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral-to-mildly agree (3) — While the message is clear and somewhat persuasive, my cautious nature requires further consideration beyond just an interesting advertisement.
  - **Try to Buy:** Agree (4) — Given I'm generally trusting and practical, if it's available at a reasonable price point and from a reputable source, I might give it a try. 
  - **Consider Buying:** Somewhat agree (5) — The concerns about fatigue align with my health-conscious habits; thus, I’m open to considering this product but will weigh its effectiveness against alternatives.

Overall, while the ad captures my attention on an informational level and aligns somewhat with practical needs, it doesn’t deeply connect emotionally or inspire a strong buying decision. **My balanced approach emphasizes thoughtful consideration rather than immediate purchase intent**.
