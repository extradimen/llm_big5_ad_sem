**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
    - *Like (5)*: The ad's message is somewhat engaging due to its straightforward focus on fatigue and appearance.
    - *Interesting (4)*: It captures attention with a clear problem statement but lacks creativity for full engagement.
    - *Good (3)*: Functionally informative, though it could benefit from more compelling visuals or emotional connection.
    - *Attractive (2)*: The appeal is modest; the visual and narrative style need improvement to stand out.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - *Intend (2)*: While I understand its utility, my limited budget may prioritize necessities over a pricey drink for energy maintenance.
    - *Try (1)*: Unlikely to invest without significant trust or immediate need; the ad doesn't build strong enough conviction.
    - *Consider (2)*: Might factor it in during times of high stress but not as an automatic choice, given my moderate skepticism and limited funds.

This response reflects a balanced assessment with some appreciation for practicality yet cautious about making impulsive purchases based on this particular advertisement.
