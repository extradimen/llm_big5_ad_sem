**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 6)**: I find the concept of an energizing and beauty-enhancing drink appealing to my talkative and outgoing nature. It aligns with wanting a boost for daily activities.
- **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The idea resonates, especially since it promises dual benefits which can make conversations engaging in social settings.
- **Good (Score: 4)**: While I appreciate the proposition, neutral feelings about helpfulness and being original might moderate my belief. It needs more compelling evidence for full trust.
- **Attractive (Score: 3)**: Despite liking its premise, a mix of agreeable traits and sometimes rudeness means it doesn't instantly captivate me. The overall attractiveness is subdued.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase**: I'm not strongly inclined due to neutral feelings towards being unselfish; the promise seems generic rather than essential.
- **Will try (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree here, as trying a new product feels unnecessary given current habits and budget concerns.
- **Consider buying**: Neutral-to-mild interest means I might consider it if offered during sales or with reliable user reviews.

Overall, while the ad conceptually aligns well with some aspects of my personality (talkative, outgoing), it doesn't sufficiently persuade me to take immediate action. The balance between appeal and practicality keeps my purchase intentions low but open for future consideration under favorable conditions.
