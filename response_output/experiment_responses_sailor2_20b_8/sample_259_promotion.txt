**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **Like (Score 4):** The ad is somewhat appealing to me but doesn't create a strong emotional connection.
- **Interesting (Score 5):** I find it moderately interesting due to the promise of staying energized, which aligns with my busy lifestyle and need for daily vitality.
- **Good (Score 6):** While not perfect, the ad effectively communicates its benefits—staying energetic and looking good—which resonates positively as a Southeast Asian woman in her early twenties. 
- **Attractive (Score 3):** The visual appeal is average; it could be more engaging to fully attract my attention.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend (Score 2):** I don't have an immediate plan to buy the product, mainly because there are many alternatives available in the market.
- **Try (Score 1):** Low intention here as I prefer direct experience with a brand or product before committing. The ad is not compelling enough for me to take that step without further research.
- **Consider (Score 4):** There's some consideration; given my strong agreement on following through with plans and being open-minded, I will keep the option in mind if reviews are favorable.

Overall, while the ad presents an enticing proposition, it lacks a strong emotional pull or unique selling point to drive immediate action. Thus, although I see its value, purchase intention remains moderate due to existing preferences and cautious consumer behavior.
