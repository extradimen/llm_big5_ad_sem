**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *Like:* Neutral, as the ad's promise of energy and appearance improvement resonates with my daily needs but doesn't excite me passionately (score = 4).
  - *Interesting:* Slightly agree; it presents a clear benefit that appeals to modern lifestyles (score = 5).
  - *Good:* I find it effective in highlighting key benefits, making the ad well-crafted (score = 6).
  - *Attractive:* Generally neutral; while visually and verbally engaging, thereâ€™s room for improvement to make it more compelling (score = 3).

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend:* Moderate intention due to practical appeal but not a strong impulse buy (score = 2).
  - *Try:* Slightly agreeable to giving it a try if the product aligns with my budget and routine adjustments (score = 3).
  - *Consider:* Overall, I'm open to considering purchase as part of maintaining an active lifestyle; some hesitation remains due to other priorities (score = 4).

This evaluation reflects a balanced yet cautious approach influenced by practical benefits rather than immediate excitement. The ad effectively communicates its value but needs additional reinforcement for stronger consideration or impulse buy.
