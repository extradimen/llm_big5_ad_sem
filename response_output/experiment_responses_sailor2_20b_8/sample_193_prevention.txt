**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad. (score = 3)**: While not strongly negative or positive, I find it decently pleasant but unexciting.
  - **Interesting (5)**: The message about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance intrigues me enough to keep my attention.
  - **Good (4)**: It’s effective in conveying a clear benefit without being overly dramatic. 
  - **Attractive (2)**: Despite its functional appeal, the advertisement lacks visual or emotional flair that would truly attract me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase (score = 2)**: The ad's promise is appealing but not strong enough for a firm commitment.
  - **Will try to buy (3)**: I might give it a shot if the product aligns with my lifestyle and budget.
  - **Consider buying (4)**: It’s on my radar, and I’m open to reviewing more information before making a decision.

Overall, while the ad is engaging enough to register interest, its lack of strong emotional connection or compelling visuals limits higher scores for both attitude and purchase intention. However, it does spark consideration due to its practical relevance as someone who prioritizes staying active and appearing energetic.
