**Evaluation Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (2): The "Strongly Agree" to being sometimes rude and neutral stance on thoroughness suggest a balanced but not overly positive attitude towards persuasive tactics.
   - *Interesting:* (3): Neutral interest; may perceive it as standard rather than exciting or fresh.
   - *Good:* (4): Moderately believes in the ad's message due to work-related stress concerns, yet doesn't strongly trust or connect emotionally.
   - *Attractive:* (3): Slightly below neutral—finds the ad okay but not compelling enough given my reserved and untrusting tendencies.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase.* (2): Low intention; while the message resonates in principle, personal habits or other factors might prevent a strong commitment.
   - *Will try:* (3): Mildly open to trying due to potential benefits for energy and appearance but not rushed into action.
   - *Consider buying.* (4): Neutral-to-positive consideration—will weigh pros and cons, influenced by the product's relevance in managing fatigue during work.

Overall, though the ad is moderately appealing and believable, my critical nature and preference for thoroughness make a strong purchase decision less likely. The scores reflect this nuanced consumer reaction based on personality traits and lifestyle factors.
