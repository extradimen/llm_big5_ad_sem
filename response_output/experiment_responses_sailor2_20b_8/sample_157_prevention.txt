**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**  
   - *Like (Score: 5)*: The ad resonates somewhat due to its clear message about fatigue and dull appearance but it's not highly engaging.
   - *Interesting (Score: 6)*: It piques curiosity as addressing common issues like feeling tired, making it relevant for those looking for a quick fix.
   - *Good (Score: 4)*: While the messaging is effective in highlighting problems, there’s room for improvement in creativity and emotional appeal.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: Not very attractive; lacks compelling visuals or persuasive storytelling to truly draw me in.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - *Intend (Score: 2)*: The ad might not drive a strong purchase intent since it doesn't connect with my deep values and lifestyle.
   - *Try (Score: 3)*: I would be open to trying if the product seems credible, but hesitation remains due to skepticism about quick fixes.
   - *Consider (Score: 3)*: It’s on my radar for consideration, especially given work stress, but other factors like personal preference and reviews will heavily influence the decision.

Overall, while understanding its appeal in addressing common concerns, I require more compelling evidence of effectiveness before making a purchase. The ad is informative yet not entirely persuasive within this demographic profile.
