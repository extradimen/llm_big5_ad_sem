**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (3)** - While I recognize it attempts to be appealing, my general tendency towards being reserved and not overly talkative means I don't find myself drawn to its promotional tone.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4)** - The idea of staying energized appeals slightly but isn’t particularly engaging given other priorities.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2)** - While it presents a useful benefit, my strong agreement with feeling nervous and worrying leads me to question exaggerated claims without clear evidence.

4. **I find the ad attractive (3)** - The design may be visually decent but doesn't align strongly with personal preferences or emotional stability concerns.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1)** - Given my low income and cautious approach, immediate intent isn’t strong; I'm more concerned about practical needs.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (2)** - Neutral inclination but leaning towards not trying due to budget constraints and the perceived need for a better understanding of its efficacy.

3. **I will consider buying this product (2)** - There is some consideration value, mostly out of curiosity about how it might help daily energy levels; however, this remains low given broader priorities and financial limitations.

Overall, while there are mild positive aspects, my critical nature, nervous disposition, and budget constraints lead to a cautious evaluation with lower scores across both attitude and purchase intention.
