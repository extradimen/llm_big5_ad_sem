**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (3) Neutral
   - While not strongly negative or positive, it doesn't particularly resonate with my preferences for being more reserved and emotionally stable.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (4) Agree
   - The promise of energy and appearance benefits mildly piques interest but isnâ€™t compelling enough given my generally practical outlook.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (5) Agree
   - It conveys a clear message, though it feels somewhat generic for everyday products I encounter regularly.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (2) Disagree 
   - The visual and emotional appeal doesn't align with my reserved nature or high standards of credibility.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (1) Strongly Disagree
   - Given my practical, cautious approach, I need more convincing benefits tied directly to work efficiency rather than appearance alone.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (2) Disagree 
   - There's minimal motivation to explore the product without compelling personal relevance or necessity.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (3) Neutral
   - I'm open but not actively leaning towards purchase; it might be considered in context of needing a reliable energy booster, yet other options may appear more suitable given my preferences and budget constraints.

In summary, the advertisement does have some engaging aspects, but overall falls short for me due to lack of personal relevance and alignment with my reserved, practical personality. While not outright dismissed, it doesn't drive strong purchase intent or emotional connection.
