**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
    - I like the ad (Score: 4): While talkative and generally trusting, I find it somewhat engaging but not overly appealing.
    - It's interesting (Score: 5): The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with practical concerns of maintaining energy levels.
    - Good advertising (Score: 6): Structured clearly to highlight potential drawbacks without the product; effective in presenting a problem-solution scenario.
    - Attractive appeal (Score: 3): Despite my active imagination, I find it more informational than visually or emotionally captivating.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    - Intent to purchase (Score: 2): Although acknowledging its relevance, personal financial constraints and cautious nature keep me from strong commitment.
    - Will try to buy (Score: 3): Itâ€™s a possible consideration given the stress on benefits but not an immediate decision.
    - Consider buying (Score: 3): I will evaluate based on further information or reviews due to high self-care concern despite moderate skepticism of promotional claims.

This balanced evaluation reflects my demographic, personality traits, and practical considerations. While appreciating its effectiveness in highlighting needs, the price point relative to income remains a critical factor influencing purchase intention.
