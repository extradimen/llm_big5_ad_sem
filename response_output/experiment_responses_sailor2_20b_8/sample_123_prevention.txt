**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
  - *Like*: Neutral (scored a 3) because the message is straightforward but not particularly appealing given my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality over excitement.
  - *Interesting*: Slightly Agree (4) due to its claim about preventing tiredness, which is relevant for daily life, though it doesn't captivate me deeply.
  - *Good*: Moderate Agreement (5), as the ad effectively communicates a potential benefit but lacks emotional resonance or compelling imagery for someone like myself who prefers factual information over grandiose promises.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree (2) since my reserved and sometimes cautious nature makes it less likely I'll find this visually attractive without additional persuasive elements.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**: 
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Consideration level (3). The message of fatigue prevention is valid, but personal habits, budget constraints (<15 million VND/month), and my generally critical approach mean it's not a sure buy.
  - *Try to Buy*: Similar consideration (3) as I might try the product if there are no immediate alternatives that meet similar needs at a comparable price.
  - *Consider Buying*: Moderate Consideration (4). Given its relevance, potential utility, and my tendency towards planning, it remains on the list of options for future evaluation or necessity-based purchase.

In summary, while not overly impressed by the advertisement's presentation style, I recognize the product could address real needs related to energy levels. However, a more compelling offer or personal urgency would be necessary to prompt an immediate purchase decision given my cautious and reserved nature.
