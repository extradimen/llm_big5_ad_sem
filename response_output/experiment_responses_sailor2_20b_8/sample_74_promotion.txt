}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Score = 5)**: I find some aspects of the ad appealing due to its straightforward message on staying energized and looking good.
   - **Interesting (Score = 4)**: The concept is intriguing but could be more engaging with additional details or emotional connection.
   - **Good (Score = 6)**: It communicates a positive benefit effectively, which aligns well with my desire for better daily performance.
   - **Attractive (Score = 3)**: While not unattractive, the overall presentation lacks personal resonance and may appear too generic.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score = 2)**: I am not strongly compelled based on this ad alone; it's an okay product idea but needs more convincing.
   - **Try to Buy (Score = 3)**: There is mild interest, especially if there are good reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
   - **Consider Buying (Score = 4)**: The advertisement raises awareness and prompts me to think about the potential benefits, putting it on my radar for future consideration.

This evaluation reflects a balanced approach influenced by both skepticism of generic marketing messages and openness to products that align with staying active and presentable. While not highly persuasive, it leaves room for further exploration based on external validation or direct experience.
