**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards a moderate positive response due to its straightforward appeal but not overly engaging for me.
     *Score: 4*
   - **Interesting:** The message is clear, though it doesn't captivate or surprise me enough.
     *Score: 3*
   - **Good:** It effectively communicates the problem (feeling tired and looking dull), which resonates on a practical level. 
     *Score: 5*
   - **Attractive:** While visually appealing ads might draw more interest, this one seems standard without standing out significantly.
     *Score: 2*

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** The ad's message is credible but I don't feel a strong urge to buy right now.
     *Score: 2*
   - **Will Try to Buy:** It does pique my interest enough for me to give it a chance, especially considering the productâ€™s promise of energy and appearance improvement.
     *Score: 3*
   - **Consider Buying:** Given its relevance (I value staying alert) combined with moderate persuasion from the ad, I'm open to adding it after further research or trying samples.
     *Score: 4*

Overall, while the advertisement effectively highlights a relatable concern and presents an actionable solution, my cautious nature and need for more personal connection mean it falls short of strong appeal. However, it does make me consider giving the product a try.
