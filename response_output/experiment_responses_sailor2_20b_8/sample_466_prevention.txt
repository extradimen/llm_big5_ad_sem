**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3)**: While I appreciate its intention to highlight potential negative outcomes without the product, it doesn't deeply resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (2)**: The concept is somewhat clich√© and lacks novelty for someone who values originality.
   - **Good (4)**: It does convey a clear message effectively, albeit predictably; hence, I find it okay but not exceptional.
   - **Attractive (3)**: The appeal isn't strong due to its reliance on fear of looking tired or dull, which feels somewhat manipulative.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (5)**: Despite a moderate dislike for the ad style, I acknowledge the product's potential benefits in preventing fatigue and enhancing appearance.
   - **Try (5)**: Curiosity is piqued enough to give it a try since my thorough nature might value its efficacy once verified.
   - **Consider (6)**: Given my generally unselfish tendency towards helping others feel better, along with an active imagination for considering new solutions, I am more likely to seriously consider the product.

Overall, while not impressed by the ad itself, the practical benefits align well with personal values and habits, leading to a relatively high consideration score.
