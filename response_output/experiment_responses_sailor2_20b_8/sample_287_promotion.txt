**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (4/7):** While I find it somewhat enjoyable due to its energetic and positive messaging, there's no strong connection.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The claims about staying energized and looking good are engaging but not groundbreaking.
   - **Good (6/7):** It effectively communicates the benefits which can appeal to a health-conscious audience; I appreciate clear value propositions.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Personally, being more reserved means that flashy or overly energetic ads don’t strongly pull me in.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Although the message is compelling, my practical side and caution regarding product effectiveness weaken my immediate intent.
   - **Try (4/7):** I'm open to giving it a try if others share positive experiences or there are solid reviews backing its efficacy.
   - **Consider (4/7):** It's definitely on my radar for future purchases, especially since maintaining energy and appearance is important; however, other factors will influence the final decision. 

This evaluation balances my critical nature with an acknowledgment of the ad’s persuasive elements but maintains a level-headed approach to purchasing decisions.
