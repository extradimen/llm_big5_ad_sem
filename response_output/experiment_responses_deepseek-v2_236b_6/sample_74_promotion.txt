Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree in his late 50s from China, I approach advertisements with a critical eye. The claim that the drink helps stay energized and look one's best every day is not entirely convincing without substantiating evidence or testimonials. However, it does pique my interest to some extent (score of 4 for "interesting"), as looking one's best can be appealing in social and professional contexts.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding the ad moderately attractive, there isn't enough information provided to make a strong commitment to purchase the product immediately (1 on intend). I might consider it more if I encounter further endorsements or reviews (3 on consider), but for now, my intent is low.
