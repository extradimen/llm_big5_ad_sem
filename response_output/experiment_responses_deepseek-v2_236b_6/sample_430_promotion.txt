Explanation:
- The ad is not strongly liked (score of 3) but it's found to be somewhat interesting and attractive (scores of 4 and 6). It's considered good but not exceptionally so (score of 5).
- Purchase intention is low with no strong intent to purchase (score of 2), a mild willingness to try (score of 1), and moderate consideration for buying the product (score of 4). This reflects that while the ad has some appeal, it doesn't strongly motivate immediate action or high interest in purchasing.
