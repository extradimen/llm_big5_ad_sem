Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad moderately likable (4), somewhat interesting (5), it's neither particularly good nor bad in my view (3), and slightly attractive as it promises benefits that could be appealing to many people (4).
- **Purchase intention:** While I might not actively seek out this product, if it were convenient or presented at the right time, I would give it a try (2). However, my primary intent is to consider buying the product rather than making an immediate purchase decision (3).
