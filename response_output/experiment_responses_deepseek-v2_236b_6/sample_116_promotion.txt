  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Neutral to slightly negative about considering it as a good ad. It doesn't stand out as particularly well-crafted or persuasive.
  4. I find the ad attractive (6): Slightly more inclined towards finding it attractive, likely because of the promise of personal benefits that align with self-improvement aspirations.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (2): There is a low level of intent to actually buy the product right away, possibly due to skepticism or other priorities in spending.
  2. I will try to buy this product (1): Lowest score indicating that there's no immediate plan to seek out and acquire the product, but it doesn't rule out a future possibility if circumstances change or more information becomes available.
