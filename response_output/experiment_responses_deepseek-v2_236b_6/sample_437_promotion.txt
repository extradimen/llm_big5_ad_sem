Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) as it aligns with my energetic and sociable personality. It is moderately interesting to me (score 5), but not necessarily "good" in terms of quality or presentation (score 3). My like for the ad is moderate (score 4) due to its appeal but also skepticism regarding claims.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: I am open to trying the product (score 1) as a student who values energy, but my intention to purchase it right away is low (score 2), indicating consideration rather than immediate action. My overall consideration for buying the product is moderate (score 3), reflecting that while interested, there are other factors to consider before making a decision.
