Explanation:
- The advertisement is about a drink that claims to help stay energized and look one's best. This aligns with the demographic profile of being under 20 years old and having an outgoing personality (Agree), which might be interested in looking their best for social activities. However, the individual also has some concerns such as not making plans and following through with them (Disagree) and tending to be careless (Agree), which may affect how seriously they take the product claims.
- The attitude towards the advertisement is somewhat positive but not strongly so: 
  - "I like the ad." (Score: 3): There's some appeal due to its promise of energy and looking good, but it doesn't resonate deeply with personal values or preferences.
  - "I think the ad is interesting." (Score: 4): The claim about staying energized could be appealing for an active lifestyle, making it moderately interesting.
  - "I believe the ad is good." (Score: 2): While there is some interest, skepticism about thoroughness in doing a job (Disagree) might lead to doubts over how reliable or beneficial the advertised product truly is.
  - "I find the ad attractive." (Score: 5): The idea of looking one's best could be attractive for someone who enjoys being sociable and outgoing.
- Regarding purchase intention, there is a low likelihood of immediate action due to several factors such as not making plans or following through with them (Disagree) and generally trusting the ad (Disagree). However, it doesn't rule out considering the product in the future:
  - "I intend to purchase this product." (Score: 1): Given other priorities like being careless about details, an immediate intention to buy is low.
  - "I will try to buy this product." (Score: 2): There might be a slight inclination to give it a try but without strong commitment or planning.
  - "I will consider buying this product." (Score: 3): The ad has made an impression, and depending on future circumstances or needs, the individual may potentially revisit their decision to purchase.
