Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (score 4): The advertisement's claim to provide energy and enhance appearance is appealing, but there is a level of skepticism.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score 5): It catches attention with its promise of daily benefits.
  - I believe the ad is good (score 3): While it has an attractive message, there's a need for more evidence to fully endorse its goodness.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 4): The idea of looking and feeling one's best every day is compelling but requires further substantiation.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There's an inclination towards trying the product, driven by curiosity rather than a strong intention.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 3): The ad has created enough interest to consider purchasing but not with a high level of commitment.
  - I will consider buying this product (score 4): Given the promise made by the advertisement, there is an open-mindedness towards considering its purchase after assessing other factors such as reviews and price.
