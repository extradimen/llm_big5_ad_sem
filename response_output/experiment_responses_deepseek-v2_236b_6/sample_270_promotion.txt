Explanation:
- Attitude towards the advertisement: I find it moderately attractive (score 5) and somewhat interesting (score 4), but my overall liking for the ad is only average (score 3). The claim that the drink helps stay energized and look best every day seems appealing, but as a reserved individual who doesn't worry much or get nervous easily, I am not entirely convinced of its necessity.
- Purchase intention: While the advertisement does catch my attention with its promise of energy and appearance benefits, my purchase intent is only moderate (scores 2 to 4). As an educated managerial employee with a high income, I tend to be more careful in making purchasing decisions and would likely consider other options before deciding on this product. Additionally, as someone who leans towards original ideas rather than artistic interests, the ad's focus on looking one's best might not resonate strongly enough for me to prioritize its purchase.
