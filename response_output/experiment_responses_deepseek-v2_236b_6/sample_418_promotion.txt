Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a reserved individual with an active imagination but few artistic interests, I find some aspects of the ad appealing (e.g., it's interesting and potentially good for its purpose), but I am not strongly attracted to it or convinced that it is particularly likable. The score reflects my neutral to slightly positive view on the ad's quality without being overly enthusiastic.
- **Purchase intention:** Although the ad does not resonate deeply with me, as a civil servant who values thoroughness and plans, I might consider purchasing the product if there is compelling evidence of its effectiveness. However, my general distrusting nature means that I would likely approach this purchase with caution, hence the low scores for immediate intent to buy or trying it out without further research.
