Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to promise energy and appearance benefits, which are attractive features for many consumers. However, as an individual who is reserved, emotionally stable, and not easily swayed by emotional appeals (as indicated by my personality traits), I find parts of the ad appealing but also maintain a level of skepticism.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad may have some appeal, my purchase intentions are low due to being generally cautious with advertising claims and needing more information or evidence to support the product's effectiveness before making a decision.
