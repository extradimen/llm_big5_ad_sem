Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a postgraduate educated civil servant with an outgoing personality and a strong sense of helpfulness, I find the advertisement somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking), moderately interesting (score 4), fairly good in terms of its message (score 5), and quite attractive due to its promise of energy and looking one's best (score 6). However, my reserved nature and tendency to worry a lot make me more critical and less likely to strongly agree with the attractiveness of the ad.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding elements of the advertisement appealing, my personality traits that lean towards being thorough and careful lead me to have low purchase intentions. I am not inclined to immediately intend to buy the product (score 1), but if it comes highly recommended or has strong reviews, I might try to buy it (score 2). It is within the realm of possibility that I would consider buying the product after further investigation and deliberation (score 3), reflecting my cautious approach to decision-making.
