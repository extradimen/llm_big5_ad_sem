Explanation:
- I moderately like the ad (score 3) as it speaks to energy and appearance, which can be appealing.
- I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4), but not overly so due to its common message about energy drinks.
- I think the ad is just okay; it's a standard claim for this type of product, hence the neutral score of 2.
- The ad is moderately attractive to me (score 5) as it targets general benefits that many people might seek in a drink.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I don't intend to purchase the product right away (score 1), possibly due to skepticism about such broad claims without more specific information.
- If there is further promotion or positive reviews, I might try to buy this product (score 2).
- However, at present, I would only consider buying it (score 3) as my interest level is not high enough to make an immediate decision, and the ad doesn't provide enough convincing details for me to be immediately persuaded.
