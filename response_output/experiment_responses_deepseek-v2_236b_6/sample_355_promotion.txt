Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (4), interesting enough to hold my attention (5), but not necessarily outstanding in quality (3). It's visually attractive and relevant to my needs as an office worker who could use a boost of energy during the workday (4).
  
- **Purchase intention**: While the advertisement does catch my interest, I am somewhat skeptical about its claims. Therefore, while I don't have immediate plans to purchase it (2), I might consider buying this product if there is further evidence or positive reviews supporting its effectiveness (4). It's not a strong intent due to my general distrust and cautiousness in making purchases based on advertisements alone.
