Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (3), it's interesting enough to hold my attention (5), and I believe it is a good advertisement in terms of its message (6). However, while it doesn't strongly appeal to me personally, I can see how others might like it (4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: The ad does not persuade me strongly to intend to purchase the product immediately (1), but it could be something I would try to buy if I were in need of an energy boost and came across it at a store (2). It's more likely that I will consider buying the product when evaluating my options, rather than being driven by this ad alone to make a purchase (3).
