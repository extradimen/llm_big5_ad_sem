Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I am neutral to slightly positive about the advertisement. While it's not particularly exciting or something that strongly resonates with my reserved personality (score 3 for liking and thinking it's good), the claim of staying energized does hold some appeal, which is why I find it moderately attractive (score 5).
- Purchase Intention Scores: My intention to purchase the product is low but not non-existent. The ad doesn't convince me enough to be an immediate buyer (score 2 for intending to purchase), but if there were compelling reasons like a good deal or strong recommendation from someone I trust, I might try it out (score 2). It would require more information or persuasion for me to seriously consider buying the product (score 3).
