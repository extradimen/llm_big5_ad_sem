Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I am reserved and not easily swayed by advertisements. However, as a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, I appreciate information that is presented in a clear and professional manner. The ad's claim to help stay energized and look one's best aligns with my neutral stance on artistic interests, suggesting some appeal for personal grooming.
  - **I like the ad**: 3 (Neutral) - While not particularly talkative or outgoing, I do appreciate a well-presented message that could potentially be useful.
  - **I think the ad is interesting**: 4 (Agree slightly) - The promise of energy and looking one's best holds some interest for my practical side.
  - **I believe the ad is good**: 2 (Disagree slightly) - I am skeptical about claims without thorough research, so my belief in the ad's goodness is cautious.
  - **I find the ad attractive**: 5 (Agree moderately) - The combination of energy and appearance improvement could be seen as a professional boost, which appeals to me.
  
- **Purchase intention**: As someone who makes plans and follows through with them, I am methodical in my decision-making process. An advertisement alone would not convince me to purchase without further investigation into the product's claims.
  - **I intend to purchase this product**: 1 (Strongly disagree) - Without thorough research or personal recommendation, immediate intention to buy is low.
  - **I will try to buy this product**: 2 (Disagree slightly) - There might be a slight interest in trying the product if it aligns with my needs and after further evaluation.
  - **I will consider buying this product**: 3 (Neutral) - Given that I am not easily swayed, consideration would require more information or credible reviews before making a decision.
