Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is not particularly appealing to me as an introverted civil servant with a neutral stance on being talkative and outgoing. However, it does claim to provide energy and appearance benefits, which are somewhat attractive (score 5 for "attractive"). I find it moderately good (score 4) but not very interesting (score 2). My liking for the ad is only average at best (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad may have some appeal due to its claims about energy and appearance, my general skepticism towards advertising (as indicated by "Disagree" on being generally trusting) and my tendency to not follow through with plans ("Strongly Disagree" on making plans and following through) make me less inclined to purchase the product. I will consider it if there is a strong recommendation from a trusted source or an attractive offer, but overall, my intention to buy is low (score 1 for "intend"), though I might give it some thought (score 4 for "consider").
