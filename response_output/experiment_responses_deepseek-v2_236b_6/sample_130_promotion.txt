Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking it), interesting enough to hold my attention (score 5), and generally good in its presentation (score 5). The attractiveness of the ad, which suggests that the drink can help me look and feel my best, resonates with my desire to maintain a professional appearance and energy levels, hence a higher score of 6.
- **Purchase intention**: While I find the ad moderately persuasive, my purchase intention is measured by the scores indicating that I would consider buying the product (score 4), but it's not an immediate or strong intent; rather, it falls into the "try" category where I might look into it further if other factors align such as price and availability. The initial score of "intend to purchase" is low at 2, indicating that while the ad has some appeal, it hasn't created a compelling need for immediate action.
