Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 5): As a talkative and outgoing person, I appreciate advertisements that communicate directly. However, my strong agreement with being helpful and unselfish may lead me to question if this product truly delivers on its promise of energy without considering other factors such as health or environmental impact.
  
- The ad is interesting (score 6): My active imagination leads me to find the concept of staying energized throughout the day intriguing, even though I don't necessarily come up with new ideas myself.

- I believe the ad is good (score 4): While I generally trust and am helpful, my worry about thoroughness in job performance makes me skeptical about quick fixes like an energy drink without further information on its ingredients or long-term effects.

- The ad is attractive (score 3): Despite being sociable and talkative, my lack of artistic interests means that the visual appeal of the advertisement doesn't particularly resonate with me.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): As a civil servant living with parents, my monthly income is relatively stable but not high enough for impulsive purchases without careful consideration. Therefore, while the ad has caught my attention, it hasn't convinced me yet to make an immediate decision.
  
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): Due to my tendency towards thoroughness and worry about making mistakes, I would need more information before attempting to purchase such a product.
  
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Given that the advertisement has sparked some interest due to its promise of energy, it is possible that with additional research or positive reviews from trusted sources, I might be willing to give it a try. However, my initial skepticism and desire for thoroughness mean that consideration alone does not guarantee a purchase.
