Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores:
  1. I like the ad (score: 3) - Neutral to slightly positive about liking the ad. The claim of staying energized and looking one's best could be appealing but not a strong draw for an older individual with a reserved personality.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score: 4) - Slightly more positive, as it suggests that the content holds some intrigue or curiosity value.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score: 5) - Moderately positive, acknowledging that the advertisement seems to have a clear message and purpose.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score: 3) - Neutral, as the attractiveness of the ad doesn't strongly resonate with personal preferences or values.

- Purchase Intention Scores:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score: 1) - Strongly disagree, indicating that there is no intention to buy based on the advertisement alone. This could be due to skepticism about energy claims or a general disinterest in such products.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score: 2) - Disagree, showing that while there might not be an immediate plan to purchase, it doesn't rule out consideration if other factors come into play, such as recommendations from trusted sources.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score: 3) - Neutral, suggesting that the product is on the radar for potential consideration but without a strong commitment or enthusiasm.
