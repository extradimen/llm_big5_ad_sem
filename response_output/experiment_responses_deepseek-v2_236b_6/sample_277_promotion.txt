Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am neutral to slightly positive about the advertisement. The ad claims to help with energy and appearance, which are not highly relevant to my priorities as a student and someone focused on artistic interests rather than physical appearance or daily performance enhancement. However, it does have an appeal due to its promise of benefits that could potentially align with my interest in staying engaged creatively (hence the higher score for attractiveness).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase is low because, despite having a neutral attitude towards the ad, I am not convinced that the product aligns with my needs or values. As someone who does not worry much about appearance and energy levels in relation to daily performance, the product's claims do not strongly motivate me to consider purchasing it.
