Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (score: 4): Neutral to slightly positive as it aligns with my outgoing and sociable nature but not overly enthusiastic about liking ads in general.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score: 5): Slightly above neutral due to my active imagination, which makes me find new ideas or products somewhat intriguing.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score: 3): Neutral with a slight lean towards disagreement because while the ad targets energy and appearance, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personal values at this point in time.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score: 6): Agreeing more here as the promise of looking one's best every day is appealing to me, even though I may not be fully convinced about its claims yet.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score: 2): Disagree because while the ad has some appeal, it hasn't created a strong desire for immediate action based on my current needs and budget constraints as a student with limited income.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score: 3): Neutral leaning towards agreement since if there is an opportunity or need arises where staying energized becomes crucial, then I would be open to trying the product out of curiosity without any firm commitment right now.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score: 4): Agreeing as it suggests that I might give more thought into purchasing the drink later on based upon further information or if my circumstances change such as having a higher disposable income which would increase affordability and thus consideration for purchase.
