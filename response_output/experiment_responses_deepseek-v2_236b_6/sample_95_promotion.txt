Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (score 4): While not strongly liking the ad, it is somewhat appealing due to its promise of energy and looking one's best.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 5): The ad captures attention with its claim about staying energized and looking good, which is slightly more than just being neutral.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 3): There is a level of skepticism due to the lack of information on how it achieves these benefits, hence not fully believing in its goodness.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 6): The promise of energy and appearance improvement holds some appeal, especially for someone who might be looking for ways to maintain their vitality.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There is a low intention to immediately buy the product due to potential doubts about its claims and personal preferences that may not align with the advertised benefits.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): The lowest score indicates there's no active effort planned to seek out or purchase the product in the near future.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 4): There is some consideration given that it might be worth exploring further if more information becomes available, but not a strong commitment at this point.
