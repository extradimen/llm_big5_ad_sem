Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat good (score 5) and mildly interesting (score 4), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score 2). The claim about staying energized is appealing as a blue-collar worker, which might be why it scores higher in "good" and "interesting." However, since I am reserved and not very talkative or outgoing, the ad's emphasis on looking one's best doesn't resonate strongly with me (score 3 for liking the ad).
  
- **Purchase Intention**: Despite finding the ad somewhat appealing, my intention to purchase is low. As someone who values thoroughness in their job and makes plans that I follow through with, I am likely to research any product thoroughly before purchasing it. The advertisement alone does not provide enough information for me to make a decision (score 1). However, if further information or recommendations from trusted sources were available, I might be more inclined to consider buying the product (scores 2 and 3).
