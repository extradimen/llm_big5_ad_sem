Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a generally positive attitude towards the advertisement. While not strongly liking it (score 3), I find it interesting (score 4) and good (score 4), especially because it aligns with my need for energy as someone who is busy in a managerial role. The ad's attractiveness scores higher (5) because it appeals to both staying energized and looking one's best, which resonates with my desire to maintain stability and appearance.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase the product is moderate. I am considering trying it out (score 2), as energy is important for my job, but not strongly intending to buy immediately (1). However, the consideration of buying increases to a 4 because if proven credible and effective, the product could be beneficial in managing both personal well-being and professional performance.
