Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 5): As an outgoing and sociable person who is generally trusting and talkative, I find the advertisement appealing but not overly so. It's a positive message that aligns with my desire to stay energized and look good, which could be important for social interactions in my blue-collar job environment.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 6): The claim of staying energized appeals to me as an active person who values sociability and being talkative. It's a message that catches my attention and seems relevant to my lifestyle.
- I believe the ad is good (score 4): While I find it interesting, I am not entirely convinced of its goodness. The advertisement lacks specifics on how exactly the drink helps with energy levels or appearance, which leaves some doubt in my mind about its effectiveness.
- I find the ad attractive (score 3): The attractiveness of the ad is somewhat limited for me because, although it promises benefits that are appealing to my sociable nature, there's a lack of detail and originality that would make it more compelling.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): While I am not strongly inclined to immediately buy the product based on the ad alone, it does pique my interest enough to consider further investigation or perhaps discussing with friends before making a decision.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): The intention to actively seek out and purchase the product is low at this point because of the skepticism regarding its claims without more information.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): There's enough interest generated by the ad for me to keep it in mind as a potential purchase, especially if additional information or endorsements from trusted sources become available that can help validate the advertised benefits.
