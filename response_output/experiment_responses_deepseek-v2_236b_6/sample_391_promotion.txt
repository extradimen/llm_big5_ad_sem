Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (Score: 3) - Neutral to mildly positive feelings about the advertisement as it doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved and artistic personality but neither does it repel me.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4) - Slightly more than neutral, finding some interest in the claim of energy boost, which could be relevant for an office worker.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score: 5) - Moderately positive; it's a functional message that might appeal to my practical side as an office worker.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score: 2) - Slightly below neutral, as it doesn't particularly align with my artistic interests or provide compelling visuals or concepts for me personally.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1) - Low intention because the ad hasn't created a strong desire in me to seek out and buy the product immediately, despite its functional claim.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score: 1) - Similarly low, as there is no immediate plan or effort to actively search for this product based on the advertisement alone.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score: 2) - Slightly higher than not considering at all; it's possible that if the product came across my path in a store or was recommended by someone else, I might entertain the idea of purchasing it.
