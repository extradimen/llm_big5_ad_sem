Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately appealing (score 3 for liking), somewhat interesting (score 4), and good in terms of its production quality (score 4). The ad is attractive to me, as it speaks about energy and looking one's best, which aligns with my concerns about staying energized at this age (score 5).
- **Purchase intention:** Despite finding the ad somewhat appealing, I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product immediately (score 1 for intend). However, I might try to buy it if there is a good offer or recommendation from someone I trust (score 2 for try), and I will consider buying it as an option in the future (score 3 for consider).
