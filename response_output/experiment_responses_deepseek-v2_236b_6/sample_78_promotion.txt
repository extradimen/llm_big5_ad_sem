Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a talkative and outgoing person who enjoys being helpful, I find the ad somewhat appealing as it promises energy and looking one's best, which could resonate with my desire to be sociable and presentable. However, being reserved and having few artistic interests means that flashy or overly creative ads may not fully capture my attention. Thus, while I think the ad is interesting (5) and good (4), it's only moderately attractive (3).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding the ad somewhat appealing, as a civil servant with a postgraduate degree and a reserved personality, I am more likely to make informed decisions based on thorough research rather than impulsive purchases. Therefore, my purchase intentions are low: I might consider buying it if there's solid evidence of its benefits (3), but without strong intent or immediate plans to try the product (1).
