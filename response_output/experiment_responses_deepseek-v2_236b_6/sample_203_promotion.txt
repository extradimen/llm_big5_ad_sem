Explanation of scores:
- The ad is moderately attractive and interesting to me. It's a good advertisement but not something I particularly like or dislike strongly (scores for attitude are between neutral and agree).
- While the ad does catch my attention with its claim about energy and appearance, as someone who values thoroughness and follows through on plans, I would need more information before making a purchase decision. Therefore, my intention to buy is only at a considering stage, not yet an intent or definite try (scores for purchase intention are between neutral and agree).
