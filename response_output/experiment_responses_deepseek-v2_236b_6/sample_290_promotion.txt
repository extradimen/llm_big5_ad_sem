Explanation:
- Attitude towards the advertisement: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. While it doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved personality (scoring a 3 for 'I like the ad'), I find it somewhat interesting (4) and can acknowledge that it is good in terms of its message (2). The attractiveness of the ad, which may appeal to others looking for an energy boost and appearance enhancement, scores higher at 5.
- Purchase intention: My intentions are low to consider purchasing the product. As a civil servant with original ideas but not particularly focused on personal image or energetic lifestyle, I am least likely to intend to purchase (1), more likely to try if circumstances align (2), and open to considering it based on further information (3).
