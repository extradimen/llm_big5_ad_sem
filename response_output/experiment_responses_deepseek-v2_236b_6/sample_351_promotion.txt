Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (score: 3) - Neutral to slightly positive feelings about the advertisement due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which aligns with the desire for good presentation in a civil servant role.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score: 4) - Slightly above neutral because it presents a clear benefit that could be relevant to daily life.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score: 4) - Similarly, the advertisement seems positive and has a message that can appeal to many people, including someone who values thoroughness in their job.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score: 5) - A slightly higher score because it offers an aspirational aspect of looking one's best, which is appealing even if not strongly associated with artistic interests.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score: 2) - There is some interest in trying the product due to its advertised benefits, but it doesn't guarantee a strong intention to buy without further information or consideration.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score: 2) - Similar to above, there is an openness to considering the purchase if other factors such as price and availability align favorably.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score: 3) - A moderate score indicating that while not immediately committed to purchasing, there is a willingness to think about it more seriously after further evaluation of its claims and personal utility.
