Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (score 4): The advertisement is moderately appealing to me due to my outgoing and sociable nature, but it doesn't strongly resonate with my artistic interests or originality.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 5): While not particularly innovative in its message, the promise of energy might be intriguing for someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 3): The ad's claim to help with daily energy is somewhat credible but lacks detail or evidence to fully convince me of its goodness.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 2): Attractiveness in advertising often comes from an emotional connection or aesthetic appeal, which this ad does not strongly provide for my preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 1): With a strong disagreement on making plans and following through with them, combined with a tendency towards carelessness, there is little intention to actually follow up on the advertisement's call to action.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): Similar reasoning as above; without a solid plan or commitment to purchasing habits, trying to buy the product seems unlikely.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 2): There is some potential for consideration due to my talkative and outgoing nature, which might make me more open to social consumption of such products, but it remains a low likelihood without stronger conviction or personal need articulated by the ad.
