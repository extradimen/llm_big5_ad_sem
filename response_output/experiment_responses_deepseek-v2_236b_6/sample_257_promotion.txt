Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately attractive (score 6) and somewhat interesting (score 5), but my overall belief in its goodness is only average (score 3). My liking for the ad is also moderate (score 4).
- Purchase intention: While the ad has caught my attention, my intention to purchase is low (score 1). I may consider buying it if there are other factors such as price and availability (score 2), but overall, I am not strongly inclined to buy just yet (score 3).
