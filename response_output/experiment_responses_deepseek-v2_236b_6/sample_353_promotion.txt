Explanation of the scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is moderately appealing (score of 4 for liking), somewhat interesting to me as a civil servant who values thoroughness (score of 5). I find it acceptable but not particularly good or attractive, likely because my reserved nature and lack of artistic interests do not strongly resonate with an energy drink's promise of looking one's best every day.
- Purchase intention: While the ad does not strongly persuade me to purchase the product due to its focus on being outgoing (which I am not), I might consider it if there is a need for extra energy, but I would not actively seek out or plan to buy it immediately. My trust in others and general helpfulness do not significantly influence my decision here.
