Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 3) and finds it somewhat interesting (score 4), but does not strongly believe it's good (score 2). It is considered attractive to some extent (score 5), which might be due to the creative aspect that aligns with having an active imagination.
- **Purchase intention**: There is a low intention to purchase this product right away (score 1), but there is a willingness to try and potentially consider buying it in the future (scores 2 and 3). This suggests some openness to the possibility of purchasing, depending on further information or consideration.
