Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a 50-59 year old female with an outgoing personality who agrees to make plans and follow through with them (Strongly Agree), I find the ad somewhat interesting (4) and attractive (5). However, my neutral stance on being generally trusting leads me to only moderately believe the ad is good (2) and slightly like it (3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding some aspects of the ad appealing, my demographic profile as a student with limited income and living with parents suggests that I may not be in the market for such products. Therefore, my intention to purchase (1), try to buy (2), and consider buying (3) are all low, reflecting a lack of strong interest or need for the product based on my current circumstances.
