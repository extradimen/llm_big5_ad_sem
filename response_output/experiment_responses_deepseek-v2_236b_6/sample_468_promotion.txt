Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is moderately liked (score of 5) because it suggests a benefit that aligns with my talkative and outgoing nature. It's somewhat interesting (4), as it presents an energy boost which could be appealing for social interactions, but not exceptionally good (3) or particularly attractive (4).
- **Purchase intention:** While I am not strongly intending to purchase the product (1), I might try to buy it if there is a strong recommendation from others (2), and will consider buying it based on further information (3), especially since my tendency towards being helpful and unselfish with others might influence me to try products that could benefit others as well.
