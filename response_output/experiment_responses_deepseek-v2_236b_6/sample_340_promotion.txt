Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 5 for liking), it's moderately interesting to me (score 4), but I wouldn't say it's particularly good or stands out as exceptional (score 3). However, I do find it visually attractive and engaging (score 6).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is somewhat appealing, my intention to purchase the product is not strong. I would be open to considering buying it if other factors align, such as reviews or price point (score 3 for consideration), but I'm not actively planning to buy it right away (score 1 for intent) and won't go out of my way to find it immediately (score 2 for trying).
