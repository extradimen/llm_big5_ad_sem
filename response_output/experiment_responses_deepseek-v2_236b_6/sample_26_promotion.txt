Explanation: As a virtual person with the given demographic profile and personality traits, I have evaluated the advertisement based on my perceived values and preferences. The ad's claim of staying energized and looking one's best appeals to me as an outgoing and sociable individual who likes to maintain a good appearance. However, being helpful and unselfish, I am also cautious about spending money that could be better used elsewhere. My scores reflect this balance:

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likable (5), quite interesting (6), somewhat good (5), but only slightly attractive (4). This suggests a positive yet critical view of the ad's appeal.
- **Purchase intention**: While I am open to considering the product (4), my intent to purchase is low (3) and willingness to try it out is also limited (2). These scores indicate that while the ad has caught my attention, there are other priorities in terms of spending, especially given my income level.
