  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Agree more strongly as it appeals to my outgoing personality and desire for social appeal.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agree because while it has a positive message, there is no clear evidence of its claims.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 4): Agree moderately as it aligns with my values of wanting to look and feel good for daily activities.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards disagree because while I may consider it, there is no strong intention without more information or personal experience with the product.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): Strongly disagree as my income level and cautious nature make me less likely to impulsively try a new product based on an ad alone.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agree because if the product proves reliable through word-of-mouth or other trusted sources, I might consider it within my budget constraints.
