Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to appeal to my outgoing and sociable nature with its promise of staying energized. However, as someone who values thoroughness and might be skeptical about claims for looking one's best every day, I am not entirely convinced by the ad's message. Therefore, while I find it somewhat attractive (score 6), I am neutral on whether it is good or interesting (scores 3 and 5) and only moderately like it (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile, including a modest monthly income and responsibilities as a civil servant, I would approach purchasing decisions with care. The ad does not provide enough information to make me intend to buy the product immediately (score 1), but it piques my interest enough that I might try to explore more about the product before making a decision (score 2). Ultimately, I will consider buying the product if further research or reviews support its claims (score 3).
