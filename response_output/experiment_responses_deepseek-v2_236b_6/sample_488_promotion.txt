Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it promises energy and looking one's best, which could appeal to my demographic as a blue-collar worker who values practical benefits. However, while I think it is interesting enough to catch attention (score 5), I am not entirely convinced of its goodness or quality (score 3). My agreement with liking the ad is neutral; it doesn't strongly resonate but isn't off-putting either (score 4).
  
- **Purchase intention:** The advertisement does pique my interest enough to consider buying the product (score 3), and if I were in a store, I might pick it up for closer inspection (score 2). However, there is not yet sufficient motivation or intent for me to actively seek out this product specifically to purchase it immediately (score 1).
