Explanation of Scores:
- The advertisement seems appealing to me as a talkative and outgoing individual who values staying energized. However, I am also critical and reserved in my judgments. Therefore, while I find the ad interesting (score 6) and somewhat attractive (score 5), I do not fully agree that it is good or likeable without more information about how the product delivers on its claims (scores 4 and 5).
- Regarding purchase intention, as a student with limited income who makes plans but can be careless at times, I am unlikely to immediately intend to buy this product (score 2), but I might try it out if there is an opportunity or discount that aligns with my budget (score 3) and consider buying it further down the line depending on reviews and personal experience (score 4).
