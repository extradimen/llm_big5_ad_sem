Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral agreement. The ad is not particularly appealing to my artistic interests but it's not unlikable either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because of its claim about energy and appearance, which might be relevant to someone in their late teens or early twenties who is sociable and outgoing.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral agreement again. It's a standard advertisement with a common message but not necessarily outstanding.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly higher than neutral because it touches on two areas of potential interestâ€”energy for being outgoing and looking one's best, which could be appealing to my demographic profile.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low intent because while the ad is somewhat interesting, there isn't enough information or a strong personal need to immediately want to buy it.
- I will try to buy this product (score 3): Slightly higher than low but still not very committed. It might be considered if encountered in a store and the price seems reasonable.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): Higher consideration because of the energy claim, which aligns with my outgoing personality trait. However, without more information on how it helps "look your best," the interest is not very strong.
