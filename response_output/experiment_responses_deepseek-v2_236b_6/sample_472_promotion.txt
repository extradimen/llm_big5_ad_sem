Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (4): Neutral to slightly positive as it aligns with my outgoing and sociable nature but also considering my neutral stance on being helpful and trusting.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (5): More positive because of my agreeance on having original ideas and few artistic interests, which makes me intrigued by new products that claim innovation.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Slightly negative due to my strong disagreement with doing a thorough job and making plans, which might make me skeptical about the claims in the advertisement.
  4. I find the ad attractive (6): Positive as it appeals to my agreeance on being talkative and outgoing, making the promise of energy and looking good resonate with my personality.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree because although the advertisement is somewhat appealing, my skepticism about thoroughness and planning makes me unlikely to immediately commit to a purchase.
  2. I will try to buy this product (2): Neutral leaning towards disagreement as while the ad has caught my interest, my tendency for careful consideration before making purchases prevails.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): Agreeance here indicates that although I am not immediately convinced, the advertisement's promise of energy and looking good is something I would keep in mind for future considerations, especially if more information or positive reviews become available.
