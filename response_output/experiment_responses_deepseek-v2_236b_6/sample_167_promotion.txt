Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a reserved individual with an agreeance on being helpful and trusting, I find the ad to be moderately interesting (score 4) and somewhat attractive (score 5), as it appeals to the desire for energy and looking one's best. However, my neutral stance on doing a thorough job and making plans suggests that while I might not strongly dislike the ad (scores 3 for like and good), I also do not find it particularly compelling or unique in its message.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my profile as a civil servant with a decent income, there is some interest in products that could improve daily life, hence the moderate scores on purchase intention (2 for intend to purchase, 3 for try to buy, and 4 for considering buying). However, my reserved nature and tendency to worry suggest that I would likely take time to consider such purchases rather than making an impulsive decision. My agreement on being original and coming up with new ideas indicates a potential openness to innovative products, but this is tempered by the fact that I have few artistic interests, which might limit the appeal of lifestyle-enhancing products like the one advertised.
