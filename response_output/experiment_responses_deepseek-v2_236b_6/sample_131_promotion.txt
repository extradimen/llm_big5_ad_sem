Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly appealing but it's not unlikable either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Somewhat agree. It catches attention with its promise of energy and looking one's best, which can be intriguing for anyone regardless of age or background.
- I believe the ad is good (score 5): Agree to an extent. The advertisement seems to fulfill its purpose by promoting a product that claims benefits, although credibility would need further evaluation.
- I find the ad attractive (score 2): Disagree slightly. While it may appeal to some based on its message, as someone who is reserved and not particularly drawn to artistic interests, the attractiveness of the ad is less significant.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. Given my age and personality traits such as being reserved and making plans with difficulty, immediate intent to buy is low.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards disagreement. There might be some curiosity about the product's claims but not enough motivation for active seeking of purchase.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Slightly agree. It's possible that if further information or recommendations from trusted sources were available, consideration could increase. However, being generally trusting and emotionally stable means decisions are made with some level of caution.
