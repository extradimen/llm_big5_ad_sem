Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately attractive (score 5) and somewhat interesting (score 4), but I don't strongly believe that it is good (score 2) or particularly like it (score 3).
- Purchase intention: While the ad doesn't have a strong appeal, it does suggest benefits that could be relevant. However, my low score for "intend to purchase" (1) indicates that I am not planning to buy it immediately, but with a slightly higher score on "try to buy" (1), there is a slight inclination to potentially seek out more information or consider the product in future if circumstances change. The middle score for "consider buying" (2) suggests an openness to considering the product based on additional factors such as recommendations from others or further convincing evidence of its benefits.
