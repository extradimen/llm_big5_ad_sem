Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (score 4): The ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing to a managerial employee who values efficiency and presentation, but there is some reservation due to being reserved and not overly outgoing or talkative.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 5): As someone with an active imagination and original ideas, the claim of staying energized for daily tasks holds interest.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 6): The combination of trust in others and a tendency to make plans and follow through suggests that if the product seems credible, it could be seen as a beneficial addition to one's routine.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 3): While not entirely unattractive, there may be some skepticism due to potential worry about false claims or lack of thoroughness in verifying such benefits.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There is an intention to try the product as it aligns with daily work demands and personal values, but not a strong commitment to buy immediately.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): The desire to test the product's claims indicates interest without full conviction.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 3): Considering purchase reflects an open-minded approach to new ideas and products, but with a cautious stance due to potential carelessness or concern about thoroughness of product benefits.
