Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I have a somewhat neutral to mildly positive view of the ad. It's not particularly appealing or unappealing, but it does seem interesting and potentially good in its messaging about energy and looking one's best, which aligns with my need as a blue-collar worker for sustained energy throughout the day. However, the attractiveness of the ad is low because I am skeptical about how much a drink can actually deliver on these promises.

- **Purchase intention**: My intent to purchase this product is quite low due to my financial constraints and skepticism about the claims made in the advertisement. While I might consider buying it if circumstances were different, at present, I would only try to buy it if there was some sort of promotion or discount that significantly reduced its cost. The initial score for intending to purchase is very low because of these factors.
