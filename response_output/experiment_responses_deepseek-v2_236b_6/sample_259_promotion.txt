Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 4) because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which is appealing. The ad seems interesting enough to capture my attention (score 5), but whether it's "good" in terms of its message or execution is more neutral for me (score 3). I don't find the ad particularly attractive as it doesn't align with my reserved and unselfish nature; therefore, I give a low score (2) on attractiveness.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad does not strongly persuade me to buy the product due to its general appeal, which is somewhat at odds with my personality traits, I am open to considering it (score 3). However, there's no strong intention or commitment to try or intend to purchase the product right now (scores 1 and 2 respectively).
