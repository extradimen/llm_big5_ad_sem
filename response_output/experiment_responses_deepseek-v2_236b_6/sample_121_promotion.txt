Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat interesting and considered good in terms of its message, but it's not particularly attractive to me. I am neutral about liking the ad, as it doesn't strongly appeal or repel me.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad isn't compelling enough for me to intend to purchase the product immediately, it might be something I would consider if I were in need of an energy boost and looking for options. However, given my tendency towards carelessness (Strongly Agree) and not doing a thorough job (Disagree), the immediate intention to try or buy is low, as reflected by scores 1 and 1 respectively.
