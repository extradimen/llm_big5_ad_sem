Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive feelings about the ad. It's not something that particularly stands out as likable but it doesn't repel me either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly more inclined towards finding the ad somewhat engaging or intriguing, which could be due to the promise of staying energized and looking one's best.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): A slightly negative leaning here as it suggests skepticism about whether the ad lives up to its claims without evidence or a strong appeal to my values.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): The highest score in this category, indicating that while there may be reservations about the 'goodness' of the ad, there is an attraction to the idea presented, particularly if it aligns with looking one's best, which could resonate with personal or cultural values.

- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): This indicates a low intention to actually buy the product right away but opens up the possibility for consideration in the future if more information is provided that addresses skepticism or fits better into my lifestyle and preferences.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): The lowest score here suggests very little motivation to actively seek out purchasing the product, possibly due to doubts about its effectiveness or relevance to personal needs.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): A middle ground where there is an acknowledgment of potential interest but with conditions that would need to be met for a more serious consideration of purchase, such as additional information, reviews, or a change in circumstances that make the product more appealing.
