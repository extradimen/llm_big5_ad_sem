Alright, let's break down my thought process as I evaluate this advertisement. 

First, the ad is about a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. My demographic profile includes being a blue-collar worker in China with certain personality traits. Let me see how each aspect might influence my reaction.

Starting with the attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** – I'm not sure if I'd like it. The message is positive, but since I'm reserved and don't have strong artistic interests, I might not find it particularly engaging. So maybe a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – The idea of energy and looking good is appealing, especially for someone in their late twenties. Maybe 4.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** – I worry a lot and tend to be thorough, so I might be skeptical about health claims without evidence. Perhaps 3.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** – The message aligns with some of my values, but not enough to make it very attractive. Maybe 3.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – I'm practical and might not feel a strong need for such a drink. So maybe 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** – If the ad makes me curious, I might consider trying it once. Maybe 3.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** – It's possible if there's more information or positive reviews, but on its own, probably a 4.

Overall, my scores are based on balancing the appeal of staying energized and looking good against my cautious nature and practical background as a blue-collar worker.
