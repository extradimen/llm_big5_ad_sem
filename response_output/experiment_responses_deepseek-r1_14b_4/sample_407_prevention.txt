Alright, let me try to break down how I arrived at these scores. First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." As a civil servant with a busy schedule, staying alert and presentable is important.

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**: The message is clear about the consequences of not using the product, which resonates because I value looking sharp and feeling energetic for work. However, it's quite direct, so maybe not the most likable. I'll give a 4.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: It's straightforward but doesn't really capture my interest much. There's no emotional appeal or creativity here. So, a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The message is simple and to the point, which can be effective for some people. But it lacks depth and might not make me trust the product fully. A 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: It doesn't really stand out or grab my attention creatively. So, a 3 on this one.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The ad targets my needs for staying alert and looking good, which is important. But I'm not sure if the drink alone can make that much of a difference. A 4.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without more evidence or a compelling reason, I might not rush out to try it. So, a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's something I'd keep in mind, especially if others find it effective. A 4 feels right here.
