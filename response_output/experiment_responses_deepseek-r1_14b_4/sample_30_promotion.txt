Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. First, the ad claims that the drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day. Given my background as a 40-49-year-old office worker from China with a bachelor's degree, I'm looking for something practical yet effective.

Starting with my personality traits: I'm reserved (strongly agree) but also helpful and unselfish (agree). However, I generally distrust people (strongly disagree), which might make me skeptical of such claims. The ad is positive, but without specific evidence or details, it feels a bit too good to be true.

I consider each attitude question:
1. **Like the ad**: Neutral (4/7). It's not unappealing, but I'm not drawn to it either.
2. **Interesting**: Disagree (3/7). The message is clear but lacks depth or unique appeal.
3. **Good**: Neutral (4/7). It serves its purpose but doesn't stand out as exceptional.
4. **Attractive**: Disagree (3/7). The visuals might not strongly engage me.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: Disagree (3/7). Without trust in the product, intent is low.
2. **Try to buy**: Neutral (4/7). I'm somewhat open but not convinced.
3. **Consider buying**: Agree (5/7). It's on my radar, but I need more convincing.

Overall, while the ad isn't dislikeable, it doesn't resonate strongly enough with me to drive a purchase decision without further information.
