Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese male in my late twenties with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker and currently divorced. My monthly income is under 15 million VND. Let me think through how each aspect of the ad resonates with me based on my personality.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

I'm talkative but not outgoing, so I might appreciate a product that can help me maintain energy to interact without being too social. Being reserved, maybe the idea of looking good could be appealing because it's something internal. However, I don't see myself as helpful or unselfish, so products aimed at personal benefit rather than others might not hit home.

I'm generally trusting? Not really; I tend to disagree with that trait. So ads need to be credible. This ad doesn't provide evidence of the drink's effectiveness, which makes me skeptical. 

Sometimes rude: Maybe this drink could help with energy in a way that's needed for my job, but the idea of looking good every day might not be top priority for someone working physically as a blue-collar worker. 

Thorough job: I do thorough work, so maybe if this drink actually works, it would be something I stick to. But without evidence, I'm neutral on its effectiveness.

Making plans and following through is something I don't usually do, so the ad's message about daily routines might not strongly influence me. Being careless sometimes could mean I overlook ads that don't directly impact my immediate needs.

I get nervous easily but worry a lot, which might make me more cautious towards health products unless they're proven. Emotionally stable, but if this drink can help with energy and stress, maybe it's appealing. Having an active imagination and being original could mean I'm open to new ideas, but I also have few artistic interests, so the ad's message might not be very engaging.

Looking at attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like it? The tagline is catchy, but without trust or proof, maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's about energy and looking good, which are relatable to some extent, maybe a 4.
3. Good as an ad: It's simple but lacks depth, so perhaps a 3.
4. Attractive: The visuals matter, but the text alone doesn't do much for me, maybe a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase? Without trust or evidence, probably not, so a 2.
2. Try it? Maybe if I see others using it, a 3.
3. Consider buying? It's on my radar but not a priority, a 4.

Wait, let me check each score again. For ad attitude:

- Like: The message is positive, but without trust, maybe a 3.
- Interesting: Relatable points, so 4.
- Good: Not great, but okay, so 3.
- Attractive: Maybe the visuals are nice, so 4.

Purchase intention:

- Intend: Probably not, 2.
- Try: Neutral to positive if others recommend, maybe a 3.
- Consider: It's considered but not urgent, 4.

Hmm, I think that makes sense. So scores would be [3,4,3,4] for attitude and [2,3,4] for intention.
