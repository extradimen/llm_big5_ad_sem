Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 28-year-old Chinese woman with my specific background and personality. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, that sounds pretty general but appealing. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe this is targeting busy professionals who need energy? But wait, do I feel that way?

Looking at my personality traits, I tend to agree that I am sometimes rude to others (Agree) and get careless a lot (Strongly Agree). Also, I don't have an active imagination and have few artistic interests. So, I'm more practical.

The ad's main points are about energy and looking good. Energy is important for my job, but do I think this drink will actually help? The ad doesn't provide any evidence or specifics on how it works. That makes me skeptical because I tend to be careless with such claims—maybe I don't take it seriously?

But then again, the drink sounds convenient and something that many people would want. It's a common desire to look good and feel energized. So maybe it's relatable. However, without trust in the product, my belief in its effectiveness is low.

For purchase intention: I might not intend to buy it immediately because there are so many similar products out there. But if I were considering health drinks, this could be one of them—so perhaps I would consider buying it after trying others or seeing more evidence.

I need to score each question based on how I feel about the ad and whether I'd buy the product.
