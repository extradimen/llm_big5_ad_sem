Alright, let's break this down. I'm a Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor’s degree, working as a blue-collar worker and currently divorced. My monthly income is between 16,000,000–25,000,000 VND. From my personality traits, I tend to be outgoing but not talkative, helpful, planful, thorough, and emotionally stable. However, I sometimes feel rude, get nervous easily (though disagree on that), worry a lot, and have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message seems to target energy levels and social appearance, which could resonate with someone looking to maintain their image and stamina. 

Considering my personality, being helpful and unselfish makes me consider how products can benefit others. However, I'm not particularly imaginative or original, so the ad's message is straightforward but might not engage me deeply. My thoroughness means I'd look for more details before trusting it.

My cautious nature (strongly disagree on trusting ads) might make me skeptical of such claims without evidence. Also, being a blue-collar worker with an income in that range suggests I'm price-sensitive and value-conscious. The ad doesn't provide specific benefits or proof, which could be a drawback.

Purchase intention-wise, while the ad touches on important aspects like energy and appearance, lacking concrete information might make me hesitant to try it. However, my planning nature means if there's follow-up info, I might reconsider.
