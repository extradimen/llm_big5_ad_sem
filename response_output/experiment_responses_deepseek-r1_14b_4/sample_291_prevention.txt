Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The ad is targeting someone who might be concerned about appearing energetic and presentable. Considering my personality traits, I'm reserved (Agree) but also worry a lot (Strongly Agree). This makes me more susceptible to ads that address potential personal shortcomings.

For the first part, evaluating my attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: The message touches on feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable. I can see how this might make someone feel they need the drink to improve their appearance and energy levels. However, since I'm reserved, I might not feel a strong emotional connection, so maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The concept is straightforward but effective in highlighting potential negative outcomes without the product. It's a classic fear appeal strategy. I find it somewhat compelling, so perhaps a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: While the message is clear, it might be too simplistic and could come off as manipulative. My tendency to worry a lot makes me cautious about such appeals, leading me to score this lower at 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual aspect isn't specified, but the tagline is catchy. However, my reserved nature means I'm not immediately drawn in, so maybe a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My generally trusting nature (Strongly Agree) might make me more open to trying it, but I'm also careful about spending. The ad's focus on tiredness and dullness could resonate, but I wouldn't be immediately convinced. So, a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without strong evidence or personal experience, the intention is moderate. Maybe a 3 here as I'm not sure yet.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: The ad does make me think about whether the drink could help, so consideration is there. A 5 seems appropriate as it's on my radar but not a definite purchase.
