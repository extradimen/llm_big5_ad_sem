Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it's for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day.

First, let's break down my own profile to see what might influence my reaction. I'm over 60, from China, female, with a bachelor's degree, currently a student, divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved, helpful, emotionally stable, sometimes rude, thorough, careless, and having few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad, it seems to target people who want energy and appear better. Since I'm over 60, maybe staying energized is a selling point. However, looking my best might not be as high a priority for me compared to someone younger. 

I also tend to be reserved and helpful, which means I value practicality and maybe don't get excited about ads that are too flashy. The ad seems straightforward but maybe lacks depth in how it connects with me personally.

Thinking about the attitudes towards the ad:

1. **Like the ad**: The message is positive, but does it resonate with me? Since I'm more reserved, I might not feel a strong emotional connection. So, maybe a 3 here.
   
2. **Interesting**: Does the ad offer anything new or intriguing? It's common for energy drinks, so perhaps neutral on interestingness. Maybe a 4.

3. **Good**: As a non-native speaker, the wording seems clear and positive. I don't see any issues, so maybe a 5.

4. **Attractive**: The ad is simple but might not be visually appealing enough for me. Maybe a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy**: I'm more practical. Since I'm a student on a budget, the price matters. Without knowing the cost, maybe neutral. So, a 4.
   
2. **Try to buy**: Trying new products isn't something I do often because of past experiences where it might not be worth the money. Maybe a 3.

3. **Consider buying**: It's an option if it fits my needs and budget. Since staying energized could be useful, perhaps a 5.

I should make sure these scores reflect how I feel based on being reserved, practical, and concerned about cost.
