Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a 50-59-year-old single woman from China with a high school education and a managerial job earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix of agreeable and disagreeable aspects.

First, the advertisement says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate how this ad resonates with me as a consumer.

Starting with my attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Considering I'm outgoing (Agree) but not talkative (Neutral), maybe the ad's message is positive enough, but the focus on energy might not appeal as much since I already have a busy schedule. So, maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad highlights staying energized and looking good, which are important, especially for someone active like me. It's relevant, so perhaps a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   I'm cautious (Strongly Disagree on trusting), so believing in the ad might be lower. Maybe a 4 because it sounds too generic.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Being original and creative (Strongly Agree) but not artistic (Strongly Disagree), maybe the visuals are appealing, so a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   I worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and tend to be thorough (Disagree). The ad doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence, so my intent is low—maybe a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Since the message targets daily energy, which could fit my lifestyle, but without more info, I'm hesitant to try—perhaps a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   It's somewhat relevant, so considering is possible if I see it somewhere else, maybe a 5.
