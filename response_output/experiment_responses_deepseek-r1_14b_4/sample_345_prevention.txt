Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this virtual person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down the demographic and personality traits first.

The person is from China, male, between 30-39 years old, has a bachelor's degree, works as a blue-collar worker, is divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's not very talkative but agrees he's outgoing; he doesn't consider himself reserved or helpful, which might make him more self-focused. He trusts people but sometimes worries a lot and can be careless. He's thorough in his work, comes up with new ideas, but isn't particularly artistic.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the main message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. It's targeting potential negative outcomes if they don't use the product.

Considering his personality, he's careful in his work (thorough job), which might make him cautious about products that claim to prevent tiredness, especially since he earns less than 15 million VND a monthâ€”so cost could be a factor. He tends to worry a lot and is sometimes careless, but he also makes plans and follows through when neutral.

He's original and comes up with new ideas, so the ad's message is somewhat straightforward, not necessarily innovative. It might not appeal much to him since it doesn't offer something unique beyond the obvious benefits.

He isn't talkative but is outgoing. The ad is a prevention-focused message, which is more about avoiding negative outcomes rather than promoting positive ones. He's trusting but gets nervous easily and worries a lot, so he might be concerned about the product's effectiveness without strong evidence.

His artistic interests are low, so any creative aspects of the ad might not resonate with him much. However, being original himself, he might appreciate a unique selling point if it were present.

In terms of purchase intention, even though he worries a lot and is thorough at work, which might make him consider the product's benefits, his carelessness and lower income could make him less likely to prioritize this drink over other expenses. Plus, without strong evidence or a compelling reason beyond avoiding tiredness and looking dull, it's unclear if he'd feel the need to purchase it.

So, when evaluating the ad, he might not find it particularly interesting or good because it doesn't speak to his strengths in originality or outgoing nature. It's straightforward but lacks the flair that might engage him more. Therefore, his attitude towards the ad would be neutral to slightly negative, and his purchase intention would also be low.

For the ad attitude scores: He's neutral on liking it (maybe a 4), finds it somewhat interesting (3), thinks it's okay as good (3), and not very attractive (2). For purchase intentions: He doesn't intend to buy (1), won't try, but might consider if circumstances change (3).
