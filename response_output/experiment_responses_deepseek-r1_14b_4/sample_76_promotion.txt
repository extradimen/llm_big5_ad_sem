Alright, let me break down how I came up with these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: 
1. **Like the ad (4/7):** The ad's message about energy and looking good is positive, but given my reserved nature, I'm not overly enthusiastic.
2. **Interesting (5/7):** It's a common claim, so while it's interesting, it doesn't stand out much.
3. **Good (5/7):** The message is clear, but without strong emotional appeal, it feels adequate rather than excellent.
4. **Attractive (6/7):** The visuals and claims are appealing, making it more attractive despite my reserved personality.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (3/7):** While the benefits are good, I'm not immediately convinced without more info.
2. **Try to buy (4/7):** A bit more on the fence but leaning towards considering it.
3. **Consider buying (5/7):** The idea of energy and appearance is appealing enough to make me think about it.

Overall, the ad resonates somewhat due to its clear benefits, but my personality traits like being reserved and cautious mean I'm not fully sold yet.
