Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad: I scored it a 3 for liking because while the message about staying energized and looking good is appealing, the phrasing feels a bit generic and overused in ads. It doesn't stand out enough to make me like it strongly.

For interesting (2), I gave a 4 because the idea of a drink that combines energy with appearance is somewhat intriguing, but without specific details or a compelling presentation, it doesn't captivate me much.

Believing the ad (3) got a 5. The claims are positive and relevant to daily life, but there's a lack of evidence or specifics about how the product achieves these benefits, making me somewhat skeptical.

Attractiveness (4) scored a 6 because the core message is appealing, focusing on energy and appearance which are important to many people. However, without seeing the actual ad visuals or more compelling language, it doesn't hit the top scores.

Moving to purchase intention: Intend to purchase (1) is a 3. While the benefits are attractive, I need more information about what makes this drink different from others. Without that, my interest isn't high enough to strongly intend buying it.

Trying the product (2) received a 4 because if the ad provides some compelling reason or if I see it multiple times, I might be motivated to try it, but it's not an immediate decision.

Considering buying (3) is a 5. The message does resonate on a basic level, so under the right circumstances, like seeing more ads or getting recommendations, I would consider purchasing it.

Overall, my scores reflect that while the ad has some appeal and relevance, there's room for improvement in specifics and presentation to make it more effective.
