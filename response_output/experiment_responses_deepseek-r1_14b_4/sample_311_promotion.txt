Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 30-39-year-old Chinese female with a postgraduate degree, currently a student living with her parents and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being helpful, thorough, planning ahead, but also sometimes rude, getting nervous easily, worrying a lot, having an active imagination, and few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll consider my attitude toward the ad. Let's go through each point:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The ad seems positive, highlighting energy and looking good. However, since I'm a student with limited income, the price might be a concern. Also, I tend to worry a lot about health benefits and whether such claims are credible. My personality traits make me cautious and thorough, so I wouldn't immediately like it without more information.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The message is clear but maybe not very compelling for someone who's already managing stress through other means. It doesn't tap into my imagination much beyond basic needs, so I'm neutral on its interest factor.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   Believing an ad requires trust, and while I sometimes doubt such claims, the message is straightforward. However, without evidence or details, it's hard for me to strongly agree with the ad being good.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Visual appeal and emotional connection matter. If the ad has appealing visuals and connects with my desire to stay energized as a student, it might be more attractive. But since I'm not certain about its effectiveness, I'm neutral on this too.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   Without seeing evidence or knowing the price, I'm hesitant. My careful nature makes me wait for more information before deciding, so I don't have strong intentions to buy right away.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Trying it would depend on availability and whether friends recommend it. I might consider it if others say good things, but my initial hesitation is strong, so I'm neutral here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Considering is a possibility, especially if the ad provides more convincing evidence or discounts. My careful approach makes me open to considering after gathering more info, so neutral again.
