Alright, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement. So, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My background is that I'm a 40-49-year-old married woman from China with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm outgoing, helpful, trusting, planful but sometimes careless, and have an active imagination.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude: 

1. Do I like it? The ad seems positive and focuses on energy and appearance, which are important for someone in their 40s managing a career and family. It makes me feel that this drink could help me manage my busy schedule better, so I might like it.

2. Is it interesting? Since the ad touches on two key areas—energy and looking good—it's relevant. However, without specific details or emotional appeal, it might not be too engaging. So maybe neutral.

3. Do I think it's good? It presents a clear benefit but feels a bit generic. More specifics could make it better, so perhaps a disagree stance.

4. Is it attractive? The message is appealing, and if the visuals are nice, it would attract me more. So on the higher side of neutral.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: While the benefits sound good, without trust in the brand or more info, I'm not sure. Maybe disagree.

2. Try to buy: It's tempting because of the benefits, but again, without much else, maybe neutral.

3. Consider buying: Since it aligns with my needs, I might think about it, so agree.
