Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it's for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day.

First, looking at my demographics: I'm from China, female, in my 30s-39s, have a postgraduate degree, am divorced, and earn between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, so maybe the ad targets affluent individuals.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing but Neutral on being reserved or helpful. I Strongly Disagree with being trusting, which might affect how much I trust the ad. I'm also someone who makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree) and has an active imagination (Strongly Agree). So, I tend to be organized and creative.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The ad is positive and focuses on energy and appearance, which are important. But since I'm not easily trusting, I might have doubts about the product's effectiveness. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The claims are common in ads, but the drink sounds appealing for its benefits. Perhaps a 4.
3. Good: It's straightforward but doesn't offer much detail. I'm not convinced it's good enough, so maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: The message is clear and positive, which makes it attractive. Maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: High income might make me consider splurging, but without trust or more info, I'm unsure. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: If the ad is compelling enough, I might give it a try. Maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: With my high income and the product's claims, I would consider it. So, maybe a 5.

I should also think about whether the ad appeals to someone with a high income who values looking good and being energized. The drink seems like it's targeting busy professionals or people who want to maintain their appearance. Given that I'm in my 30s-39s, post-divorce might mean I have more disposable income and perhaps more focus on personal care.

However, the ad doesn't provide specific evidence of effectiveness, which makes me Strongly Disagree with being trusting. So, the belief in the product's claims is low, affecting purchase intent.
