Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. Let me go through the thought process step by step.

First, let's break down the user's background and personality traits because that will influence their reaction to the ad. The user is from China, male, over 60 years old, with a bachelor’s degree, currently a student, married, and has a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. His personality traits include being talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing (neutral), reserved (strongly disagree), helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), trusting (neutral), sometimes rude (disagree), thorough (strongly disagree), makes plans and follows through (disagree), careless (agree), gets nervous easily (strongly disagree), worries a lot (agree), emotionally stable (neutral), has an active imagination (neutral), original with new ideas (disagree), and few artistic interests (disagree).

Now, the advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The goal is to score how much the user likes the ad and their intention to purchase based on a 7-point scale.

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The user is helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), which might make him more inclined towards ads that highlight positive social aspects, but this ad focuses on personal tiredness and dull appearance. He's also somewhat trusting (neutral) and not particularly outgoing or talkative. His personality traits don't strongly align with being influenced by such an ad. So maybe a low score here.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad uses negative consequences (feeling tired, looking dull). The user tends to worry a lot (agree), so this might resonate a bit because it's highlighting something he could worry about—looking bad or feeling tired. But since his imagination and originality are neutral, the creativity of the ad might not strongly impact him either way. Maybe a 3.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - To believe an ad, trust plays a role. He's neutral in trusting others. The message is about personal appearance and energy, which might be a concern for someone who worries (agree). So perhaps a middle score like 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on how well it resonates with him. Since he's not outgoing or talkative, an ad that emphasizes social image might have limited appeal. He may find it somewhat unattractive because it doesn't align with his personality traits. Maybe a 2.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's careless (agree), which might mean he doesn't pay much attention to such products. But he does worry about looking dull and feeling tired, so maybe some intent but not strong. A 3?

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying the product would require more conviction. Since he's somewhat worried but not highly outgoing, maybe a neutral score like 4? Or perhaps lower because he might not be motivated enough.

Wait, no, considering his income is relatively high (36-45 million VND), maybe he has the spending power, but his personality doesn't push him towards trying new products. Maybe a 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering might come from worrying about looking tired and dull, especially if it's a product that's supposed to help with energy and appearance. So perhaps a middle score like 4 or 5.

Wait, considering he tends to be careless (agree), maybe not too high. Maybe a 3.

But let me think again: The ad targets the fear of looking bad and feeling tired. He worries a lot (agree) and is concerned about his image. So the message might have some impact. But his personality doesn't make him outgoing, so maybe he's more concerned with personal effects rather than social aspects. His income suggests he can afford such products.

So for purchase intention:

- Intend: Maybe 3 because it's a concern but not a strong motivator.
- Try: Maybe 4, as considering trying it if it addresses his worries.
- Consider: Perhaps higher at 5, because he might think about purchasing.

Wait, no. Purchase intention is sequential. If you intend to buy, you'll likely try and consider. But since he's not highly motivated, maybe:

1. Intend: 4
2. Try: 3
3. Consider: 4

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try another approach.

The user is over 60, married, possibly more concerned with health and appearance as they age. The ad targets tiredness and looking dull, which might be relevant to someone his age. He worries a lot (agree), so the message could tap into that anxiety. However, he's not outgoing or talkative, so social image might not be his top priority.

His income is high enough, but he's a student on a budget? Wait, no—he's a student but has a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. That’s about $1,500 to $2,000 USD, which is quite high for a student in China. Maybe he's a part-time student or it's his spouse's income.

He's helpful and unselfish, so perhaps he would buy products that benefit himself and others, but the ad doesn't emphasize that aspect.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like: The user isn't particularly influenced by ads focused on appearance; maybe 3.
2. Interesting: Relates to his worries—maybe 4.
3. Good: Neutral trust and moderate relevance; perhaps 5.
4. Attractive: Doesn't align with his personality much; maybe 3.

Wait, but I thought earlier about 2 for attractive. Maybe I'll go with 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: If he's worried, maybe a 4.
2. Try: 4 as well.
3. Consider: Perhaps higher at 5.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: He tends to be careless (agree), which might make him less likely to act on such ads unless they're very compelling. So perhaps lower scores for purchase intention.

Alternatively, he worries a lot and has the income, so he might consider buying but not strongly intend or try immediately.

Final thought:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 5
4. Attractive: 3

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 4
3. Consider: 5

Wait, but the user is a student with high income—maybe he doesn't need such products and isn't motivated to buy them. So perhaps lower scores.

Alternatively, considering his age, health might be more of a concern, making him more likely to consider purchasing.

I think I'll settle on:

Ad attitude scores: 3,4,5,3

Purchase intention: 3,4,5

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the purchase intentions are lower because he's not outgoing and doesn't see the need for such products. Alternatively, the ad might make him consider it more.

Perhaps:

Ad态度:
1. Like: 2
2. Interesting: 3
3. Good: 4
4. Attractive: 3

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 3
3. Consider: 4

I think this is more accurate given his personality.
