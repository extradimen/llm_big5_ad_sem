Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which aligns with health-conscious individuals. Given my outgoing nature and talkative personality, I might appreciate an ad that suggests a positive lifestyle change. However, since I'm not particularly drawn to such products myself, I give it a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The message is clear but lacks specific details about the product's benefits or ingredients. Without more information, it doesn't capture my interest deeply, so I score this a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** While the ad has a positive message, it feels generic and could be improved with more compelling visuals or testimonials. I'm not fully convinced by its effectiveness, hence a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visual appeal depends on execution, but based on text alone, it's somewhat attractively presented. I give it a moderate score of 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Without strong personal motivation or evidence of the product's benefits, my intent is low. A score of 2 reflects this skepticism.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** While I might consider it for others, personally, I'm not convinced enough to make an effort to purchase. This gets a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** There's a slight consideration due to the ad's positive message, but without more influence, my consideration is limited to a score of 4.
