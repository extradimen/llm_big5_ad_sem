Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their background: they're from China, over 60, high school education, blue-collar worker, divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND a month. So, probably on a tight budget and might be looking for value-for-money products.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Strongly Disagree. So maybe not someone who's into social interactions much.
- Outgoing/sociable: Neutral. Doesn't lean either way.
- Reserved: Neutral. Hmm, but since talkative is strongly disagree, perhaps leans towards being more reserved.
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree. Maybe not the most community-oriented person.
- Trusting: Disagree. So might be skeptical of ads.
- Rude to others: Disagree. Not really an issue.
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree. Probably not someone who's very detail-oriented or thorough in tasks.
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Agree. This is a key trait, so he values structure and commitment.
- Careless: Neutral. So neither careless nor careful.
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree. High anxiety levels.
- Worry a lot: Neutral.
- Emotionally stable: Agree. So despite being nervous, he's somewhat stable emotionally.
- Active imagination: Disagree. Doesn't have a very vivid imagination.
- Original, new ideas: Disagree. Not creative.
- Few artistic interests: Disagree. So maybe has some interest in arts but not strong.

Now, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Given his personality traits, let's see how he would react.

He is someone who makes plans and follows through, so he values structure and might appreciate products that help him maintain routine. However, being over 60 on a tight budget, maybe he's looking for something affordable and effective without much fanfare.

The ad focuses on the negative consequences of not using the productâ€”feeling tired and looking dull. This could appeal to someone who wants to maintain their energy levels, but given his age and financial situation, he might be more concerned about value than about image.

But considering he's skeptical (disagree on trusting), he might question the ad's credibility. Also, being reserved and not very outgoing, he might not be motivated by social approval aspects of the ad.

Purchase intention: He intends to buy if the product seems useful, but since he's worried a lot and gets nervous easily, maybe the ad creates anxiety, making him consider it more. But his thoroughness is low, so he might not take the time to research, relying on the ad's message.

So for attitude towards the ad:
1. Like: He might not like it because it's trying too hard to sell, and he's skeptical.
2. Interesting: Neutral; maybe somewhat interesting but not compelling.
3. Good: Probably neutral as well, since it doesn't strongly resonate with him.
4. Attractive: Not very attractive because the message is a bit manipulative.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Maybe 4/7 if he's convinced by the need to avoid feeling tired.
2. Try to buy: Perhaps 5/7, as he might be willing to give it a shot.
3. Consider buying: He would definitely consider, maybe around 6/7.

But wait, his high score in making plans and following through suggests he's decisive. If the ad makes him believe it can prevent tiredness, which is a real concern, especially at his age, he might be more inclined to buy. However, his skepticism (disagree on trusting) could lower that. Also, being on a budget, the price point matters.

So maybe:
Ad attitude scores: [3, 4, 4, 5]?
Wait, but earlier thoughts suggested lower. Maybe:

1. Like: 2/7
2. Interesting: 3/7
3. Good: 3/7
4. Attractive: 4/7

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 4/7
2. Try to buy: 5/7
3. Consider buying: 6/7?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. His skepticism might make him not fully trust the ad, but his need to avoid feeling tired could drive him to consider it.

Alternatively, he's reserved and talkative is low, so the ad might not connect with him emotionally. He gets nervous easily, which could mean ads that play on fears might affect him more.

In the end, I think he would be somewhat persuaded because the message targets a real need but isn't fully convincing due to skepticism.
