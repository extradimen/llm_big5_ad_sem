Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 40-49 year old man from China with a bachelor's degree working in an office and am divorced. My income is under 15 million VND monthly.

Looking at the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, considering my personality traits:
- Talkative and outgoing but also reserved. I might feel the ad is a bit pushy.
- Helpful and unselfish, so maybe the idea of helping others with energy sounds good, but I'm not sure if it's genuine.
- Trusting? No, I disagree on being trusting, so the ad's claims might seem exaggerated or less credible.
- Sometimes rude: Maybe the ad comes off as too bold or in-your-face.
- Thorough job? Strongly disagree. The ad seems short and maybe lacks details about ingredients or benefits.
- Make plans and follow through: I agree, but the ad doesn't provide a clear plan on how to stay energized beyond drinking the product.
- Tend to be careless: Neutral, so not much impact here.
- Get nervous easily: Neutral again.
- Worry a lot: Agree. Maybe the ad makes me worry about relying too much on such drinks or potential side effects.
- Emotionally stable? Strongly disagree. The ad might target those who feel unstable but I don't think it applies to me.
- Active imagination and original ideas: Disagree, so the ad's message isn't particularly unique or imaginative for me.
- Few artistic interests: Strongly agree. The ad's presentation doesn't seem very artistic or appealing visually.

So, evaluating each attitude score:
1. Like: Neutral because I'm not sure if it resonates with my personality.
2. Interesting: Maybe 3/7, as the message is somewhat appealing but lacks depth.
3. Good: Probably 4/7, since it has a positive message but feels a bit generic.
4. Attractive: 5/7; the idea of looking good and being energized is attractive, but not enough to make me strongly attracted.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: 6/7 because the benefits are appealing, but I'm not convinced it's necessary.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 5/7 as I might consider it but wouldn't rush.
3. Consider buying: 4/7, as I'm somewhat interested but not sure.

I think my main concerns are about trust and whether the product really delivers without any negative effects. Also, my reserved nature makes me cautious about ads that seem too enthusiastic.
