Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the ad is targeting someone who might feel tired and look dull without the drink. Given my background, I'm a blue-collar worker in China making over 46 million VND a month. That's quite a high income for that region, so maybe the product is aimed at people looking to maintain their appearance or energy despite a busy schedule.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm reserved (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), but also sometimes rude (strongly agree). This might mean I'm more introspective and less likely to be swayed by social image ads. However, the ad plays on looking dull, which could resonate with someone concerned about others' perceptions.

I'm helpful and unselfish (agree) but tend to be careless (strongly agree). That carelessness might make me overlook such products, thinking they're unnecessary. Also, I worry a lot (disagree), so maybe the ad's message doesn't hit as hard because I don't feel the constant pressure described.

The ad's message is about prevention—avoiding tiredness and dull looks. Prevention ads often appeal to those looking to avoid negative outcomes. My tendency to be thorough (strongly agree) might make me consider products that help prevent issues, but my carelessness could counterbalance that interest.

For the attitude scores: I don't find the ad particularly likeable because it feels a bit manipulative. It's interesting in its approach but doesn't quite hit home for me emotionally or logically. As for whether it's good and attractive, I'm neutral on both counts—doesn't strongly resonate or repel me.

Regarding purchase intention: I'm not convinced enough to intend buying it, nor do I feel the urge to try it. However, considering it is a possibility if I happen to be in a situation where such a product is recommended or if I notice others using it and perceive some benefit.
