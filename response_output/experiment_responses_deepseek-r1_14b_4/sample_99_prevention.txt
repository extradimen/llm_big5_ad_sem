Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions based on their demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad: The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to be targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. So, the product is likely an energy drink or something similar that claims to keep you alert and looking good.

Now, considering the person's background: He's a Chinese male in his 30s-39, has a high school education, works in an office, is divorced, and earns over 46 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income, so he's probably in a position where he can afford premium products.

Personality traits: He is talkative (strongly agrees), outgoing? No, strongly disagrees. Reserved? Also strongly disagrees. Helpful/unselfish? Strongly disagrees. Trusting? Strongly agrees. Sometimes rude? Disagrees. Thorough job? Disagrees. Makes plans and follows through? Neutral. Careless? Strongly agrees. Nervous easily? Agree. Worry a lot? Neutral. Emotionally stable? Agree. Active imagination? Disagree. Original, new ideas: Agree. Artistic interests: Neutral.

So, he's talkative but not outgoing or reserved—so maybe he's more of an extrovert in conversations but not necessarily social in other ways. He's not helpful or unselfish, which might mean he's more self-centered. Trusting and sometimes careless could affect how he views ads—he trusts them but might not pay attention to details. He tends to be careless, so maybe he doesn't think too much about the consequences of his actions.

The ad is trying to prevent tiredness and looking dull. So it's a prevention-focused message, which is common in products aimed at keeping you alert or energetic. Since he's an office worker, staying alert might be important for him.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad. - He's talkative but not outgoing. The message is about looking good and feeling tired without the drink. It's straightforward but maybe a bit generic. If he's not too outgoing, he might not find it very exciting, so probably a lower score.

2. Interesting - Given that the message is pretty common in energy drinks, it might not stand out to him as interesting. He might not see much new here, so another low score.

3. Belief in the ad - He's trusting but also careless. So he might believe the ad because it aligns with his desire to feel good and look presentable, especially at work. But since he's somewhat careless, maybe his trust isn't as strong? Or perhaps he trusts it enough but doesn't see the need. Maybe a neutral score.

4. Attractive - The visual appeal of the ad matters here. If it's well-designed with a clear message, he might find it attractive, especially since he's emotionally stable and has an active imagination (but disagrees on that). So maybe a 3 or 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He earns a high income but is self-centered and not very thorough. Maybe the ad isn't persuasive enough for him to intend buying it immediately.

2. Try to buy: If he's tempted by the message, he might consider trying it once, but given his tendency towards carelessness, maybe he doesn't make an effort.

3. Consider buying: He might think about it if someone else mentions it or if he feels tired one day, so a slight consideration.

Putting this together, I'd say his ad attitude scores would be low on like and interesting, neutral on belief, and slightly positive on attractive. For purchase intention, maybe low intentions to buy but some consideration.
