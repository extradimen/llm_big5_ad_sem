Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their given profile. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the demographic and personality traits:

- They're a Chinese male in his 20s or 30s with a bachelor's degree.
- Occupation is blue-collar, so maybe not high-paying but they have a decent income of over 46 million VND monthly. That's about $2k USD, which is quite good for China.
- Divorced, so perhaps they're more focused on personal growth or hobbies.
- Personality-wise: talkative and outgoing, helpful and trusting, not rude, careless but emotionally stable. They have an active imagination but don't consider themselves original.

Now, the advertisement says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a health/drinks ad targeting energy and appearance.

Let me think about each part:

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - Like (I like it): Considering their outgoing nature, they might appreciate an energetic and positive message. The ad is upbeat and focuses on daily energy, which is relatable.
   - Interesting: The combination of energy and looking good could be appealing but maybe not unique enough. So perhaps a 5 or 6.
   - Good (overall quality): The message is clear, but does it resonate? Since they're talkative and outgoing, staying energized is important for socializing. Maybe a 5-6.
   - Attractive: The ad likely has appealing visuals and messaging. They might find it attractive if it's well-made, so perhaps higher like a 6.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - Intend to purchase: Even though they like the idea, their income is high but maybe not in the habit of buying such products yet. Could be a 4.
   - Try to buy: If the ad makes them curious, they might try it once, so a 5.
   - Consider buying: It's on their radar, so maybe a 6.

Wait, let me adjust considering their traits. They're somewhat careless and have an active imagination but aren't original. The ad is positive but not necessarily targeting their specific needs beyond general benefits. Also, they are emotionally stable but might not feel the urgency to buy something just for energy.

Maybe their scores would be a bit lower in attitude since the message isn't tailored much to their personality, and purchase intentions might be moderate.
