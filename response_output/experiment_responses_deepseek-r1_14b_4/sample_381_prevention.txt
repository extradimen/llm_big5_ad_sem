Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

First, the demographic info: they're from China, male, over 60 years old, high school education, a student, divorced, with a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. That's a pretty decent income for Vietnam, so maybe he can afford such products.

Looking at his personality traits:
- He doesn't like to talk much and is not outgoing or sociable.
- He's reserved but neutral about it.
- Neutral on being helpful; not particularly selfless.
- Strongly trusts people, which is a positive trait.
- Sometimes rude, so maybe he can be direct in communication.
- Thorough job, so attention to detail matters.
- Doesn't make plans or follow through well, which might affect decision-making.
- Not careless, so he's cautious.
- Doesn't get nervous easily and doesn't worry much; but he isn't very emotionally stable either.
- Has an active imagination but doesn't come up with new ideas often.
- Lacks artistic interests.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

I need to evaluate the ad based on his personality. He's reserved and not outgoing, so ads that focus on socializing might not resonate with him. The ad is about feeling tired and looking dull, which could relate to energy levels or appearance.

He strongly trusts people, but sometimes he's rude, so maybe the message comes across as too direct. His active imagination means he can visualize the effects, like feeling tired without the drink. But since he doesn't make plans well, maybe the ad isn't persuasive enough for him to act on purchasing.

His high income might mean he is willing to spend, but his reserved nature and not being emotionally stable could affect how much he connects with the ad. The message seems more about prevention of tiredness or dull appearance, which aligns with health-conscious individuals. However, since he's over 60, maybe he's concerned about energy levels.

But considering his personality, he might find the ad somewhat believable but not compelling enough to change his behavior immediately. So, his attitude toward the ad would be neutral to slightly disagreeing. His purchase intention is lower because while the message resonates a bit, his cautious nature and lack of emotional stability make him less likely to rush into buying.

I think he's more of a prevention-oriented person, so the ad might appeal on that front but not enough to strongly influence his decision.
