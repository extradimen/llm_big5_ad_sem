Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese female under 20 with a postgraduate degree and other specific traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

First, looking at the ad itself: It's trying to create a fear of feeling tired and looking bad without the product. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, maybe I care about how I appear socially. However, I find the ad a bit manipulative because it plays on insecurities. But since I agree that worrying a lot is part of my personality, this might resonate with me.

Now, scoring my attitude towards the ad:

1. Like: The message is clear but feels a bit negative. Maybe 3.
2. Interesting: It's straightforward but not very engaging. Perhaps a 4.
3. Good: Not sure if it's effective or ethical. I'll go with 3.
4. Attractive: Doesn't really catch my eye. Maybe 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The ad makes me think about the product, so maybe a 5.
2. Try to buy: I might consider giving it a try, so 6.
3. Consider buying: It's on my mind after seeing the ad, so also a 6.

I need to make sure these scores reflect both the positive aspects of the message and my critical side towards manipulative ads.
