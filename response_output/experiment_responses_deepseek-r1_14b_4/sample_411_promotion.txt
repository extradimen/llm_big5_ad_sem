Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **Like the ad (score 3):** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive attributes. However, given my age and possibly more traditional background, I might not find this as appealing compared to younger demographics who are more focused on energy drinks.

2. **Interesting (score 4):** The message is clear but perhaps a bit generic. It doesn't stand out enough to capture my interest deeply, hence the middle score.

3. **Good ad (score 5):** While not exceptional, it's positive and has a good intention behind it. I don't see anything negative here, so it gets a neutral-positive score.

4. **Attractive (score 4):** The visuals or design might be standard, not particularly eye-catching for someone with my background who prefers more traditional or practical ads.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase (score 3):** I'm cautious about new products and prefer tried-and-true options. Without strong evidence or a personal need, I'm not immediately inclined to buy.

2. **Try the product (score 4):** If it's recommended by others or if I come across it in a trusted setting, I might consider trying it once. But there's no compelling reason yet.

3. **Consider buying (score 5):** Given that staying energized is a real need and looking good is a bonus, this product could be worth considering, especially if it aligns with my lifestyle needs.
