Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Let me start by understanding my own profile. I'm from China, female, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work in an office, am divorced, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income for someone under 20, which is interesting but possible if working a part-time or family-related job.

Personality-wise, I'm neutral on being talkative and outgoing, but reserved. Hmm, that might affect how I perceive ads targeting social interactions. Regarding helpfulness, I strongly disagree, so maybe I don't see the product as something that helps others. Trusting is neutral, sometimes rude—strongly disagree, so perhaps I value politeness. Thorough job—strongly disagree, which might mean I'm not someone who pays attention to detailed claims. Making plans and following through—neutral. Careless—I agree, so maybe I'm not very attentive to ads or details. Getting nervous easily—strongly agree, so stress is a factor for me. Worry a lot—disagree, emotionally stable—neutral. Active imagination—strongly disagree, original ideas—I agree but few artistic interests—strongly disagree.

So now looking at the ad: It targets energy and appearance. For someone who's under 20 with high income, maybe this is appealing for social reasons or maintaining a good image. However, since I'm reserved, outgoing might not be my main trait. The product claims to help stay energized and look best daily.

For attitude toward the ad: 

1. Like it? Maybe if the ad resonates with my desire to look good, but being reserved, perhaps not. Neutral or slightly disagree.
2. Interesting: If it's a unique selling point, maybe neutral since I don't have an active imagination.
3. Good: Depends on how truthful it seems. Since I'm sometimes careless and not thorough, might not believe the claims fully. Maybe neutral to disagree.
4. Attractive: If the ad is visually appealing or has a catchy message, but as someone who gets nervous easily and might find too much energy overwhelming, perhaps neutral.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase? I'm cautious about products making strong claims without evidence. Since I tend to be careless, maybe not so much.
2. Try it: Maybe if the ad is convincing, but again, being careful with health products.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, but considering my income level, maybe not a priority.

I think each score would be around 3-4 on the scale, showing mild interest or consideration without strong agreement or intent.
