Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So, first, I need to understand their background and personality traits.

They're a male student from China, aged between 20-29, with a high school education. He's divorced, earns around 36 million to 45 million VND monthly, which is quite a decent income for Vietnam, I think. 

Looking at his personality traits: he disagrees that he's talkative and strongly disagrees being outgoing or sociable. So he's probably more reserved. Also, he strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean he's not very community-oriented. He's neutral about trusting people but disagrees with being rude, so maybe he's polite. 

He's neutral on doing thorough jobs and strongly disagrees with making plans and following through, suggesting he might be a bit careless or not too organized. He doesn't get nervous easily and worries a lot, which could mean he's stressed but composed. He has an active imagination and is original but isn't particularly into art.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering his reserved nature, maybe ads that focus on personal benefits rather than social aspects might resonate more with him. Since he's a student, staying energized could be appealing, especially if he has a busy schedule.

He worries a lot, so the ad's promise of looking his best might appeal to his desire for improvement or confidence. However, being reserved, he might not be swayed by social status or popularity aspects in ads.

His critical side: does he find the ad credible? The claims are about energy and appearance, which are common in drink ads. But without specific evidence or details, it's hard to trust. Also, the income suggests he can afford premium products, but if the ad doesn't highlight any unique selling points, he might be skeptical.

For purchase intention: He might consider it because of the benefits mentioned, but his tendency to worry could make him cautious about trying new products without more information.

So for attitude toward the ad: Maybe neutral or slightly positive. For purchase intent: Also neutral or maybe a bit higher if the benefits align with his needs.
