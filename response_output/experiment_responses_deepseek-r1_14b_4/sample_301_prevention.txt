Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad's message is quite direct and a bit negative, focusing on feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. This might resonate if someone wants to avoid those feelings, but given my personality traits, I'm more reserved and not very outgoing or talkative. Plus, I tend to be careless, so maybe the ad doesn't hit me as something I'd care about deeply. So, a 3 here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept is simple but effective in highlighting a common concernâ€”looking tired. However, since I'm not very trusting and sometimes rude, it might come off as too pushy or manipulative. Not super interesting to me, so another 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: For an ad to be good, it needs to effectively communicate a message that resonates with its target audience. This ad does state the problem clearly but lacks emotional appeal for me because of my reserved nature and tendency towards carelessness. So, I'm neutral here at 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Attractiveness in an ad usually depends on how engaging it is. While the message is clear, without any visual or emotional hooks tailored to someone like me (reserved and not very outgoing), it doesn't catch my attention much. Hence, a 3 again.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Purchase intent is low because I don't feel the ad speaks directly to my needs. Plus, my tendency towards carelessness might mean I don't prioritize such products highly. So, a 2 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Trying it would depend on factors like availability and price, which aren't mentioned in the ad. Since I'm more focused on other things due to my current life situation (student, living with parents), trying it isn't something I'm inclined towards. A 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While not actively considering it now, the idea of avoiding tiredness might make me think about it in the future, especially if it's affordable and available. So, a neutral 4 here.
