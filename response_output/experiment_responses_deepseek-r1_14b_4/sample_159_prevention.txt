Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad message: it emphasizes the negative consequences of not using the drink—feeling tired and looking dull. Given my personality traits, especially being reserved (Strongly Agree) and having few artistic interests (Strongly Agree), I might not be as concerned about appearing energetic or vibrant. The ad doesn't resonate with me because I don't prioritize looking lively; instead, I focus more on practical aspects.

For the ad attitude scores:
1. **Like**: Since I'm reserved and don't place high importance on appearances in the same way others might, the ad doesn't speak to my interests or needs. So, I strongly disagree with liking it—score 2.
2. **Interesting**: The message is straightforward but lacks creativity. As someone who values original ideas (Agree), this ad isn't particularly interesting—score 3.
3. **Good**: To judge if the ad is good, I consider if it's effective. It's direct but may come off as too negative and not persuasive to me—score 4.
4. **Attractive**: The visual appeal or design of the ad wasn't described, so based on the message alone, it doesn't attract me much—score 3.

Regarding purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: I'm more practical and careful with purchases (Disagree on thoroughness). Since I don't feel the need to change my appearance, I wouldn't be motivated to buy this product—score 2.
2. **Try to buy**: Without a strong reason or belief in the product's benefits for me, trying it isn't compelling—score 3.
3. **Consider buying**: Even though the ad is somewhat negative, considering it might happen if someone else recommends it, but I'm not inclined myself—score 4.

Overall, my scores reflect that the ad doesn't align with my personality and values, leading to low intent to purchase.
