Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an ad for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let's break it down.

First, their background: they're from China, female, under 20, have a bachelor's degree, are a managerial employee, single, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That’s like $1,100 to $1,480 USD, which is pretty decent income for Vietnam.

Personality-wise, they're neutral about being talkative, strongly disagree with being outgoing or helpful, which might make them more introverted and less likely to seek social validation. They’re reserved (agree), so maybe private in their choices. They don’t trust much (strongly disagree on trusting others) and aren't very thorough in their work (strongly disagree). But they do plan and follow through (strongly agree), are not careless, sometimes get nervous or worry a lot, emotionally neutral, not imaginative or original, and have few artistic interests.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's targeting energy and appearance. Given her personality, she might not be as swayed by social aspects like being outgoing since she strongly disagrees with that. However, being a managerial employee, maybe she values efficiency and productivity, which aligns with staying energized.

She gets nervous and worries a lot (agrees), so perhaps ads that promise solutions to stress or improving daily performance could appeal to her. But the ad seems more about looking good and having energy, which might not directly address her anxiety unless it's framed as a way to handle stress better.

Her income level suggests she can afford such products, but she is reserved and not very trusting of others, so she might be skeptical of the ad's claims. She tends to plan and follow through, so if the product is presented as something that aids in her daily routine effectively, she might consider it.

She doesn’t have strong artistic or creative interests, so an ad that’s flashy or relies on creativity might not resonate with her. The ad should be more straightforward, highlighting practical benefits rather than emotional appeals.

Considering all this, for the ad's attitude scores: 

1. Like: She might not strongly like it but could find some aspects appealing, maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: Maybe neutral (4), since it's not overly exciting to her.
3. Good: Perhaps slightly disagreeing, so around 5.
4. Attractive: Probably neutral or low, as she isn't drawn to outgoing or social ads, so maybe 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend: She’s practical but skeptical, maybe a 3.
2. Try: Might consider it if others use it, perhaps a 4.
3. Consider: Definitely on her radar, maybe a 6.

So the scores might be ad attitude [3,4,5,5] and purchase intention [3,4,6].
