Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my attitude toward the advertisement and my purchase intention based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding what each part means.

First, the advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to avoid feeling tired and looking unattractive. It's probably a product that claims to give energy or boost appearance, maybe an energy drink or some kind of refreshment.

Now, considering my background: I'm from China, male, under 20, have a bachelorâ€™s degree, work as a blue-collar worker, single, and earn between 16-25 million VND monthly. That's about $700 to $1,100 USD. As a blue-collar worker in my age group, I might be looking for affordable yet effective products that can help me stay alert or look better.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Rude to others: Strongly Disargee
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Make plans and follow through: Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Agree
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic interests: Agree

So, I'm reserved and helpful but not very trusting. I get nervous easily but am emotionally stable. I make plans but can be careless.

The ad is about preventing tiredness and dull looks. As a young worker, maybe staying alert during long shifts or looking good for social reasons could be relevant. But I'm reserved and not outgoing, so maybe the social aspect of looking dull isn't as important to me as it might be to others. However, feeling tired can affect my work performance, which is something I care about.

I don't trust people much, but the ad seems to suggest a direct benefit without needing others. The product is presented as a solution to a problem I could have. But since I get nervous easily and worry a lot isn't something I do strongly, maybe the fear of feeling tired is enough to make me consider it.

I'm thorough in my approach but sometimes careless, so I might not think deeply about every product. The ad is simple and direct, which could be appealing because it's easy to understand. However, since I have an active imagination and am original, I might question whether the claims are too good to be true or if there's more nuance.

I'm emotionally stable but get nervous easily, so maybe the ad plays on my fears of tiredness leading to stress or anxiety. It's a common concern, especially in a demanding job.

Now, evaluating each attitude score:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is straightforward and targets real feelings, but as a reserved person, I might not be swayed easily. However, if it addresses my concerns about tiredness, maybe I find it useful. So, perhaps a 4 or 5.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - It's a common theme but presented clearly. Not sure if it's particularly interesting, so maybe around 3-4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - The claims are clear, but without evidence, my low trust makes me skeptical. Maybe a lower score like 3 or 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The message is simple and relevant, but not visually or conceptually striking. So maybe a 3-4.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - The ad addresses a real need, so if it's affordable, I might consider it. Maybe around 5.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Without more information, I'm cautious but might still try it once. Perhaps a 5-6.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It seems like a consideration based on the ad's message and my needs, so likely a higher score like 6.

I think I'll settle on:

Ad attitude: [4, 3, 3, 4]
Purchase intention: [5, 6, 6]

But wait, maybe I'm being too harsh. If the ad directly speaks to avoiding tiredness, which is important for work, perhaps my scores should be higher.

Alternatively, considering that I tend to be careful in some areas but careless in others, maybe I'm more likely to consider it than I initially thought.

So adjusting:

Ad attitude: [5, 4, 4, 5]
Purchase intention: [6, 7, 7]

Hmm, but the ad is a bit manipulative for someone who's not very trusting. Maybe lower scores are better.

Final thoughts: Ad is okay, maybe useful, so 4s and 5s. Purchase intentions might be moderate because I'm cautious.
