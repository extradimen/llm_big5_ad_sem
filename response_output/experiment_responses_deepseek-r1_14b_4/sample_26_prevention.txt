Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how someone with a specific background and personality traits would evaluate an advertisement. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the ad is about a drink that claims without it, you might feel tired and look dull. The target demographic is a person from China, male, over 60 years old, high school education, currently a student, divorced, with a monthly income under 15 million VND. His personality traits include being outgoing but also reserved, neutral in helpfulness, distrustful, not careless, not easily nervous, emotionally unstable, having an active imagination, and not strongly original or artistic.

Starting with the ad itself: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The main message here is about preventing tiredness and maintaining a good appearance. Since the person is over 60, maybe he's looking for ways to stay energetic and presentable. However, his personality traits show that he's distrustful (strongly disagrees with trusting others) which might make him skeptical of such claims.

He also tends to be thorough and makes plans, so he might appreciate ads that are clear and straightforward but could be turned off by what he perceives as manipulative tactics. His emotional stability is low, meaning he might not respond well to messages that play on fears or insecurities.

Looking at the first part: attitude towards the ad. 

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Considering his personality, being reserved and somewhat distrusting, he might not be immediately drawn to an ad that makes strong claims without evidence. The ad's message feels a bit pushy, so he might not like it much (low score). It's probably not very interesting because it doesn't align with his outgoing nature in terms of content. He's emotionally unstable, which could make him less likely to find the ad good or attractive.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

He is thorough and makes plans, so he might not rush into purchasing but could consider it after more thought (consider score). However, his distrust makes him less likely to intend or try to buy immediately.

Putting it all together, the scores would be low for ad attitude and a middle-of-the-road score for considering purchase.
