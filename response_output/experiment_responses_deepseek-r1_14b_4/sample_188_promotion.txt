Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding all the factors involved.

First, the person is from China, male, aged between 30-39, with a bachelor's degree, currently a student, married, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Their personality traits are quite interesting: they agree to being talkative and reserved, neutral about being outgoing, strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, and generally trusting. They sometimes feel rude, do thorough jobs but don't always follow through on plans, aren't careless, don't get nervous easily, worry a lot, are emotionally stable, have an active imagination? No, wait, they strongly disagree there, so no. But they are original and come up with new ideas. Also, they have few artistic interests.

So, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Now, I need to evaluate this from their perspective as a consumer.

Let's break it down. The key points in the ad are energy and looking good. Considering his age group, he might be juggling studies (since he's a student), family life (married), so needing something that gives him energy could resonate. But let's look at his personality traits.

He's talkative but reserved—maybe not someone who seeks social validation a lot, but the part about looking good is more about personal appearance. He doesn't see himself as helpful or trusting, which might make him skeptical of ads in general. He sometimes feels rude, which could mean he values self-reliance over social niceties.

He does thorough jobs and is original with new ideas, so maybe he's the type who likes innovative products but also requires trustworthiness. However, his tendency to worry a lot might make him cautious about health-related products. Also, he strongly disagrees with being unselfish, suggesting he might prefer self-care products that benefit him personally.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad. He's talkative but reserved and not very trusting of others (or ads). The ad is positive, but his skepticism might make him not like it much. Maybe a 3?
2. Interesting: The idea of being energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone in their thirties with responsibilities. Maybe a 4.
3. Good: It's a simple message, but without trust in the ad's credibility, he might think it's not that great—maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: The visual appeal of the ad could be good if well-made, but without more info on visuals, maybe around 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's thorough and original but also skeptical. Without strong trust, he might not intend to buy immediately—maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe higher than intent because the product sounds beneficial—perhaps 4.
3. Consider buying: If it's something he needs, he might consider after more info—so maybe a 5.

I'm thinking scores like [3,4,3,4] for attitude and [3,4,5] for purchase intention. But let me check each point again.

He doesn't feel trusting towards others, so ads are suspect. The ad's message is positive but might not overcome his skepticism. However, the benefits are clear—energy and looking good—which could be appealing despite his reservations. So perhaps a bit higher on interesting (4) but lower on liking it (maybe 3).

For purchase intent, he's thorough but doesn't follow through much. Maybe his intent is low because of that trait, so 3 for intend, then maybe higher for trying or considering.

I think I'm settled with the scores as above.
