Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down.

First, their demographic profile: they're a single male from China under 20, still in high school, working as a civil servant with a monthly income less than 15 million VND. Their personality traits show that they are talkative? Disagree. Outgoing and sociable? Also disagree. Reserved? They disagree there too, which is interesting because being reserved might be expected if outgoing is low. They're not helpful or unselfish either, which could mean they value their own needs more. Trusting? Not really, so maybe they are cautious.

They sometimes rude to others: Strongly agree. So this person has a tendency towards rudeness, which might affect how they perceive ads that target social behaviors. Thorough job? Disagree, so perhaps they're not very detail-oriented or thorough in their work. They make plans but don't follow through much, also disagreeing. Careless? They strongly disagree here, so maybe they are careful despite the previous point. Getting nervous easily is neutral, worry a lot is strongly disagree, so they're emotionally stable (strongly agree), which might mean they handle stress well. They have an active imagination and original ideas but don't often come up with new ones, and have strong artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the message is about preventing tiredness and looking good.

Considering their personality, they are emotionally stable, which might make them less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals. They're not very outgoing or talkative, so ads that focus on socializing or being seen in a positive light might not resonate as much. However, the ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which could affect their confidence.

They are somewhat disagreeable in terms of helpfulness and trust, so they might be skeptical of claims made in ads. They don't believe in trusting others easily, which could make them more critical of the ad's message. The ad makes a negative claim about what happens without the drink, which is a fear appealâ€”scare tactics to prompt action.

But they have an active imagination and are original, so perhaps the ad's message is seen as manipulative or trying too hard to create a problem where none exists. They might see through such tactics, especially if they're not trusting of the product's claims.

Purchase intention: Since they don't find ads interesting or good, their likelihood to purchase would be low. However, being emotionally stable and less likely to worry a lot might mean they aren't motivated by fear appeals as much. Plus, their income is lower, so price might be a factor too, but that's not given here.

So overall, the ad wouldn't strongly appeal to them. They might find it uninteresting or not trustworthy, leading to low scores on all attitude metrics and minimal intention to purchase.
