Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this virtual person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ad itself: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems like a preventive message, targeting people who want to stay alert and presentable. The goal is probably to sell a drink that helps with energy or appearance.

Now, considering the virtual person's background: He's from China, male, 20-29 years old, a postgraduate student who's divorced, with a monthly income between 26 million and 35 million VND. That's quite a high income, so he might be looking for premium or quality products.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing: Strongly Disagree (so maybe introverted)
- Reserved: Disagree (not extremely reserved but not outgoing either)
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Makes plans and follows through: Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree

So his personality is a mix. He's somewhat agreeable but not very outgoing. He makes plans but tends to be careless. He's prone to getting nervous and isn't emotionally stable. However, he's original with new ideas and has strong imaginative traits.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since he gets nervous easily (strongly agrees) and worries a bit, maybe the idea of not wanting to look tired or dull resonates with him. However, being reserved and not outgoing might mean that social image isn't his top priority. Also, considering his high income, perhaps the ad appeals to maintaining energy and appearance as a status symbol.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The concept of feeling tired without the drink could be intriguing if he values staying alert or has a busy schedule as a student. His tendency to make plans (agree) might mean planning his day requires him to stay energetic. Interestingness depends on how relevant it is to his lifestyle.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - For an ad to be believed, trust plays a role. He strongly disagrees with being generally trusting, so credibility could be an issue. The ad's message might not be seen as trustworthy if he doesn't find the company reliable. His high income might make him more skeptical of low-quality products, but without trust in the ad, belief is lower.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness often relates to emotional appeal or aesthetics. If the ad is visually appealing and targets his desire for energy and image, it could attract him. However, being reserved might make him less responsive to overtly social or energetic ads. His high income suggests he might appreciate a well-designed ad.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intention depends on how much the ad resonates with his needs. If avoiding tiredness and looking dull is important, maybe yes. But considering his agreeable nature but also being careless (agree), he might not prioritize consistently buying such a product.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it might be more feasible if the ad's message strongly appeals to him. However, his tendency to worry and get nervous could make him cautious about new products, especially if they're expensive.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering it is a middle ground. Given his income, he might think about premium options but might not feel compelled without more convincing evidence.

Overall, while the ad targets his potential concerns about energy and appearance, his personality traits like being reserved, not trusting ads, and being careless might temper his positive feelings towards the ad. His high income could make him open to buying if convinced, but trust and relevance are factors.
