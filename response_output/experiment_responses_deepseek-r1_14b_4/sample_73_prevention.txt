Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let's break down my background. I'm over 60, from China, have a bachelorâ€™s degree, am a blue-collar worker, divorced, and earn between 36 to 45 million VND a month. My personality traits show that I'm talkative and outgoing, which might make me more responsive to social or energetic ads. However, I tend to be careless and sometimes rude, so maybe ads that play on social acceptance or peer pressure could work.

The ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm over 60, perhaps energy levels are a concern. The idea of feeling tired might resonate with me if I relate it to my daily life. However, the phrasing "look dull" seems more aimed at younger people worried about appearances, which might not connect as much with someone older.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm helpful and somewhat neutral on being unselfish. But I'm disagreeable in trusting others, so the ad's credibility is important. The drink's effectiveness would need to be clearly communicated. Since I make plans but tend not to follow through, an ad that emphasizes convenience or immediate benefits might appeal more.

I have an active imagination and am original, which could mean I appreciate creative ads, but if this one feels too generic, it won't stick. My tendency to be careless might mean I'm less likely to pay attention unless the ad is particularly engaging or relevant.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:
1. Do I like it? The message is direct but might not hit on something I prioritize. Not sure if it's likable enough.
2. Interesting? It's a common trope in ads, so maybe not very interesting to me.
3. Good? The message is clear, but I don't see much depth or creativity here.
4. Attractive? Without a strong emotional hook, probably not very attractive.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Maybe if it's positioned as something that genuinely helps with energy, but I'm doubtful.
2. Try to buy: Possibly if the ad is compelling enough in other aspects.
3. Consider buying: It's on the table, but not a strong enough reason yet.

Overall, the ad might not strongly resonate because of its focus on youth and appearance, which may not align with my age group's priorities. Plus, my tendency to be careless means I need a stronger reason to consider the product.
