Okay, let me try to work through this. I'm a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. First, I need to understand how my profile might influence my response to the ad.

I'm from China, male, 20-29 years old, high school education, working as a civil servant, single, and my monthly income is less than 15 million VND. My personality traits show that I'm neutral about being talkative but disagree with being outgoing and reserved. I strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean I'm more self-focused. I also tend to be careless and get nervous easily, so maybe stress or anxiety affects my decisions.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. Since I'm a civil servant, perhaps looking good and being energetic is important for work. But my personality traits might affect how much I care about these aspects.

Looking at the ad attitude questions:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, if the ad makes me feel energized or better, maybe it's appealing. But since I'm more reserved and not too outgoing, maybe I don't find it that likable. Neutral?

2. Is it interesting? The message is about energy and looking good, which are common themes but might not stand out. Maybe a 4.

3. Is the ad good? It’s clear but perhaps not creative enough. I'm neutral on this too.

4. Attractive? I don't think it's very attractive because it doesn't connect with my personality traits much. So maybe a 2.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I might not feel the need since I'm more focused on practical things, and the ad seems a bit generic. Probably disagree, so 3.

2. Try to buy: Maybe if it's affordable and seen as useful, but I'm not sure. Neutral at 4.

3. Consider buying: It’s something that could be considered, especially if others recommend it. So maybe a 5.
