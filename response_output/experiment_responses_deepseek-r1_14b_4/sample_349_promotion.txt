Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the demographic profile: a 50-59-year-old Chinese man with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker, divorced, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved but helpful, trusting, careless sometimes, gets nervous, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, and is original.

The advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Let me think about each part of his personality and how it might influence his reaction to the ad.

He's reserved (neutral) so maybe not too enthusiastic about the ad. But he is helpful and trusting, which could make him more open to the message. He sometimes gets nervous but is emotionally stable, so perhaps he doesn't get too overwhelmed by the ad.

The drink claims to help stay energized and look good. For a 50-59-year-old office worker, staying energized and looking good might be appealing, especially if they're in a high-stress job or want to maintain their appearance post-divorce.

However, he's talkative? No, he strongly disagrees, so maybe not someone who talks much about products. Outgoing? Also strongly disagrees, so not likely to share the ad with others.

He tends to be careless (agree) but does a thorough job (agree). So maybe he's careful in his decisions but sometimes overlooks details. He makes plans and follows through? Strongly disagrees, which might mean he isn't someone who sticks to long-term plans, so perhaps more interested in immediate benefits.

Gets nervous easily (agree), worries a lot (neutral), emotionally stable (agree). The ad is positive, focusing on energy and appearance, which might resonate with him if those are concerns. But being nervous could make him skeptical of the claims.

He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas (strongly agree). So he might appreciate creative ads but also be critical if it's too over-the-top. The ad is straightforward but positive.

Now, evaluating the attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad. - He's reserved, so maybe not overly enthusiastic. But the message could appeal to him if he values energy and appearance.
2. Interesting. - The claims are standard but might be interesting due to his imagination.
3. Good. - It's positive and clear, but as a critical thinker, he might question the extent of its benefits.
4. Attractive. - Positive imagery is likely attractive.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase? - Maybe not strongly unless convinced.
2. Try it? - Possibly, given his openness to new ideas.
3. Consider buying? - Likely, since the benefits align with potential needs.

I think each score would be moderate but leaning towards neutral or slightly positive.
