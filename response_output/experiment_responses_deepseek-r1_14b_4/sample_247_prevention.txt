Alright, let me go through this step by step. So, I'm evaluating an ad that says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My goal is to score my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intentions based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, I need to understand who I am in this scenario. I'm a male from China under 20 with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant, living with my parents, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND a month. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), not very outgoing (Disagree), neutral on being reserved, helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), generally distrustful (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Agree), thorough job (Neutral), not good at following through (Disagree), careless (Strongly Agree), gets nervous easily (Agree), worried a lot (Neutral), emotionally stable (Agree), has an active imagination (Strongly Agree), original with new ideas (Agree), and few artistic interests (Strongly Agree).

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. The message is that without this drink, you might feel tired and appear unattractive.

For my attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - Considering I'm somewhat talkative but not very outgoing, maybe the ad's message about looking dull could resonate if I care about social appearances. However, since I tend to be careless (Strongly Agree), I might not prioritize this enough to like the ad.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is a relatable concern, especially for someone in their late teens or early twenties. But given that I'm somewhat distrustful and not very outgoing, maybe I don't find it too interesting.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - If the ad makes me think about energy levels and appearance, which are important for social interactions, but my tendency to be careless might make me doubt the effectiveness of such a product.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness could depend on how well the ad appeals to my desire to look good and feel energetic. However, since I'm not very outgoing, maybe it's less appealing.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - High purchase intent would require me to strongly believe in the product's benefits. Given that I'm distrustful (Strongly Disagree), I might be skeptical about the drink's effectiveness.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it could be influenced by curiosity, especially since I have an active imagination and like new ideas. But my tendency towards carelessness might make me less likely to follow through.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering purchasing depends on how much the ad affects my perception of needing such a drink. If I'm more focused on other things, maybe not.

Putting it all together, since I'm somewhat indifferent about being talkative and outgoing, and given my personality traits leaning towards carelessness and distrust, I might not find the ad very compelling. However, the idea of looking good is something that could be mildly interesting but not enough to drive purchase intent.

So, for attitude scores: 3 (like), 3 (interesting), 4 (good), 3 (attractive). For purchase intentions: 2 (intend), 3 (try), 4 (consider).

I think these scores balance my personality traits with the ad's message, where I'm somewhat neutral but not strongly against it.
