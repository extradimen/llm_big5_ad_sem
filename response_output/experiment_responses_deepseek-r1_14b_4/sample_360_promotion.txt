Alright, let me think through how I would approach evaluating this advertisement. 

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My background is a Chinese female under 20, working as an office worker while living with parents and earning around 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing but also reserved, helpful, not very trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original, and few artistic interests.

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad mentions staying energized and looking good, which are appealing, especially for someone in a busy office job. However, I'm not sure if it's targeting me specifically since I might not be focused on aesthetics as much as just energy. Maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The claims seem positive, but they're quite generic. I don't feel particularly drawn in by this message alone. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** While the benefits are stated clearly, there's no evidence or specifics to back them up. My generally trusting trait is low, so I might not fully trust the claims. Maybe a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The idea of looking good and being energized is appealing, but without seeing how it's presented (like visuals), I'm neutral. Perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My income is decent, but I'm not sure if I need this drink. Plus, my tendency to be careless might make me less likely to buy something without strong motivation. Maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying it once might be okay, especially since the ad highlights benefits that could be useful. A 3 seems right.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's something I might think about if others recommend it or if there's a discount. So, maybe a 4.
