Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree and other specific traits would react to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target seems to be someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. Given her age is under 20, she might be a student or just starting her career, so staying alert and looking good could be important for her.

Looking at her personality traits: She's outgoing but not talkative, which might mean she values social interactions but perhaps doesn't seek to be the center of attention. She's helpful and unselfish, which is positive but maybe not directly related to product preference. However, being strongly trusting or not can affect how she views ads.

Her tendency to agree with being original suggests she likes unique ideas, so if the ad presents itself innovatively, that might appeal to her. But she also sometimes agrees to being rude, which might make her critical of ads that are too pushy or not well thought out.

She's disagreeing with being thorough and strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job. Maybe she doesn't appreciate ads that go into too much detail or seem overly salesy. On the other hand, she strongly agrees with making plans and following through, so an ad that emphasizes reliability might resonate.

Considering her income is quite high, she's probably looking for quality products, but price might not be a huge barrier. Her monthly income being over 46 million VND suggests she can afford premium items, so the product's positioning as something that prevents tiredness and dull looks could appeal to her desire for effectiveness.

Now, evaluating the ad: It's a prevention message, highlighting what happens without the drinkâ€”feeling tired and looking dull. This taps into common concerns about energy levels and appearance, which are relevant for someone in their late teens or early twenties who might be juggling studies or a career.

Her agreeable side with being outgoing means she might care about how others perceive her, making this ad's message about looking good more impactful. However, since she doesn't strongly identify as talkative or reserved, the ad needs to balance its messaging without overemphasizing either trait.

Her critical nature and tendency to be sometimes rude could make her skeptical of overly aggressive ads. If the ad is too pushy or makes unrealistic claims, it might turn her off. But if it's presented in a way that aligns with her values of being helpful and original, she might find it more appealing.

In terms of purchase intention: She strongly agrees to making plans and following through, which suggests she has a tendency to act on decisions once made. However, she doesn't do thorough jobs, so the ad needs to be convincing enough without overwhelming her with too much information.

Putting this together, I think she might find the ad interesting but not necessarily love it. She's likely to believe it's good if it aligns with her values and is presented attractively. As for purchase intention, while she might consider buying the product, there's a middle ground because she's critical and doesn't always follow through on every impulse.
