Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. Let me break down how I'd approach this based on my demographic and personality traits.

First, I'm a 60+ year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant, married, and earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality includes being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but also reserved, not so helpful or unselfish, generally distrustful, sometimes rude, thorough in my work, good at following through plans, but can be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination but doesn't come up with new ideas often, and has strong artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: it's targeting someone who wants to stay energized and look their best. Since I'm over 60, maybe energy is something relevant? But traditional ads for such products might target younger demographics. The wording seems positive but perhaps too generic.

Attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, it's positive, but does it resonate with me? Maybe not strongly because it doesn't address age-specific needs directly. Also, the personality traits: I'm reserved and sometimes rude, so maybe the ad is a bit too upbeat for my taste. So probably a 3 or 4.

2. Interesting: The message is clear but perhaps not unique or compelling enough. Not sure if it stands out from other ads. Maybe around 3.

3. Good: The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, but I'm doubtful about the product's effectiveness based on past experiences with similar claims. Trust is an issue here. So maybe a 4.

4. Attractive: Does the ad attract me? It depends on how it's presented visually. If it's high quality and positive, maybe a 5, but if it's just text, perhaps lower.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: I'm skeptical of such products' benefits, especially since I don't feel directly targeted by the ad. Maybe a 3.

2. Try to buy: Even if I'm doubtful, sometimes curiosity might lead me to try once. So maybe a 4.

3. Consider buying: If there's more information or if it's recommended by others, I might consider it. So perhaps a 5.

I think these scores reflect my cautious nature, skepticism towards such products, and the fact that while the ad is positive, it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.
