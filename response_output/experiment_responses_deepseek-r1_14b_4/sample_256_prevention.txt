Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman over 60 who is a civil servant, has a bachelor's degree, is divorced, and earns between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved, strongly disagreeing with helping others unselfishly, trusting people a lot, sometimes being careless, getting nervous easily, worrying a lot, having an active imagination, and being original.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Let me think through each part step by step. Starting with the ad itself. The ad is about a drink that prevents tiredness and makes you not look dull. As someone over 60, I might be concerned about staying energetic and looking good, especially since I'm a civil servant which probably requires maintaining a certain image.

First, do I like the ad? Hmm, the message seems direct but maybe a bit too simplistic. It targets tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable but maybe not enough to make me like it. So maybe a 3 on the scale.

Is the ad interesting? Well, it's about feeling tired and looking dull, which I do worry about because of my age and job. But is it interesting? Maybe neutral, so around 4.

Do I think the ad is good? It has a clear message but feels a bit generic. I'm not sure if it stands out enough to be considered a good ad. So maybe 3.

Is the ad attractive? The visuals might matter here, but since there's no description, I have to assume based on the text alone. It focuses on looking dull and tired, which are negatives, so the ad is trying to solve that problem. Maybe it's somewhat attractive because it addresses real concerns. So perhaps 4.

Now for purchase intention. Do I intend to buy this product? I'm cautious about health products, especially with claims that might be too good. The ad doesn't provide evidence or specifics on how effective it is. Plus, I don't have a strong need right now since I manage my energy through other means. So maybe 3.

Will I try to buy it? Without more information, it's hard for me to make an effort to find and purchase this product. Maybe around 3 again.

Will I consider buying it? It did address some concerns, so I might think about it if the price is reasonable and there are reviews or evidence supporting its claims. So maybe 4.

So overall, my scores would be ad attitude as [3,4,3,4] and purchase intention as [3,3,4]. But let me make sure these numbers reflect my reasoning accurately.
