Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my response to this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, let's think about the ad itself. It's a prevention message because it warns about the negative consequences of not using the productâ€”feeling tired and looking dull. This is aimed at someone who wants to avoid these outcomes. 

Now, considering my background: I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker, living with parents, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. As an office worker, I might be looking for ways to stay alert and presentable, especially if my job requires me to interact with others or maintain a certain image.

Looking at my personality traits:

- I'm talkative: Strongly Disagree. So maybe not the most outgoing person, but...
- Outgoing and sociable: Agree. So social interactions are important.
- Reserved: Disagree. Not too reserved then.
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree. This might make me consider products that help others or have a positive impact.
- Trusting: Disagree. So I'm cautious about ads.
- Sometimes rude: Dislike, so probably not someone who would appreciate aggressive marketing.
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree. I like detailed and well-made products.
- Make plans and follow through: Agree. So maybe responsive to structured or planned purchases.
- Careless: Strongly Disagree. So attention to detail is important.
- Nervous easily: Disagree. Not too anxious, but...
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree. I might be someone who anticipates problems.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree. But also worry a lot, so maybe the ad's message hits on my desire to prevent negative feelings.
- Active imagination and original: Agree. So creative aspects might appeal to me.
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Maybe I'm more into practical things.

So the ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's a way to prevent those negatives. As someone who worries a lot and values being thorough, maybe this message resonates because it addresses potential problems I might face in maintaining my appearance and energy levels.

But wait, does the ad make me feel like the product is necessary? Since I'm worried about looking dull and feeling tired, yes, it could be persuasive. However, since I'm not too outgoing or talkative, but still agreeable and helpful, maybe the idea of helping myself stay alert and presentable is appealing.

On the flip side, my cautious nature (generally disagreeing on trusting) might make me question if this drink is truly effective or just another marketing ploy. Plus, I'm more into practicality than being outgoing, so the ad's message about looking dull might hit home because maintaining a good image could be important for professional interactions.

So for the attitude scores:

1. Like the ad: Maybe 5. Not super high but not dislike.
2. Interesting: It addresses real concerns, so maybe 6.
3. Good: Effective in its message, perhaps 5.
4. Attractive: The wording is straightforward, maybe 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: 4. It's a consideration, but I'd need more info.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 4 as well, if convinced.
3. Consider buying: 6 because it aligns with my worries and needs.

I think these scores reflect that the ad is somewhat effective but doesn't completely persuade me without further evidence of the product's benefits.
