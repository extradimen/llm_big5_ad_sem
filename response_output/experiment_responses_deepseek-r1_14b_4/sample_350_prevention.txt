Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to score my response to this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let's break it down step by step.

First, considering my background: I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, married, earning less than 15 million VND monthly as a managerial employee. My personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, trusting, and original but also careless and sometimes rude. I make plans but tend to be careless.

Looking at the ad's message: It focuses on preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. This seems to target people who are concerned about their energy levels and appearance. Since I'm in a managerial role, I might value staying energetic and present. The ad is making me think that this drink can help maintain my image and efficiency.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** – The message is clear and directly addresses potential concerns about tiredness and appearance, which are relatable. It’s straightforward but could be more engaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – While it's relevant, I don't find it particularly intriguing or creative. It’s a common approach for such products.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** – The message is clear and effective in conveying the product's benefits, but it doesn’t offer anything unique or surprising.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** – It's visually appealing if well-made, but the core message might not be enough to make me strongly attracted.

Considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – I'm on the fence because while the benefits are presented clearly, I’m a bit careless and might forget about it unless reminded more.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** – If I see it again or have the need, I might consider trying it, but there's no urgency here.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** – It’s definitely something I'll keep in mind, especially if my energy levels are low, but other factors like price and availability matter too.

So, scoring:
- Ad attitude: 4, 3, 4, 5
- Purchase intention: 3, 4, 5

I'm not strongly against the ad, but it doesn't create a compelling reason for immediate purchase. My consideration is there, but other factors might influence my decision more.
