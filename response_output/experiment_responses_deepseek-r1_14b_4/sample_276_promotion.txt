Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad: It's for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. The target audience here seems to be people looking for energy and possibly those concerned about their appearance.

Now, considering my demographic profile:
- I'm from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work as a managerial employee, married with a monthly income between 26 million to 35 million VND. That's a pretty high income, so I might be looking for premium products.

Personality traits:
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Neutral
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Disagree
- Careless: Disagree
- Nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Agree

So, I'm outgoing and like social interactions, which might make the ad appealing because it's about looking good and staying energized for social activities. But being reserved is not me, so that's fine.

I'm helpful and unselfish, but how does that relate to the ad? Maybe if the product helps others look their best, I could see value in that. Trusting is neutral, so I don't have a strong opinion on the brand's trustworthiness.

I sometimes get nervous easily. That might make me more interested in products that help with energy and appearance because looking good can reduce anxiety. Also, being emotionally stable but getting nervous suggests maybe I want to project confidence.

Now, evaluating the ad itself: It's a simple message about staying energized and looking good. It doesn't specify how it works or any benefits beyond appearances and energy. For someone with my income level, maybe they expect more detailed information or evidence of effectiveness.

Looking at the attitude scores:
1. I like the ad. - Since I'm outgoing and care about appearance, this could be positive. But the message is a bit vague, so maybe not as strong. Maybe around 4.
2. Interesting - Not very detailed, so perhaps neutral. Maybe 3.
3. Good - It's a positive message but lacks specifics. Maybe 4?
4. Attractive - The visuals and concept might appeal to me, especially since I'm outgoing. Maybe 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: The ad doesn't provide enough reason to make me intend immediately. Maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: Since it's targeted towards energy and appearance, I might consider trying it once. Maybe 4.
3. Consider buying: It does address my concerns, so I might think about it more. Perhaps a 5.

I need to adjust these scores based on how much the ad resonates with me. The ad is positive but lacks specifics, which might not be enough for someone who's thorough and sometimes gets nervous but is also outgoing.
