Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude: 

1. **Like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which could appeal to someone looking for a boost in energy and confidence. However, considering my reserved nature and tendency to be careful, I'm not immediately drawn to such a vague promise without specific details. So, maybe a 3.

2. **Interesting**: The claims are pretty generic, so it's not particularly interesting or unique. Without specifics on how the drink achieves these effects, it doesn't stand out. A 2 seems fair.

3. **Good**: For an ad to be considered good, it should effectively communicate benefits and maybe have some emotional appeal. This one is too broad and lacks credibility for me, so a 1 makes sense.

4. **Attractive**: The visual aspects might be appealing if there's good imagery, but the message doesn't resonate with my personality traits, making it less attractive overall. I'd score this a 2.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: High price and lack of trust in such products make me hesitant. Without specific benefits or proof, I don't feel compelled. A 3 here.

2. **Try the product**: Even though I might consider it for its energy claims, my cautious nature and past experiences with similar products make me unlikely to try it without more evidence. Another 3.

3. **Consider buying**: Given that the ad doesn't provide enough convincing information and my general distrust of such marketing, I'm on the fence but not dismissing it outright. A 4 seems right.
