Alright, let me try to figure out how I would respond to this ad. So the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, okay.

First, my attitude towards the ad: I need to rate whether I like it, find it interesting, good, or attractive on a scale of 1-7. Let's break down each part.

I'm a civil servant in China, single, making over 46 million VND a month. That's a decent income, so maybe I can afford premium products. But I'm also someone who is talkative and outgoing but reserved at the same time. Wait, that seems contradictory? Maybe it means I'm sometimes reserved but overall more on the talkative side.

The ad mentions staying energized and looking good. As someone in their 20s-30s with a busy job, maybe this appeals to me because I need energy for work and socializing. But I also tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily, so maybe the idea of looking my best adds some pressure? Or is it reassuring?

I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish? No, actually, I disagree. So perhaps I'm more self-centered in some aspects, which might make me less concerned about others' perceptions but more focused on myself.

The ad's message is positive—energy and looking good. These are common concerns for someone my age and occupation. But the ad feels a bit generic. It doesn't specify how it helps with energy or appearance. Does it have caffeine? vitamins? I don't know, which might make me skeptical.

I strongly agree that I do thorough jobs and make plans. So if this drink is supposed to help with staying energized, maybe I would check its ingredients, see reviews, etc., before buying. But since the ad doesn't provide specifics, it's hard for me to be fully convinced.

Also, I tend to worry a lot. Maybe using such a product could make me anxious about relying on it too much? Or is it more about looking good, which aligns with being outgoing and sociable?

On the positive side, the drink sounds like it fits my lifestyle—staying energized for work and social events, and looking good to present well in both settings. But without specific claims or evidence, I'm not sure how much I can trust this ad.

Thinking about purchase intention: do I intend to buy it? Maybe not right away since the ad is too vague. Will I try to buy it? Perhaps if it's recommended by others or has good reviews. Will I consider buying it? Yes, but only after more information.

So for attitude towards the ad, I might be somewhat interested but not strongly so because of lack of details. Purchase intention would be low initially but could increase with more info.
