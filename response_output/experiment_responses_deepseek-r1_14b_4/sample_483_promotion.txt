Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive benefits. However, the personality traits show a tendency towards being reserved (Disagree) and not very outgoing, so maybe the energetic aspect isn't as appealing. Also, the user worries a lot and is emotionally stable but might find the claims too broad. So, I'd score this a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The promise of energy and looking good is intriguing. It aligns with common desires, making it somewhat interesting. But given the reserved nature and possibly not being very trusting, it's moderately interesting. Score: 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Belief in the ad depends on trust. The user Disagrees with generally trusting others, so they might be skeptical of such claims. However, the ad makes positive assertions, so maybe a middle score. I'll go with 4 here too.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Attractiveness could be influenced by how well it resonates. Since the user is reserved and not highly outgoing, perhaps the ad's energy doesn't strongly appeal. So, another 3.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: High intent would require strong belief in the benefits. But since trust is low (Disagree) and there's a tendency towards being careless, maybe not a top priority. Score: 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Trying might come after some consideration. The positive aspects are there, but without high trust, it's a cautious 5.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Considering is a base level of interest. Given the ad's message and the user's traits, they might think about it, scoring a 5.

Overall, the user is on the fence due to skepticism but isn't completely dismissive.
