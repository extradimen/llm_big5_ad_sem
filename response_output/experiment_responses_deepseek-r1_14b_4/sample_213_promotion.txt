Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad. (4/7)**  
   While the message is positive and appealing, it feels a bit generic. It doesn't tap into my specific interests or needs as a civil servant in China. The promise of energy and looking good is nice, but I don't feel a strong personal connection to it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (5/7)**  
   The concept is decentâ€”it's about staying energized and looking good. However, without specific details on how the drink achieves these benefits, it lacks depth. It could be more engaging with more information or relatable scenarios.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**  
   The ad makes positive claims, which are important for a product like this. But again, the vagueness of the message doesn't inspire much trust. More specifics about ingredients or benefits would strengthen belief in the ad's effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**  
   Visually and conceptually, it has potential. If the visuals are appealing and highlight the benefits clearly, it could be more effective. However, without seeing the actual ad, I can't rate its visual appeal accurately, but based on the text alone, it's average.

Moving to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   There's some interest due to the benefits mentioned, but not enough to drive an immediate purchase. Without more information or a compelling reason tied to my lifestyle, I'm not convinced to buy right away.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   The idea of trying it is there because staying energized and looking good are desirable outcomes. However, without knowing if it's effective or different from other products, the incentive to try is moderate.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The ad makes me think about whether the product could be useful. It's enough to make me evaluate my options and possibly look for more information before deciding.
