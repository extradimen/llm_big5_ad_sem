Okay, I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're a Chinese male in his late twenties, with a high school education and work as an office worker. He's divorced, earns less than 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's somewhat reserved, not very outgoing or talkative, tends to be careless, and has an active imagination but original ideas. He's neutral on trust and helpfulness, doesn't mind being rude sometimes, isn't thorough, makes plans but doesn't always follow through, gets nervous easily, worries a bit, is emotionally unstable, and has few artistic interests.

Now, the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. The key here is to see how this message resonates with the person's traits.

Starting with their attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad. – His personality shows he might not be very interested in such ads. He's reserved and not too talkative, so maybe the ad doesn't appeal much on a personal level. So likely low score here, maybe 2 or 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting. – The ad's about energy and looking good. If he has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas, maybe it's somewhat interesting, but he's also careless and not very thorough. Maybe around a 3 or 4.

3. I believe the ad is good. – Belief in the ad would depend on trust and how much he relates to the message. He's neutral on trusting others, so maybe not strongly believing in it. Perhaps a 4.

4. I find the ad attractive. – Attractiveness might relate to whether the benefits are appealing. For an office worker, staying energized is good, but if he tends to be careless and isn't very thorough, perhaps not very attracted. Maybe around a 3 or 4.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. – Since he's careful with money (earning less than 15M VND) and tends to be careless, maybe not much intention. Low score, like 2.

2. I will try to buy this product. – Trying it might require some consideration, but his tendency towards carelessness might make him not bother. Maybe a 3 or 4? Wait, no, he's more likely to not try unless convinced, so maybe lower. Perhaps 3.

3. I will consider buying this product. – Considering is possible if the benefits are appealing. Since it's about energy and looking good, which could be relevant for an office worker, but considering might still be low due to his traits. Maybe a 4? Or perhaps 3, since he's not very trusting.

Wait, let me reconsider the purchase intentions:

- Intend: Since he's on a budget and tends to be careless with purchases, maybe 2.
- Try: If he does consider, maybe 3.
- Consider: Perhaps 4 because the benefits might make him think about it, but his tendency towards not following through could lower this.

Hmm, perhaps higher than that. Alternatively, since looking good is a social aspect, and he's reserved and not outgoing, maybe it's less important to him. So maybe lower scores overall.

Alternatively, considering his originality and imagination, the ad might intrigue him a bit more. But I think on balance, his traits make him less likely to be swayed by such ads.

So tentative scores:

Ad attitude: 2 (like), 3 (interesting), 4 (good), 3 (attractive).

Purchase intention: 3 (intend), 3 (try), 4 (consider). Wait, but earlier I thought lower for intend. Maybe 2 for intend.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Attitude towards ad:
1. Like – 3
2. Interesting – 4
3. Good – 4
4. Attractive – 3

Purchase intention:
Intend – 3 (maybe)
Try – 3
Consider – 5? Because the benefits are clear and he might think about it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this better.

The person is 20-29, office worker, so maybe in a job where looking good and having energy matters, but given his personality, perhaps not very motivated by such things.

He's Agree on having an active imagination and original ideas, which might make the ad more interesting, but Disagree on being talkative and outgoing, making social aspects less important.

He is Agree on sometimes rude, which suggests he's not overly concerned with others' opinions. So maybe the ad's focus on looking good isn't that impactful for him.

In terms of purchase intent: He earns under 15M VND, so might be price-sensitive. The ad doesn't mention price, only benefits. But without trust, he might not intend to buy but could consider if it seems useful.

Perhaps:

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like – 3 (Neutral)
2. Interesting – 4 (Agree slightly)
3. Good – 4 (Slightly Agree)
4. Attractive – 3 (Neutral)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend – 3 (Mildly agree)
2. Try – 3 (Mildly agree)
3. Consider – 5 (Strongly Neutral but leaning towards consider)

Wait, no, the scale is 1-7, with 1 being Strongly Disagree and 7 Strongly Agree.

So if he's Neutral on believing the ad, that would be 4.

But in purchase intent, considering buying is higher than trying or intending. So maybe:

Intend – 3 (Mildly agree)
Try – 3
Consider – 5

Wait, but perhaps he's more likely to consider rather than intend or try.

Alternatively, since he's careless and tends not to follow through, perhaps his intention scores are lower.

I think I need to settle on specific numbers. Maybe:

Ad attitude: [2, 3, 4, 3]

Purchase intent: [3, 3, 5]

But that seems inconsistent.

Wait, let me think again. He's Neutral on being trusting (so maybe belief in the ad is around 4). The ad is about energy and looking good, which for an office worker might be somewhat relevant but not a top priority given his personality traits.

So:

1. Like – Maybe 3
2. Interesting – 4
3. Good – 4
4. Attractive – 3

Purchase intent:

Intend to purchase: 3 (Mildly agree)
Try to buy: 3
Consider buying: 5 (Agree)

Yes, that makes sense.
