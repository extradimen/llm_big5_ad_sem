Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how someone with a specific demographic and personality would respond to this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let's break down the person's background. They're from China, male, over 60, have a postgraduate degree, are a student, live with parents, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, they're talkative (Agree), outgoing but neutral on that, reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), trusting (Strongly Agree), not rude (SD), thorough (SA), doesn't always follow through with plans (Disagree), tends to be careless (Agree), gets nervous sometimes (Neutral), doesn't worry much (Disagree), emotionally stable (Neutral), has an active imagination (Agree), not very original (Disagree), and has strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

Hmm, so the person is reserved, thorough, helpful, trusting, but tends to be careless. They don't make plans well, are sometimes careless, and maybe a bit nervous. But they have an active imagination.

The ad's message is about energy and looking good daily. Given their age (>60), I wonder if this is relevant? Maybe they're looking for something that helps with staying energized as one ages, but the part about "look your best" might be less of a priority compared to health benefits. 

They are thorough, so they might want evidence or proof before believing the ad. They are trusting but also cautious. Their personality is reserved and helpful, which might make them prefer ads that are more informative rather than overly enthusiastic.

Purchase intention: Since they're over 60, maybe their spending habits are more conservative. Also, being a student on a lower income, they might not have much disposable income for such products. However, if the product is positioned as health-focused and energy-boosting, it could be appealing.

But they tend to be careless (Agree) which might mean they don't always pay attention to ads or follow through on purchases. They sometimes make plans but don't always follow through (Disagree). So even if they like the ad, they might not intend to buy.

Looking at their personality, being helpful and unselfish could make them care about products that benefit others, but this drink is self-focused. Maybe not a strong motivator for them.

Their active imagination might help them visualize the benefits of the product, making the ad more effective in some ways, but if they're reserved, they might not be easily persuaded by emotional appeals alone.

So for attitude towards the ad: They might find it somewhat interesting because of the energy aspect, but perhaps not very appealing. Maybe neutral to slightly disagree on whether it's good or attractive.

Purchase intention: They might consider buying it, especially if they value health and energy, but their tendency to be careless and not follow through might lower their intent. Also, financial constraints could play a role.

So scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like - Neutral (4)
2. Interesting - Agree (5)
3. Good - Neutral (4)
4. Attractive - Disagree (3)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend - Maybe 3
2. Try to buy - 3
3. Consider - 4

But I'm not sure about these numbers yet.
