Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my attitude towards this advertisement and my purchase intention based on the given demographic profile and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The main selling points here are energy and appearance. It's targeting people who want to feel energetic and look good daily.

Now, looking at my demographic profile:
- I'm a blue-collar worker in China, which means my job might be physically demanding.
- My monthly income is quite high for a blue-collar worker (36–45 million VND), so maybe I have some disposable income.
- I'm divorced, which might affect my lifestyle choices but not necessarily my product preferences.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Disagree → I don't see myself as someone who talks a lot.
- Outgoing: Neutral → Maybe sometimes, but not always.
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree → So maybe I'm more on the extroverted side?
Wait, that seems contradictory. If reserved is strongly disagree, then I'm not reserved, so perhaps outgoing? But outgoing was neutral. Hmm.

Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree → This might affect how I perceive ads that rely on emotions like helping others.
Trusting: Strongly Agree → So I tend to trust things more easily.
Sometimes rude: Disagree → Not really my behavior.
Thorough job: Agree → I do take care in what I do.
Making plans and following through: Strongly Disagree → Maybe not very organized or consistent with plans.
Careless: Agree → Sometimes, I might make mistakes or not pay attention to details.
Nervous easily: Agree → Could affect how I react to stress or ads that target my anxiety.
Worry a lot: Neutral → Not overly concerned but sometimes.
Emotionally stable: Neutral → So maybe not very affected by emotional appeals in ads.
Active imagination: Agree → I can come up with ideas, which might make me more open to creative ads.
Original/new ideas: Disagree → Maybe not the most innovative person.
Artistic interests: Neutral → Not particularly into art or creative stuff.

Now, evaluating the ad's message of energy and looking good. As a blue-collar worker, maybe I need something that gives me energy for my job. The ad is positive, focusing on daily benefits, which could appeal to someone who values consistency and appearance.

Attitude towards the ad:
1. Do I like it? Since I'm not very talkative or outgoing, but have an active imagination, maybe a creative ad would catch my attention. But the message is about energy and looking good, which are pretty broad. It's neutral but positive. I might not strongly dislike it, so maybe around 3.
2. Interesting: The concept of combining energy with appearance is somewhat common, so perhaps not very interesting. Maybe a 4?
3. Good: It's a straightforward message without any red flags. Probably a middle score like 4.
4. Attractive: The ad uses positive imagery, but since I'm more reserved (or maybe outgoing?), it might be okay. But given my personality, I'm not sure if I find it extremely attractive. Maybe 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? High price might be a concern despite the income. The benefits are appealing, but as someone who sometimes worries a lot and is careless, maybe not convinced enough. So 4.
2. Try to buy: Given that I'm trusting but also not highly motivated by this ad's message, perhaps a 3.
3. Consider buying: It's on my mind, so a higher score like 5.

Wait, but let me re-examine the traits. Since I'm strongly disagreeing with being helpful and unselfish, maybe the ad doesn't appeal to that aspect. But the ad isn't targeting that trait. The main points are energy and looking good, which might align more with someone who values personal appearance and health.

Also, considering my income is high for a blue-collar worker, perhaps I can afford premium products. However, being careless and sometimes rude doesn't directly relate but might make me less likely to be swayed by the ad's emotional appeal. Since I'm emotionally stable, maybe I don't get too excited about ads that play on emotions.

So overall, my态度 towards the ad is somewhat positive but not strongly so. My purchase intention is moderate because while the benefits are appealing, there's no strong emotional hook for me, and I might be more practical in my purchasing decisions.
