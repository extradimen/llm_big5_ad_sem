Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. Let's start by understanding the given information.

The person is a male from China under 20 with a bachelor's degree and works as a managerial employee. He has a monthly income of 16-25 million VND, which is pretty high for his age. He's divorced, so maybe he's independent or values personal time.

Looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree – So he's not a chatterbox.
- Outgoing: Disagree – Not very social either.
- Reserved: Neutral – Sometimes introverted.
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral – Doesn't show strong tendencies either way.
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree – He doesn’t trust easily.
- Rude sometimes: Agree – Might come off as not too friendly.
- Thorough job: Neutral – Doesn't have a strong work ethic preference.
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Agree – Very goal-oriented.
- Careless: Agree – Not detail-oriented.
- Gets nervous easily: Neutral – Mixed feelings about stress.
- Worry a lot: Neutral – No strong tendency to worry.
- Emotionally stable: Agree – Stable in his emotions.
- Active imagination: Neutral – Doesn't have a clear leaning towards creativity.
- Original and creative: Disagree – Not much of an innovator.
- Artistic interests: Strongly Agree – But maybe not deeply involved.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who are concerned about looking energetic and fresh. It's a prevention message because it warns about negative consequences (feeling tired, looking dull) if they don't use the product.

I need to evaluate how this person would react to the ad based on his traits.

First, attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: He might not find it likable because he's reserved and maybe not swayed by such ads easily.
2. Interesting: It's a common message but since he's agreeable to being careful (maybe not), perhaps neutral.
3. Good: If the ad is truthful, but considering his distrust, probably neutral.
4. Attractive: The ad might be seen as too generic or not appealing enough for him.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: He plans and follows through, so if convinced, he might intend to buy. But he's agreeable to being careless, so maybe lower intent.
2. Try: His planning trait could make him consider trying it, but his carelessness might reduce that.
3. Consider: With his planning tendency, he might think about it.

But considering his high income and age, maybe the ad is more targeted towards older or different demographics. Also, he's emotionally stable but not necessarily concerned with appearing dull.

So overall, he might find the ad somewhat neutral in appeal and not strongly consider purchasing.
