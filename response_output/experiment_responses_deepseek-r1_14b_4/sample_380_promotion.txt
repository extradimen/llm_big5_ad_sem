Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the given scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad is clear and positive but doesn't seem to target my specific needs. Since I'm more reserved and don't focus on appearance much, it doesn't resonate strongly. So, a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message is straightforward but lacks depth or emotional appeal for me. Without relatable benefits, it's only somewhat interesting. A 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - While the content isn't negative, it doesn't address my priorities like stability or thoroughness. It feels generic, so a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visuals and message are appealing on a surface level but don't connect with me personally. A 5 seems fair.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My cautious nature makes me wait for more information or reviews before buying. Intention is low, so a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without a strong reason or need, I'm not motivated to seek it out actively. A 3 reflects some consideration but no urgency.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on my radar if the price is right or if others recommend it, so a 4 shows mild consideration.
