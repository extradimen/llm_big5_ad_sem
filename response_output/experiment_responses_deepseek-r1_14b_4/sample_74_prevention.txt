Okay, I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the given advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand her background: She's a Chinese woman in her 30s, with a high school education, currently a student, divorced, and earns between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she is talkative but not outgoing or reserved. She finds it hard to be helpful and unselfish, isn't trusting, sometimes rude, neutral about thoroughness, disagrees with being careless, neutral on getting nervous, worries a lot, is emotionally stable, has an active imagination, but doesn't consider herself original or artistic.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Now, evaluating the ad from her perspective. She likes ads that are clear and make sense to her. The ad's message seems straightforward—it suggests that without the drink, one might feel tired and appear unattractive. This could appeal to someone looking for an energy boost or wanting to maintain their appearance.

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad. — Since she is talkative but not outgoing, maybe she values clear communication. The ad is direct, so she might agree it's good but perhaps not love it. Maybe a 4/7.
2. I think the ad is interesting. — She has an active imagination and likes new ideas, even though she doesn't consider herself original. The ad isn't overly creative, so maybe a 3/7.
3. I believe the ad is good. — The message is clear but might feel manipulative. Her tendency to worry could make her skeptical of such ads. Maybe a 3/7.
4. I find the ad attractive. — She's emotionally stable but not sure if she finds this particular ad visually or conceptually appealing. Perhaps a 3/7.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. — She is goal-oriented, as indicated by her strong agreement in making plans and following through. If she feels the drink meets a need, maybe a 4/7.
2. I will try to buy this product. — Trying new products isn't something she's strongly aligned with; she tends to be careful. Maybe a 3/7.
3. I will consider buying this product. — She is practical and might weigh options carefully. So, likely a 4/7.

Putting it all together, her scores would reflect a neutral stance on liking the ad but some consideration towards purchasing if it meets her needs.
