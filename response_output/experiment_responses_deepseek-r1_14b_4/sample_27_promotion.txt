Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's start by understanding their background and personality.

They're a male from China over 60, married, with a high income and a managerial position. He has a high school education. Personality-wise, he tends to agree that he's talkative but disagree being outgoing. He's neutral about being reserved. Helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, isn't good at following through plans, and tends to be careless. He gets nervous easily? Neutral, worries a lot—agrees, not emotionally stable, has an active imagination but agrees he's original.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Thinking about his values: he's helpful, trusting, sometimes rude. He doesn't plan much or follow through, is careless. Maybe this makes him less likely to trust the product? Or maybe the energetic aspect resonates since he's a manager with responsibilities.

He's over 60—maybe looking for something that boosts energy but also makes him look good. The ad combines two benefits: staying energized and looking his best daily, which could appeal to someone in his position who wants to maintain a professional image.

But considering his traits like sometimes being rude might not align with the positive image portrayed by the ad. Also, he's not very trusting of ads? Or maybe since he strongly agrees he's trusting, but also tends to be careless and doesn't follow through on plans. 

His tendency to worry a lot could make him cautious about the product's claims. But his agreeable nature with being helpful might mean he's more open to positive messaging.

So for ad attitude:

1. I like the ad: Maybe neutral or low, because while the message is positive, his cautiousness and lack of thoroughness might not make him strongly like it.
2. Interesting: He might find it interesting if it highlights benefits relevant to his age group and position.
3. Good: His trust in people could make him think the ad is good, but maybe not strong agreement.
4. Attractive: The visual appeal of the ad would matter; without knowing visuals, perhaps neutral.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend: He might be unsure, given his tendency to be careless and not follow through on plans. Maybe low.
2. Try: Might be willing to try it once but not sure about long-term commitment.
3. Consider: He's considering, but not certain, based on his indecisiveness.

So, scores could be:

Ad attitude: 3,4,3,4
Purchase intention: 3,3,4

Wait, but let me think again. His high income might make him more open to buying products, even if he's less trusting of ads. The benefits of energy and looking good are appealing for a manager.

Maybe the ad is more interesting (4), good (5?), attractive (5). But considering his tendency to be careless, maybe not fully convinced.

Purchase intention: He might intend (3) because it seems useful, try (3), but considering (4).

Alternatively, if he's helpful and trusting, he might like the ad more. Maybe ad attitude scores higher.

I'm a bit torn. Perhaps:

Ad态度：
1. Like: 4
2. Interesting:5
3. Good:5
4. Attractive:4

Purchase意图:
1. Intend:4
2. Try:4
3. Consider:5

This makes sense because he's considering it, maybe even intending to try but not fully sure.
