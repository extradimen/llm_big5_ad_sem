Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. The user is a 50-59-year-old Chinese man with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker and earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. He's divorced, which might affect his spending habits or lifestyle choices.

His personality traits show he's reserved but helpful and trusting. He tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries sometimes, is emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original with new ideas, and few artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It targets fatigue and appearance, which are relevant for someone in their 50s, possibly dealing with work stress or health concerns.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad. - He's reserved but helpful; maybe not strongly positive. Score: 3.
2. Interesting? The message is clear but might not be compelling enough. Score: 4.
3. Good? It addresses real issues, so neutral. Score: 5.
4. Attractive? Not particularly appealing to him due to his reserved nature. Score: 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend? He's more about practical needs; maybe neutral. Score: 4.
2. Try? Might consider but not immediately. Score: 4.
3. Consider? Yes, as it addresses fatigue and appearance, which are relevant. Score: 5.
