Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, understanding the demographic and personality traits of the individual is crucial. He's a Chinese male in his 40s with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, which suggests he might be more conservative or value-oriented. His monthly income is quite high, so he can afford premium products. Being divorced might mean he has certain lifestyle preferences or priorities regarding how he spends his money.

Looking at the personality traits: He's outgoing and sociable but also reserved. That could mean he values social interactions but isn't overly extroverted. He's helpful and neutral on being unselfish, which suggests a moderate level of concern for others. Trusting is neutral, so maybe he's cautious about claims made in ads. Sometimes rude: that might make him less likely to be swayed by overly emotional or manipulative ads. He does thorough jobs and makes plans, indicating he's methodical in his decisions. Not careless, which means he's detail-oriented. Emotional stability is neutral, so not too affected by emotional appeals. Lacks an active imagination and isn't original, but has strong artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention message, focusing on the negative consequences of not using the product.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: He might find it effective if it addresses real concerns about energy and appearance, but his neutral stance on emotional stability could make him less swayed by fear appeals. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging for someone who values thoroughness and might see it as too simplistic. Perhaps a 3.
3. Good: It conveys a clear benefit, but given his cautious nature, he might not find it compelling enough. Maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: Prevention messages can be effective, but without emotional depth, it might not be very attractive to him. Maybe a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's methodical and might need more evidence or a stronger reason than just feeling tired or looking dull. A 2.
2. Try to buy: Given his income level, he might consider trying it if the ad is compelling enough, but since the ad feels a bit generic, maybe a 3.
3. Consider buying: There's some consideration because of his high income and potential need for such products, but without strong emotional appeal, perhaps a 4.

I think these scores reflect a moderate response where he acknowledges the ad's message but isn't deeply convinced or motivated to act immediately.
