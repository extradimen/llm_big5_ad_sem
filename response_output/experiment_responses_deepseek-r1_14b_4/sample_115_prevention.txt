Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, considering the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink, it targets personal appearance and energy levels. Given my personality traits, especially being reserved and having few artistic interests, this ad might not resonate strongly with me. It feels a bit superficial since I prioritize other aspects of life over such concerns.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad.** - The message is somewhat compelling but not enough for me to feel a strong liking towards it. So, I'd score it around 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's okay, but not particularly engaging given my reserved nature and lack of interest in appearance-related products. Maybe a 3 here too.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The concept is simple and clear, which is good, but it doesn't go deep into what I value. So, a 4 seems fair.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - It's visually okay but not very attractive to someone who isn't focused on appearance. A 3 fits here.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad doesn't strongly connect with my needs or preferences, so I'm unlikely to intend a purchase. A 2 makes sense.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without a strong desire or belief in the product's benefits for me, trying it isn't something I'd consider much. Another 2 here.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Given that I'm over 60 and have a high income, maybe I might think about it, but it's not a priority. So, a 3 is appropriate.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly appeal to my personality or needs, leading to low scores in both attitude towards the ad and purchase intentions.
