Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're from China, over 60 years old, have a high school education, are a student (which might mean they have some disposable income but could be on a budget), divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. Their personality traits show they are outgoing and sociable but also reserved, which is conflicting. They don't trust people much, aren't helpful, tend to be thorough, plan things well, aren't careless, don't get nervous easily, aren't very stable emotionally, have an active imagination, and don't necessarily come up with new ideas but do have artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with their attitude toward the ad. They like ads that are interesting and good but might not find it attractive if it's too flashy or doesn't resonate with them personally. Since they're both outgoing and reserved, maybe they value something balanced but could be turned off by overpromising claims.

For purchase intention: They make thorough plans and follow through, so if the ad makes a convincing case, they might intend to buy. But since they don't trust people much and worry sometimes, credibility is key. If the drink seems too good to be true, they might not try it or consider buying it despite considering.

Scoring each point: 

1. I like the ad. - Neutral (4)
2. Interesting? Maybe a 3 because while the message is clear, their personality doesn't lean heavily towards finding it very interesting.
3. Good? They might agree on some level but not strongly (4).
4. Attractive? Not really, since they're reserved and the ad's energy might be too much (2).

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy - Neutral (4)
2. Try to buy - Maybe a 3 because they plan well but aren't convinced enough.
3. Consider buying - Agreed (5), as it's an option, though not a priority.

I think these scores reflect their cautious nature and mixed personality traits.
