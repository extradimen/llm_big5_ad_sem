Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So, first, I need to understand her background and personality based on what's given.

She’s from China, over 60 years old, living with her parents, has a bachelor's degree but no specific occupation mentioned. Her monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which I think is about $700 USD or so. That might be a tight budget for some products. She’s more reserved (she strongly disagrees with being outgoing), which could mean she’s not the type to be swayed by overly social ads. But she does agree that she's helpful and unselfish, maybe implying she cares about her appearance for others.

Looking at her personality traits: she is talkative neutrally but outgoing as well. She doesn’t think she’s reserved, so maybe she values social interactions but isn't the life of the party. She helps others but not a lot, so perhaps she's community-oriented but not overly so. Trusting, which is good for ads, and she’s thorough in her work—maybe she expects products to be reliable.

She makes plans and follows through, so if she decides to buy something, she'll stick with it. But since she tends to be careless strongly disagree, maybe she's meticulous. She gets nervous easily but disagrees on that too. However, she worries a lot, which might mean she’s cautious about spending. Emotionally stable, so less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals. She has an active imagination and original ideas, but agrees she has few artistic interests—maybe practical in her approach.

Now, the ad is for a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So it's targeting health and appearance. Given her age, she might be concerned about staying energetic and looking good as she gets older.

For her ad attitude:

1. I like the ad: She’s reserved but not strongly against being outgoing. The message is positive—energy and looks. Since she agrees with trusting people, maybe she likes it if it seems trustworthy. But since she's careful, she might need more evidence. So a 4 or 5?

2. Interesting: It's a health drink, which could be interesting to someone her age looking for energy. Maybe a 5.

3. Good: If the ad is well-made and truthful, she might agree it’s good. But since she's cautious, maybe 6? Or lower if she thinks it's too flashy.

4. Attractive: Depends on how appealing the visuals are. If it shows active people her age, maybe it's attractive—perhaps a 5 or 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She’s thorough and follows through but worries a lot about spending money. Maybe she needs more info before intending to buy—maybe 3.

2. Try to buy: If the ad convinces her of benefits, she might consider trying it once. Perhaps a 4.

3. Consider buying: Given her cautious nature, she might think about it seriously but not immediately. Maybe a 5? Or lower if she’s unsure.
