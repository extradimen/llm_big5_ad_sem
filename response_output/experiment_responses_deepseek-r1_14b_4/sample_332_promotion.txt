Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So, first, I need to break down their demographic and personality traits.

They're a Chinese-speaking woman in her 30s-40s, have a postgraduate degree, work in an office, are divorced, and earn around 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, so she might be looking for quality products that offer value.

Looking at her personality traits: She is reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Agree), and generally trusting (Strongly Agree). However, she doesn't consider herself outgoing or talkative. So, the ad needs to appeal to someone who values trust and personal benefits without being too social.

The advertisement says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: Since she's reserved and helpful, she might appreciate an ad that highlights personal well-being and trustworthiness. The message is positive and aspirational, so she could find it likable but not overly exciting.

2. I think the ad is interesting: Given her reserved nature, she might not find it extremely interesting unless it has unique or compelling visuals. Maybe a 5 on interest since it's about health, which is relevant to her.

3. I believe the ad is good: She trusts others strongly, so if the ad presents the product as reliable and effective, she's more likely to trust it. But without specific evidence, maybe a 6.

4. I find the ad attractive: The visual appeal matters here. If the ad has high-quality visuals that align with her values of looking good and staying energized, she might find it attractive, perhaps around a 5 or 6.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product: She's careful and thorough but tends not to make plans easily. High income means she might look for premium products, so the ad needs to highlight effectiveness and quality. A 4 here because she's cautious about purchases unless convinced.

2. I will try to buy this product: Trying a new product might require more evidence or a discount. Maybe a 3 since she isn't冲动型买家.

3. I will consider buying this product: Considering is likely, given her trust in the ad and the product’s benefits. A higher score here, maybe a 5.

I think she's rational and values trust, so the ad needs to build credibility beyond just catchy phrases.
