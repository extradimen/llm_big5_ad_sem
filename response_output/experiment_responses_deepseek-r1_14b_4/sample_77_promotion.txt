Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding my background: I'm from China, male, in my 30s, have a high school education, work as a blue-collar worker, am divorced, and earn between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. My income is decent but not extremely high. As for personality traits, I tend to be helpful and unselfish, thorough in my work, and have an active imagination. However, I'm not outgoing, can sometimes be rude, find it hard to trust people easily, and worry a lot.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is about energy and looking good, which are positive attributes. But considering my personality, I'm not very outgoing or sociable (Strongly Disagree on being outgoing). Maybe this ad targets someone more social, so it might not resonate much with me. I'm neutral towards liking it because while the message is good, it doesn't particularly align with my lifestyle.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone working hard like me. It's a relatable message but might feel too generic. Since I have an active imagination (Agree), maybe the ad could be more creative to catch my interest. But as it stands, it's somewhat interesting but not extremely so.

3. Is the ad good? The benefits are clear—energy and appearance—but the ad feels a bit simplistic. My education level is high school, so I can understand it, but perhaps it needs more depth or evidence to convince me it's effective. Without specific details, I'm moderately positive about it being good but not overwhelmingly.

4. Is the ad attractive? The visual appeal depends on how it's presented, which I don't know. Since I tend to worry a lot and am not very trusting (Disagree), the ad needs to build credibility. If it's visually appealing and trustworthy, it might attract me, but without more info, I'm neutral.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? My monthly income is decent, so spending on such a drink might be considered. However, I worry about the effectiveness without evidence (Disagree), and my thorough nature means I'd need proof before buying. So, low intent here.

2. Will I try to buy it? Given that I'm not very trusting and have concerns about its effectiveness, trying it would require some assurance or recommendation. Without that, I'm hesitant, so maybe a 3 on the scale.

3. Would I consider buying it? The idea is appealing for energy, especially with my active job as a blue-collar worker. It's something I might think about if someone recommends it or offers proof of its benefits. So, considering all factors, I would consider it but not rush to buy.
