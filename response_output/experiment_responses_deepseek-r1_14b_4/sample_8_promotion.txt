Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like (score=5)**: The ad is positive but doesn't resonate deeply because while staying energized and looking good are good points, they don't specifically address my preferences like being helpful or trusting.
2. **Interesting (score=4)**: It's somewhat interesting as it highlights benefits, but the message isn't unique or tailored to me personally.
3. **Good (score=5)**: The ad is well-made and positive, which I appreciate, even if it doesn't strongly appeal to me.
4. **Attractive (score=6)**: The visuals and message are attractive, especially focusing on energy and appearance, which are appealing qualities.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend (score=5)**: It's a good product, but I'm not convinced enough to intend buying it right away.
2. **Try (score=4)**: I might consider trying it if others recommend it, but the ad alone isn't persuasive enough.
3. **Consider (score=6)**: The benefits are appealing, so I would definitely keep it in mind for future purchase decisions.

Overall, while the ad is positive and has good points, it doesn't align strongly with my personal values or needs, so my interest is moderate.
