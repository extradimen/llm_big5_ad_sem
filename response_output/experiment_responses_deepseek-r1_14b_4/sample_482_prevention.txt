Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is pretty straightforward and uses relatable emotions about tiredness and looking dull. However, it feels a bit generic and not very engaging. So, maybe a 4? Because while I understand its message, it doesn't really excite me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** There's nothing particularly unique or captivating here. It's just another energy drink ad. So, probably a 3 since it's somewhat interesting but not standout.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The message is clear, but it lacks creativity and depth. I don't feel convinced by the ad alone. So, maybe a 4 as it's okay but not impressive.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Again, nothing visually or conceptually appealing here. It's functional but doesn't attract me much. A 3 seems fair.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** The ad makes a good point about tiredness and looking dull, which are concerns for many. But I'm not convinced it's the best solution, so my intent is lowâ€”maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong personal motivation or belief in its effectiveness, I'm hesitant to try it. So, a 3 here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It has some merit, but I might not act on it unless there's more compelling reason. A 4 as I'm somewhat open to considering it under the right circumstances.
