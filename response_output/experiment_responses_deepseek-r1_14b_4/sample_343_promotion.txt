Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive traits. However, based on my personality, I tend to be reserved and sometimes rude, so maybe I'm not immediately drawn to such a upbeat message. Plus, I don't have a high income, so luxury products might not appeal to me. So, I'd give it a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The promise of energy and looking good sounds appealing, but I'm not sure how relevant it is to my daily life. My main focus is probably on more practical needs. Hence, a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: I don't have strong feelings either way. It's neither making me strongly agree nor disagree. So, neutral at 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Again, not particularly attracted to it because of my reserved nature and practical spending habits. A 3 here.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: I'm skeptical about such claims without evidence. Plus, with a limited income, I might prioritize basic needs over a pricey drink. So, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong motivation or evidence, it's unlikely I'd make an effort to buy it. A 3 seems appropriate.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's not something I'm dismissing outright, but it's also not at the top of my list. Maybe a 4 because I might think about it if someone else recommends it, but that's stretching it.
