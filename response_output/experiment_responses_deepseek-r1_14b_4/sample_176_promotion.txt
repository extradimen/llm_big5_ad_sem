Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let's break down my background. I'm from China, male, 20-29 years old, postgraduate education, work in an office, divorced, and earn between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix of neutral, some strong disagrees, and a few agrees.

Looking at the ad's message, it's targeting someone who wants energy and to look their best daily. Since I'm an office worker, staying energized makes sense because my job might be stressful or require focus. However, looking my best every day is something that varies based on personality. 

My personality traits: I'm talkative and outgoing but neutral about it. Reserved? Strongly disagree, so maybe I'm more of a social person. Helpful and unselfish? Also strongly disagree, so perhaps I'm more self-centered. Generally trusting? Disagree, so maybe cautious. Sometimes rude? Disagree as well. Thorough job? Agree, which is good for product evaluation. Making plans and following through? Strongly disagree, so not very organized. Careless? Strongly agree, so that could affect my decision-making. Nervous easily? Agree, worried a lot—Agree too, but emotionally stable—Strongly agree. Active imagination and original ideas? Agree on the first, strongly disagree on being original.

So, considering all this: I'm someone who might be social but not overly trusting, perhaps a bit careless and not very organized. But I do thorough work and have an active imagination.

The ad's main selling points are energy and looking good. Since I'm in my 20s-30s, postgrad, working in an office, maybe I care about appearing professional and energetic. However, being strongly disagree with helpfulness and trust might make me skeptical of the product's claims. Also, being careless and sometimes making plans but not following through could mean I'm more impulsive but might not stick to products long-term.

On the other hand, valuing thoroughness and having an active imagination makes me open to trying new things if it seems beneficial. Plus, being talkative and outgoing means I might share this product with others if I find it effective.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude towards me: Do I like it? Maybe not strongly because of the skepticism. Interesting? Perhaps a bit, but not extremely so. Good? Not sure yet, as trust is an issue. Attractive? It depends on how it's presented visually and whether it resonates with my desire to look good.

Purchase intention: Intend to purchase—probably low because of trust issues and maybe not feeling the need. Try to buy—it might be a 3 or 4, maybe neutral. Consider buying—if it's positioned well, I might think about it, so maybe a higher score here.

Putting this all together, my scores would reflect that I'm somewhat interested but not strongly convinced enough to purchase immediately. I'm cautious and skeptical, which lowers the ad's effectiveness for me.
