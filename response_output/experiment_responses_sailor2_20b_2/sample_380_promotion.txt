**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (score = 3) — The ad seems okay but not particularly engaging.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (score = 4) — It catches my attention with its promise of energy and looking good, which are relevant to daily life.
   - **Good:** Mostly agree (score = 5) — The message is clear about staying energized and improving appearance; reasonable for a health-focused product.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (score = 2) — While the concept resonates somewhat, it doesn't have strong visual appeal or emotional connection to me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Moderately agree (score = 3) — It's on my mind but not a firm commitment.
   - **Try to buy:** Neutral (score = 3) — I might give it a try if conveniently available or recommended by someone trustworthy.
   - **Consider buying:** Somewhat considerate (score = 2) — The ad makes me think, but there are other factors like price and personal needs that would influence my final decision.

Given my personality traits emphasizing sociability yet feeling nervous/worried about daily performance, the appeal to energy and appearance is relevant. However, being cautious and less influenced by flashy ads balances out the positive aspects, leading to moderate intentions without strong commitment or immediate action.
