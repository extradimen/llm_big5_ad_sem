**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 5)**: Neutral-to-positive because it targets common feelings of fatigue and dullness which resonate with my busy managerial life.
   - **Interesting (Score: 6)**: Strongly agree; the "without this drink" premise creates curiosity about its benefits.
   - **Good (Score: 4)**: Agree; while not outstanding, the ad effectively communicates a potential issue (feeling tired and looking dull) and proposes an easy solution.
   - **Attractive (Score: 7)**: Strongly agree; it visually appeals to my desire for energy and vitality.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Neutral (3); the ad is persuasive, but I need more information on ingredients, efficacy, and personal fit.
   - **Try to buy**: Slightly disagree (2); though tempted, a lower risk approach would be trying it after reviews or samples.
   - **Consider buying**: Agree (4); my thorough planning trait means I'll weigh the product based on additional research before making a final decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's engagement and attractiveness, practicality and further evaluation are required to move towards an actual purchase.
