**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)** - The advertisement's promise of energy and appearance improvement resonates somewhat with my needs, but it doesn't excite me deeply.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)** - Itâ€™s reasonably engaging as I'm aware of such products, though not compelling enough to draw strong interest.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 2)** - While understandable and well-meaning, it doesn't strike me as particularly unique or effective in its messaging.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - The visuals and claims are decent but fall short of being genuinely appealing given my daily priorities.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 1)** - Given my budget constraints, energy drinks might be a luxury I cannot afford regularly.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - There's a slight curiosity, but overall financial limitations and the fact that cheaper alternatives exist make it unlikely.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 3)** - The idea isn't entirely out of mind, particularly during low-energy moments; however, practicality remains my primary consideration.

In summary, while I acknowledge its benefits and understand its target appeal, budgetary concerns and personal priorities lower the effectiveness of the advertisement for a purchase decision.
