**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like:* Neutral (5) — While I appreciate the idea of staying energized, it doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm given my personal priorities.
  - *Interesting:* Slightly Agree (4) — The concept is somewhat engaging but lacks a compelling hook for me personally.
  - *Good:* Disagree (3) — Despite being an energetic professional, I feel skepticism about the product's effectiveness without tangible proof or deeper information.
  - *Attractive:* Disagree (2) — The broad claims and general appeal don't resonate with my cautious nature regarding health products.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Strongly Disagree (1) — Without specific details on efficacy, ingredients, or personal testimonials from people like me, I'm not convinced.
  - *Try to Buy:* Strongly Disagree (1) — My financial constraints and the lack of compelling evidence make it unlikely for a trial purchase.
  - *Consider Buying:* Disagree (2) — Given my strong preference for thoroughness and trust in established brands/products with proven results, I am not inclined to consider this product even as an option.

In summary, while acknowledging its relevance conceptually, the ad falls short of convincing me due to lackluster presentation, insufficient details, and personal alignment factors. Therefore, both engagement and purchase intent are minimal for someone like myself.
