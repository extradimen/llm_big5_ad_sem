**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (4)
   - Given my sociable nature and tendency towards helpfulness, an engaging message could appeal to me somewhat but not strongly.

2. **Interesting** (5): Agree
   - The preventive aspect of feeling tired or looking dull taps into common experiences, making it intriguing enough to hold attention momentarily.

3. **Good**: Disagree (3)
   - While the concept is clear, I question whether such a claim genuinely reflects my needs or lifestyle given other priorities and health concerns.

4. **Attractive**: Strongly Disagree (2)
   - The ad's manipulative tone of "without this drink" feels heavy-handed, lacking in genuine persuasion despite its social nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Despite occasional carelessness, I prioritize thoroughness and planning; the urgency implied here isn’t compelling enough for an immediate decision.

2. **Try to buy**: Strongly Disagree (2)
   - The ad’s direct approach conflicts with my skepticism about quick fixes without deeper analysis or personal relevance.

3. **Consider buying**: Disagree (3)
   - While not ruling it out entirely, the high level of trust issues and tendency towards originality means I’ll need more evidence before seriously considering this product.

Overall, while the ad makes some points effectively in engaging interest briefly, it falls short on building strong intent to purchase due to its manipulative nature, lack of personal resonance, and my cautious decision-making process.
