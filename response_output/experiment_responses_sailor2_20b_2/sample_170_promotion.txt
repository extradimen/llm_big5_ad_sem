**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**
   - **Like (Score = 4):** The ad's promise of energy boost is appealing to someone my age who values staying active.
   - **Interesting (Score = 3):** It presents a relatable benefit, though the visuals and messaging might not be groundbreaking for me.
   - **Good (Score = 5):** As a generally trusting person, I find credibility in health-focused advertising, albeit moderately.
   - **Attractive (Score = 4):** The ad is visually acceptable but lacks personal emotional resonance.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score = 2):** While the benefits are enticing, my reserved and cautious nature means I’m not strongly inclined to purchase without further consideration.
   - **Try to Buy (Score = 3):** There’s enough interest for a trial but no immediate urgency or strong desire.
   - **Consider Buying (Score = 4):** The product will be on my radar, particularly if it aligns with other routine purchasing habits and budget.

This balance reflects a moderate appeal while considering personal values, trust in health products, and a pragmatic approach to new purchases.
