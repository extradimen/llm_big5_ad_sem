**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 3)**: The ad's appeal is moderate. Given my preference for social interaction but general carelessness, I acknowledge its presence without strong enthusiasm.
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: While not particularly engaging, it presents a relevant promise—energy and appearance enhancement—which could capture attention momentarily.
- **Good (Score: 2)**: The message is straightforward yet lacks the depth or creativity to stand out. It doesn't align closely with my personal values.
- **Attractive (Score: 1)**: Due to being strongly agreeable to feeling nervous easily, I find it less attractive compared to ads that focus on relaxation or simplicity.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (Score: 2)**: Despite the benefits highlighted, my current priorities lean more towards essential needs and reliability. The urgency isn't compelling enough.
- **Try (Score: 2)**: Might give it a try if offered at a lower price point, given my budget constraints ($36M–45M VND).
- **Consider (Score: 2)**: Overall, I might consider buying for short-term boosts when in need of extra energy or confidence boost. However, other factors like cost and brand reputation will heavily influence this decision.

In summary, the ad resonates at a superficial level but falls short on strong engagement due to my personality traits and priorities as an active yet somewhat careless blue-collar worker within Southeast Asia. Purchase intent remains low-key but not entirely closed off to practical consideration under suitable conditions.
