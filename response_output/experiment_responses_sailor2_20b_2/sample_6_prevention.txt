**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like (4):** While I appreciate its straightforward approach, it feels a bit over-the-top and lacks emotional depth.
   - **Interesting (3):** The message is clear but not particularly engaging; there could be more creativity involved.
   - **Good (5):** It effectively conveys the problem of fatigue and dullness associated with missing this drink, so from an informational standpoint, it's decently persuasive.
   - **Attractive (2):** Not visually or conceptually attractive enough to draw me in; needs a stronger appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend (3):** I'm not strongly inclined due to the ad alone but might consider if there are other compelling factors like reviews, brand reputation.
   - **Try (3):** There’s some curiosity but without additional reassurances or personal need right now, I wouldn't rush to try it.
   - **Consider (2):** If pushed into making a decision, my inclination is towards consideration rather than immediate action; the ad isn’t enough on its own.

Overall, while acknowledging the effectiveness of highlighting potential problems, there’s room for improvement in terms of emotional connection and attractiveness. The product might still end up being considered based on additional factors but not immediately driven by this advertisement alone.
