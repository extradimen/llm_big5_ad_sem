**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 4 (Neutral)* - The message is clear but feels slightly exaggerated and not particularly engaging for me.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 3 (Slightly Disagree)* - While it's straightforward, there isn't enough creativity or intrigue to keep my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 5 (Agree)* - The message of preventing tiredness and dull appearance aligns with common concerns; however, it lacks compelling evidence or emotional depth.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - It doesn't appeal to me visually nor emotionally due to its generic tone.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - The ad's lack of credibility and emotional connection makes it unlikely I'll make an immediate or strong intention to buy.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 3 (Neutral)* - There is no compelling reason for me to actively seek out the drink, but if conveniently offered at a good price, might give it a chance.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 4 (Agree)* - If I encounter positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources, my neutral-to-positive attitude towards preventing tiredness may tip me toward considering the purchase.

**Overall**: While the ad effectively communicates its core message, it falls short in emotional engagement and credibility for a consumer like myself. The product might be considered under specific circumstances but is unlikely to drive spontaneous purchases based on this advertisement alone.
