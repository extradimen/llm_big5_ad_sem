**Explanation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
- **I like the ad:** 6 - The claim of staying energized and looking your best is appealing.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** 5 - It captures attention with health and appearance benefits, but it's a bit overused in marketing.
- **I believe the ad is good:** 4 - While effective on surface level, credibility might be questioned due to common tropes.
- **I find the ad attractive:** 3 - The messaging isn't as engaging for me given my personality traits (dislike talkative ads).

**Purchase Intention:**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 - Neutral leaning towards low. Though appealing, I'm cautious about new products without prior reviews.
- **I will try to buy this product:** 1 - Low intent; more likely to test if recommended by trusted sources or during special offers.
- **I will consider buying the product:** 2 - Will keep it in mind for future consideration but won't rush into a purchase decision. 

Overall, the ad resonates somewhat with my preference for societal benefits and appearance enhancement, yet personal reservations (like cautiousness and thorough job approach) lead to moderate interest without strong purchasing intent.
