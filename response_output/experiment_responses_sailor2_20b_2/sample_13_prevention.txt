**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad**: 
  - *Like (2)*: The straightforward message might be slightly engaging but not particularly appealing given my reserved nature and preference for subtlety.
  - *Interesting (3)*: The claim to avoid tiredness and dull appearance piques curiosity, yet it's moderately interesting due to its commonality in product ads.
  - *Good (4)*: While the ad conveys a clear benefit, it lacks emotional or imaginative depth which I typically value; hence, "good" but not outstanding.
  - *Attractive (2)*: The tone feels somewhat manipulative and generic, making it less attractive.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend to Purchase (5)*: Even though the ad's message aligns with maintaining energy levels—a practical concern for a busy office worker—I'm not fully convinced by the pitch alone.
  - *Will Try (6)*: My tendency towards planning and following through might lead me to give it a try if available, especially since trying new products is aligned with my disciplined approach.
  - *Consider Buying (5)*: I'll certainly consider buying due to its practical appeal; however, additional factors like price, brand reputation, and personal experience would be crucial before making an actual purchase decision.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately but not strongly enough on a deeply personal level. Practical benefits contribute to positive intentions for trial or consideration, but critical evaluation remains essential.
