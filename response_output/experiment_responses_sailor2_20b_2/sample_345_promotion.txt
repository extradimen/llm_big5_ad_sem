**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like (Score: 4)*: It has a decent appeal but doesn't elicit strong enthusiasm given my generally positive outlook and sociability without being overly influenced by flashy promotions.
   - *Interesting (Score: 5)*: The message about energy and appearance is engaging, resonating with my active imagination.
   - *Good (Score: 6)*: Credibility seems moderate; the claims align reasonably well with what I value in personal health and productivity but lack compelling evidence.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: While not strikingly attractive, it holds some visual interest due to Southeast Asian aesthetic preferences.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend (Score: 2)*: Not a strong intent to buy immediately; I prefer thorough research before committing.
   - *Try (Score: 4)*: Will consider sampling or trying it, especially if offered at an event or with some form of trial incentive.
   - *Consider (Score: 5)*: Overall, the product aligns with my self-care priorities, so I am open to incorporating it into my routine post-evaluation.

The balanced evaluation reflects cautious optimismâ€”enjoying aspects without being overwhelmed by immediate purchase pressure. This approach resonates well with a mature and reflective civil servant background.
