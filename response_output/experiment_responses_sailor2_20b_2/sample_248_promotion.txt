**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
  - *Like*: Neutral (score = 3) — It doesn't strongly evoke emotions, but it's not off-putting.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (score = 4) — The concept of staying energized is engaging for daily life needs.
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree (score = 5) — Promises practical benefits which resonate with my cautious yet goal-oriented personality.
  - *Attractive*: Agree (score = 4) — It appeals to aspects like appearance and health, aligning somewhat with my preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - *Intend*: Neutral (score = 2) — While the benefits sound good, I am reserved in making immediate commitments.
  - *Try*: Neutral (score = 3) — There's a willingness to consider it but not driven by strong urgency or excitement.
  - *Consider*: Agree (score = 4) — It will be on my radar for future purchase decisions, particularly given the product's potential health and energy benefits.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's appeal to practical needs and find it interesting, the cautious nature of my personality means a strong intention isn't immediate. However, I am open to giving it a try or considering it in the near future.
