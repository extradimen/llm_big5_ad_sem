**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (4/7):** While I appreciate the message of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
  - **Interesting (5/7):** The concept is engaging but not groundbreaking for my personality—more talkative yet cautious about promises in ads.
  - **Good (3/7):** Neutral view; lacks emotional connection despite its claims of benefits.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** Not particularly appealing due to my general skepticism and carelessness regarding marketing hype.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (1/7):** Strongly disagree—while it seems useful, I'm not convinced by the ad alone.
  - **Try to Buy (2/7):** Mild interest; may consider trying if recommended or given a good deal but wouldn't make an immediate purchase decision based on this ad.
  - **Consider Buying (3/7):** Neutral-to-mildly positive, open to considering it under specific circumstances.

Overall, the ad makes some impact due to its focus on energy and appearance, aligning with my youthful goals. However, personal skepticism and preference for thoroughness mean I need more assurance or practical endorsement before buying in.
