**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad (3)**: Neutral due to my talkative nature, which makes me somewhat indifferent; it doesn't grab immediate attention.
   - **Interesting (4)**: Agree because staying energized resonates with my busy lifestyle and pursuit of a good appearance.
   - **Good (5)**: Strongly Agree since the promise aligns well with maintaining productivity and confidence—key values for someone balancing studies, family life, and social engagements.
   - **Attractive (6)**: Agree; visually appealing ads are more likely to catch my eye, enhancing its attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral as the ad’s message is compelling but I need concrete benefits and trust in the product quality before making a purchase.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Agree; given my monthly income can support it, trying once seems reasonable due to its potential positive impact on energy levels.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree because despite being cautious (Disagree with thorough job), I find the idea of looking and feeling great appealing enough to seriously consider adding this product to my routine. 

In summary, while I appreciate aspects of the ad and see value in its claims, full intention hinges on further personal experience or reviews ensuring it meets expectations.
