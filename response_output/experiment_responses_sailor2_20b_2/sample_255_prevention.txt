**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
  - **Like (score=3):** As a reserved and generally trusting individual with an active but cautious approach to life, the ad feels somewhat persuasive but not overly engaging. I appreciate its message on avoiding fatigue and dullness.
  - **Interesting (score=4):** The concept of looking tired resonates as it aligns with practical concerns about appearances and well-being in daily work-life balance.
  - **Good (score=5):** While the ad effectively targets common issues, such as feeling tired or looking less vibrant, I find its overall message reassuringly straightforward without being overly sensationalized.
  - **Attractive (score=2):** Despite agreeing that preventing tiredness is important, the presentation doesn't captivate me enough. The design and tone need more appeal to stand out.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** At a score of 2, I am not strongly inclined due to budget constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND), making luxury or non-essential items less feasible.
  - **Try to Buy:** With a score of 3, there is moderate curiosity driven by its practical benefits; however, cost considerations and availability might limit immediate action.
  - **Consider Buying:** At a 4, I am open-minded enough to consider it if the product seems genuinely effective and affordable in comparison with my current options.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates moderately well due to its clear message on fatigue prevention, other factors (cost, personal preference for simplicity) keep purchase intentions moderate.
