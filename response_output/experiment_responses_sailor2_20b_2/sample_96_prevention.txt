**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Neutral):** The ad is informative but not particularly appealing for someone like me who values practicality over emotional engagement.
   - **Interesting (Agree):** It does highlight the potential drawbacks of lacking energy, making it relevant to daily life concerns.
   - **Good (Agree):** The message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance seems well-articulated and focused on common issues among my age group.
   - **Attractive (Disagree):** While I appreciate its clarity, its emotional appeal is weak for me; hence, it doesn't feel particularly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral leaning towards agree because the ad addresses a genuine concern of staying energetic and looking good.
   - **Try to Buy:** Agree as I'm open-minded about trying new products if they promise tangible benefits.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree since it aligns with my careful planning trait; though not immediately purchasing, I'll definitely keep this option in mind.

Overall, the ad resonates logically but lacks emotional depth for me. While not overly compelling visually or emotionally, its practicality and clarity drive a moderate level of interest and consideration towards making a purchase decision later on.
