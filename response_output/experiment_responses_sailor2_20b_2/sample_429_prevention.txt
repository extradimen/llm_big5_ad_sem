**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: *Scored as 4* (Neutral/Agree)
   - While I appreciate the direct approach to addressing fatigue and appearance concerns, my generally talkative and outgoing nature means I don't feel strongly connected but find it effective.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Scored as 5* (Agree)
   - The prevention aspect piques curiosity about maintaining energy levels and personal presentation; however, being somewhat reserved keeps me from fully embracing its appeal.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Scored as 3* (Neutral/Disagree slightly)
   - Although I understand the product's purpose, it feels a bit overreaching in making health claims without supporting details, thus lacking complete credibility for my cautious mind.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Scored as 2* (Strongly Disagree)
   - The focus on physical appearance might resonate less with someone who values unselfishness and emotional stability like me; it feels more superficial than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Scored as 3* (Neutral/Disagree slightly)
   - Though I recognize the benefits, my tendency towards careful decision-making and general skepticism make me hesitate on immediate purchase intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Scored as 3* (Neutral/Agree slightly)
   - If paired with credible evidence or a compelling trial offer, I might be inclined to give it a go due to my thoroughness in trying new solutions for energy and appearance management.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Scored as 4* (Agree)
   - The ad prompts consideration; if the pricing aligns with my budget range of 36,000,000â€“45,000,000 VND and reviews are positive, I'm likely to seriously think about adding it to my routine.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively addresses a common issue (fatigue), its presentation needs more depth to fully convince me. My balanced personality leans toward cautious assessment but leaves room for thoughtful consideration and potential trial use if supported adequately.
