**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad (score = 6):** The energy and appearance benefits are appealing, particularly for someone in a demanding blue-collar job.
  - **Interesting (score = 5):** The promise of staying energized aligns with my daily needs but doesn't stand out as groundbreaking.
  - **Good (score = 4):** Itâ€™s reasonably well-crafted, but given my Neutral sociability and Agreed helpfulness to others, it could appeal more through community endorsements or peer recommendations.
  - **Attractive (score = 3):** The design is visually acceptable, though emotional stability isn't high, making the allure less compelling personally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 2):** While I appreciate its benefits, my Strongly Disagree with trusting advertisements means skepticism.
  - **Will try to buy this product (score = 3):** There's a cautious interest due to needing energy boosts but hesitation around authenticity and pricing within the budget range.
  - **Consider buying this product (score = 4):** I will give it some thought, especially if paired with reviews from colleagues or friends.

In summary, while the ad is somewhat appealing and beneficial, my trust issues and emotional stability concerns reduce overall enthusiasm. Practical consideration of peer endorsements might drive a purchase decision in future scenarios.
