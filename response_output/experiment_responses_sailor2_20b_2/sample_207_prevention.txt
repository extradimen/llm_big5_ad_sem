**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (4/7)**: The ad's message is somewhat appealing but lacks personal relevance.
- **I think the ad is interesting (3/7)**: It doesn't capture my attention significantly due to overused fatigue and dullness tropes.
- **I believe the ad is good (2/7)**: While it aims to address common issues, its execution feels generic.
- **I find the ad attractive (1/7)**: The imagery or tone isn’t engaging enough given my preferences.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (2/7)**: Not high; I need more convincing factors like brand reputation or personal experience with similar products.
- **I will try to buy this product (3/7)**: There’s a small inclination, but it's not strong enough due to the ad's lack of compelling evidence or unique value proposition.
- **I will consider buying this product (2/7)**: The ad puts me in a "think about it" state without triggering an immediate purchase urge.

Overall, while there are aspects that mildly interest me, my cautious nature and higher standards mean I wouldn't be easily swayed by such an advertisement alone. Additional information or reviews might increase consideration but not strong intent to buy right now.
