**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad:** Neutral (3). The ad's message is clear, but it doesn't excite or resonate strongly with me given my personality traits.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4). I find the concept of feeling tired and looking dull relatable, making the ad intriguing.
   - **Believe Itâ€™s Good:** Strongly Agree (5). The prevention-focused message is well-executed and aligns with common health concerns.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3). While not unappealing, it doesn't stand out enough for me to be highly drawn in.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree (2). Despite the compelling message, I am cautious and need more convincing before making a purchase decision.
   - **Try to Buy:** Agree (4). The ad prompts curiosity; I might give it a try based on its claims about fatigue relief.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5). Given my active lifestyle and potential for tiredness, the product aligns with my needs, making me seriously consider buying it.

Overall, while the advertisement is effective in grabbing attention and seems well-constructed, my purchase intention hinges more on trial experience rather than immediate action. The balance of skepticism from being "sometimes nervous" (Strongly Agree) keeps me cautious yet open to giving it a try.
