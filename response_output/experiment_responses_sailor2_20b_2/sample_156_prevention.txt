**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (2):**
   - Disagree: The assertive language feels overly dramatic and doesn't resonate well with my cautious nature.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3):**
   - Neutral-leaning towards Agree: It has a clear message, but it's not engaging enough to draw me in deeply.

3. **I believe the ad is good (4):**
   - Slightly Disagree: The claim about fatigue and dullness seems exaggerated; I'm skeptical of quick fixes without further evidence.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (2):**
   - Strongly Disagree: Lack of authenticity in fear-mongering tactics doesn't make it appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1):** 
   - Strongly Disagree: I'm not inclined to buy based on such a manipulative pitch.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (1):**
   - Strongly Disagree: No compelling reason or trust in the claim, making it unlikely for me to make an effort.

3. **I will consider buying this product (2):** 
   - Neutral but leaning towards Not Considered: While I'm open to new products if properly reviewed by others, current presentation isn't convincing enough to even think about purchasing right now.

In summary, the ad feels manipulative and lacks credibility for someone with my background and personality traits. Despite being moderately interesting, it does not inspire a purchase intention or attract me as an informed consumer.
