**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
  - I like the ad (score = 3): Neutral leaning towards a slight dislike due to my reserved nature and lack of interest in energetic or flashy advertisements.
  - I think it's interesting (score = 4): Somewhat agree; it captures attention but doesnâ€™t deeply engage me.
  - I believe the ad is good (score = 5): Generally neutral with a slightly positive inclination as claims about staying energized are reasonable, but not compelling enough for strong belief.
  - I find it attractive (score = 2): Strongly disagree; my reserved and emotionally stable nature doesn't resonate with overt promotional visuals.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intent to purchase (score = 1): Strongly disagree; despite the energy claims, personal health routines are well-established, making a new product less appealing.
  - Will try to buy (score = 2): Slightly agree but hesitant due to budget constraints and existing skepticism about quick fixes.
  - Consider buying (score = 3): Neutral agreement; might be open for consideration under specific circumstances (e.g., special offers or recommendations), but not an immediate decision.

Overall, while the ad makes a reasonable appeal, my reserved nature, practical outlook, and current lifestyle priorities don't align strongly with the product's promise. Thus, purchase intentions are low to moderate despite some neutral interest in its concept.
