**Detailed Evaluation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
1. **Like**: I find it somewhat appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance, but not strongly so. Score = **4/7**
2. **Interesting**: The message is clear and relevant for maintaining daily vitality, making it moderately interesting. Score = **5/7**
3. **Good**: While the ad communicates benefits effectively, it feels a bit generic without specific details or proof points to stand out. Score = **3/7**
4. **Attractive**: Visual appeal and promise of looking good do attract me, especially since I prioritize health and appearance. Score = **6/7**

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: While the ad's message resonates, additional information on product efficacy or personal experience would push my intent higher. Score = **2/7**
2. **Try to Buy**: Given my tendency towards thoroughness and originality, I'd be open to sampling it first (e.g., a free trial) before committing fully. Score = **4/7**
3. **Consider Buying**: The product aligns with lifestyle goals but needs stronger proof or reviews from trusted sources for me to seriously consider regular purchase. Score = **3/7**

In summary, while the ad makes positive impressions and is moderately attractive, my cautious approach requires more convincing evidence before making a definitive purchase decision.
