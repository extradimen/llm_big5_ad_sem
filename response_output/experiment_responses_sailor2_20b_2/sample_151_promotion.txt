**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
- **Like:** Neutral (4): The ad's appeal is average; it doesn't strongly resonate with my talkative nature or outgoing personality.
- **Interesting:** Disagree (3): As a blue-collar worker, I find more immediate relevance in tangible benefits rather than just being intrigued by appearance-centric claims.
- **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2): The focus on "looking your best" feels superficial and less aligned with my values of hard work and trustworthiness. Practicality is key for me.
- **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1): It lacks credibility in terms of how it aligns with a blue-collar lifestyle, making it unappealing.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **Intend to Purchase:** Agree (2): Although not strongly persuaded by the ad, I might still consider trying the product if there were reviews or endorsements from people within my trusted circles.
- **Try to Buy:** Disagree (3): The lack of a compelling connection means it won't be high on my priority list. Practical benefits must outweigh superficial promises for me to make an effort to buy.
- **Consider Buying:** Disagree (1): While not completely ruling out the possibility, I will only seriously consider buying if there is additional proof or recommendations reinforcing its effectiveness beyond just appearance.

In summary, while aspects of the ad may be acceptable at a neutral level, it falls short in compelling me due to perceived relevance and practicality. A more direct tie to energy boost related to daily work routines might improve both attitude and purchase intent for someone like myself.
