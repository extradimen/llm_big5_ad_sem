**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Score: 5)**: I find the ad somewhat engaging but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It captures attention adequately; there's an element of curiosity but could be more compelling.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: The message is clear and well-presented, with a positive focus on energy and appearance.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While not particularly attractive to me personally, it has some appeal given its target benefits.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: I am neutral leaning slightly negative; no strong desire based solely on the ad.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Low interest in making an effort to purchase after seeing this single advertisement.
   - **Consider Buying**: There's a slight consideration due to its functional benefits, but it’s not driving immediate action.

Overall, while I appreciate the well-rounded presentation of energy and health benefits, my relatively neutral personality combined with current financial constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) keep me from being highly motivated by this ad. The product's appeal is there but doesn’t resonate strongly enough for immediate action or a high purchase intent.
