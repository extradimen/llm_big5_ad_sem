**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**:  
   - **Like (score=3)**: While the concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing, I feel it’s overly simplified for my personal needs.
   - **Interesting (score=4)**: The idea has a certain level of intrigue but lacks specific details that would hook me more effectively.
   - **Good (score=5)**: It conveys positive benefits which align with general desires like energy and appearance, making it somewhat credible.
   - **Attractive (score=2)**: As someone who values authenticity over superficial promises, the generic nature doesn't strongly attract me.

2. **Purchase Intention**:  
   - **Intend to purchase (score=3)**: Though I appreciate its goals, my current priorities and budget might lean towards more basic needs.
   - **Try to buy (score=2)**: There’s low motivation without a compelling reason or special offer attached.
   - **Consider buying (score=4)**: If the product aligns with future energy-boosting or fitness plans, it could be considered for purchase eventually.

Overall, while I see value in maintaining health and appearance, my strong points on thoroughness and occasional rudeness indicate a preference for practicality over promotional hype. The ad is decent but not compelling enough to drive immediate action.
