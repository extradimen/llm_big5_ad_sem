**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like (3):** While not strongly positive, the ad's messaging appeals moderately because it aligns with my need for energy boost and looking good daily.
  - **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized is intriguing as a civil servant; however, its general appeal doesn't captivate me deeply due to moderate sociability levels.
  - **Good (5):** Neutral trust in the claim and some alignment with self-improvement goals make it seem reasonable but not exceptional.
  - **Attractive (2):** The overall attractiveness is low. As a somewhat reserved individual, I don't find the ad particularly engaging or persuasive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (4):** There's moderate intention due to personal health and appearance goals; however, it’s not a strong priority.
  - **Try (3):** Willingness to try is influenced by curiosity but cautious given my tendency towards thoroughness and avoiding careless decisions.
  - **Consider (4):** While I'll keep the option open based on active imagination and new idea tendencies, it won’t dominate immediate purchase plans.

Overall, while not highly persuasive, the ad resonates moderately with my values and lifestyle. The balanced scores reflect a mix of interest and cautious consideration rather than strong enthusiasm or commitment to purchasing immediately.
