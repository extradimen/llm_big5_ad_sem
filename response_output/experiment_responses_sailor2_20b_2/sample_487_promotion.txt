**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (Score = 3)**: While the ad is somewhat engaging due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personal preferences.
  - **Interesting (Score = 2)**: The concept isn’t particularly captivating given that similar claims are common in the market, making it less compelling.
  - **Good (Score = 4)**: It communicates value but lacks uniqueness or substantial evidence to consider it exceptional.
  - **Attractive (Score = 1)**: I find this ad unattractive as it feels too generic and over-promised without real appeal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: With a score of 2, my immediate intention is low. The lack of strong emotional connection or compelling evidence makes me cautious.
  - **Will Try**: Score = 3 indicates I might be open to trying it once but am not actively seeking out this product due to the weak ad impression.
  - **Consider Buying**: With a score of 4, there’s some level of consideration if reviews or personal recommendations come into play. It doesn't dismiss outright but isn’t enough on its own.

Overall, while acknowledging the potential benefits mentioned, my strong preference for credibility and genuine engagement keeps this advertisement from being persuasive in driving an immediate purchase decision. However, it does leave room for reconsideration under different circumstances.
