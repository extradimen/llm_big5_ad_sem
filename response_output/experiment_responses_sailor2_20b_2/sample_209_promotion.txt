**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: Neutral to slightly positive; it aligns with my preference for practical benefits, but lacks strong emotional appeal.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: I find energy drinks a relevant category due to balancing life commitments and studies. The promise of staying energized is interesting.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: Credible claims about boosting performance align with my commitment to doing thorough jobs, making it seem like a good product concept.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While functional benefits are appealing, the aesthetic and emotional attractiveness of the ad could be improved for me.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)**: Despite liking its practical value, Iâ€™m not immediately convinced enough to commit.
   - **Will try to buy (Score: 4)**: The neutral-to-positive attitude makes it worthy of a trial, especially considering the daily benefits.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 5)**: There's potential interest; given my strong agreement on thoroughness and following through with plans, I am likely to consider incorporating this product into my routine.

Overall, while not highly persuasive as an ad, its functional benefits resonate enough for a cautious consideration. The blend of practicality and personal attributes like reliability contributes positively but falls short of immediate purchase intent due to the lack of strong emotional connection or standout features.
