**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (5) - While it's not particularly disliked, my general tendencies toward being reserved and sometimes worrying about practicalities mean I don't have a strong positive reaction.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) - The promise of staying energized resonates with me, but other aspects may lack depth or excitement.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (6) - As someone who values thoroughness and a clear message, I appreciate its direct benefits for daily life and appearance enhancement.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (3) - The visual appeal might not be compelling enough to significantly influence my immediate engagement; it needs stronger creative elements.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Neutral with leaning towards disinterest)
   Despite agreeing on its benefit, other factors like cost and personal need outweigh the ad's effectiveness for me at this time.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   My financial constraints (monthly income range) make a purchase unlikely without compelling evidence of significant value or necessity.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 2 (Somewhat Neutral)
   While I might think about it, the overall lack of strong drive and current priorities mean that consideration remains low.

In summary, while finding parts of the ad appealing, practical considerations and personal characteristics make a purchase intention relatively weak. The advertisement succeeds in its message but fails to convert into immediate buying intent due to broader lifestyle factors and cautious nature.
