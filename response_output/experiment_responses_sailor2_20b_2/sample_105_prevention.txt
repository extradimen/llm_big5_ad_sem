3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral with Positive Tendency (Score: 5)
   - It conveys clear benefits, which aligns with my practical nature as a civil servant; however, it’s not exceptionally compelling to me personally.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - My reserved personality and emotional stability concerns mean I don't feel particularly drawn in by advertisements of this kind.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral with Consideration (Score: 3)
   - The advertisement's message is relevant, but my cautious nature means it doesn’t spur immediate intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat Positive (Score: 3)
   - If the drink seems reliable and budget-friendly within my income range of VND 26-35 million per month, I might give it a trial run.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Moderately Considered (Score: 4)
   - Given its potential benefits and reasonable price point, there’s enough interest to seriously weigh the purchase during future shopping decisions.

Overall, while not highly persuaded by the ad's messaging due to personal traits like being reserved and emotionally stable, I still find it worthy of consideration for practical reasons. Therefore, a balanced evaluation reflects moderate intent towards trying or buying it if circumstances align favorably.
