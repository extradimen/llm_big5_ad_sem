**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (1–7 Scale):**
  - **Like:** 5 – Neutral leaning towards positive. The slogan appeals but doesn't strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting:** 4 – Somewhat interesting; the promise of energy and looking good is basic, not groundbreaking for me personally.
  - **Good:** 5 – I believe it conveys a clear benefit (staying energized), which makes it an acceptable ad message.
  - **Attractive:** 6 – Visually appealing or engaging graphics could make this more attractive; the concept itself has some charm.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** 3 – Neutral with a slight incline. While I appreciate staying energized, it doesn't trigger immediate purchase intent.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** 2 – Low likelihood due to more priority on essential needs; might explore alternatives first.
  - **Consider Buying:** 4 – Will consider in the future if there’s need or better promotion since aligns with my values of thoroughness and planning.

Overall, while the ad presents a helpful product benefit, it falls short in compelling immediate action given my practical focus as a blue-collar worker. It's interesting but not decisive enough to drive an urgent purchase decision.
