**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - I like the ad (Score = 4): Neutral to slightly positive; it addresses common daily issues.
  - The ad is interesting (Score = 3): Mildly engaging but not particularly captivating.
  - It's good (Score = 4): Effective in conveying a problem that needs addressing, making it credible without being overly sensationalized.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score = 2): Not very appealing; lacks personal resonance or emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - Intent to purchase this product (Score = 5): The message is persuasive enough to consider trying, but not a strong guarantee of immediate action.
  - Will try to buy (Score = 4): Moderate likelihood due to the preventive benefit and overall quality perception implied by the ad.
  - Consider buying (Score = 6): High consideration; while I appreciate its utility, practicality influences my decision over emotional appeal.

Overall, this advertisement is functional and well-targeted but doesn't fully connect with me on a deeply personal or highly motivating level. It prompts thoughtful evaluation rather than instant impulse purchase.
