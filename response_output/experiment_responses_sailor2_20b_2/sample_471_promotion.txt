**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Scores):**
   - **Like:** Neutral leaning towards positive (scored as 3). The messaging appeals but does not strongly resonate due to my practical, results-oriented nature.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly above neutral (4) because it promises energy and appearance benefits, which are relevant for a civil servant's lifestyle.
   - **Good:** Moderate agreement (5), acknowledging that the ad’s claims align with maintaining productivity and self-image but lacks depth in how these goals are achieved.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral leaning negative (2). The generic nature of “staying energized” and "looking best" feels somewhat vague compared to my preference for detailed, credible information.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Mild consideration (3), as the product aligns with personal needs but requires further proof of efficacy.
   - **Try to Buy:** Similar level of intent (3) since I appreciate trying new solutions that might enhance daily performance, especially given my high workload and need for energy.
   - **Consider Buying:** Slightly higher (4) due to ongoing interest in maintaining physical appearance and productivity without jumping into a purchase just yet.

In summary, while the ad piques mild interest with its promises of energy and improved looks, it falls short on detailed credibility and emotional appeal. Hence, my attitude is moderately positive but cautious towards purchasing intent, leaning more toward considering rather than immediately acting upon this product.
