**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - *I like the ad (score of 5)*: As someone who is talkative and outgoing, I find engaging ads appealing; however, this one didn't strike a strong personal chord.
  - *Interesting (4)*: It’s an average rating. The concept resonates slightly but not enough to captivate me fully.
  - *Good (6)*: Given my helpful nature and desire for well-being, the idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing in theory. Thus, a higher score here.
  - *Attractive (3)*: The ad lacks strong visual or emotional hooks that align with my outgoing personality, making it less attractive.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend to purchase (2)*: Though the message resonates healthily, there isn't enough compelling reason given my current financial situation and other priorities.
  - *Try to buy (1)*: Given my monthly income range of VND 26M–35M, this product might seem more on the luxury side. Hence, I'm unlikely to proactively seek it out.
  - *Consider buying (3)*: There’s a mild interest; if offered during sales or with coupons, I may consider adding it as part of my routine.

Overall, while the message is aligned with healthy living goals and new idea generation traits, practicality and current financial constraints prevent stronger purchase intentions. Thus, an average to slightly positive evaluation for the ad but not enough motivation to make a definite buy decision.
