**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - I like the ad (Score: 2) — Neutral to mildly negative; given my tendency towards Agree with being reserved and sometimes rude, a generic energy drink claim isn't compelling.
    - It's interesting (Score: 3) — Mildly agree. The promise of staying energized can pique curiosity briefly but doesn’t strongly engage me due to personal experiences not aligning well.
    - I believe the ad is good (Score: 4) — Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it presents an appealing idea, though skepticism arises from my Disagree stance on general trust and Agree tendency for being careless with promises.
    - It's attractive (Score: 1) — Strongly disagree. My reserved nature coupled with a lack of emotional stability makes the ad seem superficial rather than genuinely attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3) — Neutral; while it has minimal appeal, my tight budget and low trust in such quick-fix claims prevent firm intention.
    - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2) — Slightly disagree. Given financial constraints (<15 million VND/month), trying the product isn't high priority despite curiosity.
    - I will consider buying it (Score: 2) — Neutral; while original ideas intrigue me, practical considerations like cost and personal needs weigh down any purchasing consideration.

In summary, though intrigued by its creativity, my cautious nature, limited income, and skepticism towards such ads result in overall low positive attitudes toward the ad and moderate to slightly negative purchase intentions.
