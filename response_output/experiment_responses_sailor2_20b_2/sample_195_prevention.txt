**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (Score = 3):** Although I find it somewhat appealing given its focus on preventing tiredness and dull appearance, my reserved nature means it doesn’t deeply resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (Score = 4):** The ad's messaging is clear about addressing fatigue, which appeals to practicality but could be more engaging in presentation.
   - **Good (Score = 2):** Neutral on quality since the prevention aspect aligns well for daily life, though it lacks strong emotional or imaginative hooks.
   - **Attractive (Score = 4):** Slightly attractive due to its potential benefits; however, my sociability and agreement with helpfulness make me appreciate straightforward problem-solving ads.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Despite some reservations about the ad's execution, I value thorough work and planning—meaning this product aligns well if it genuinely improves energy levels (score = 5).
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Given my strong agreement on following through with plans and being original in decision-making, trying a new solution for tiredness seems reasonable (score = 6). 
   - **Consider Buying:** The ad's messaging directly addresses common daily struggles. Considering the benefits it offers and aligning with my proactive nature, I am highly inclined to give it serious thought (score = 7).

Overall, while there’s room for improvement in how engagingly this message is presented, the practical appeal of preventing tiredness and improving appearance resonates well enough to encourage consideration and potential purchase.
