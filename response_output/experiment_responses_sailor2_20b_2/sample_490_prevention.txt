**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 6)** - I appreciate its direct approach to addressing fatigue and dullness.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - It piques curiosity but needs better creativity or storytelling.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - Functional, yet somewhat generic; lacks emotional depth.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Not visually or emotionally compelling enough for me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - While it’s effective in highlighting a problem, my current routine isn't lacking significantly, so no strong intent.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Low inclination due to limited personal urgency; I prefer thorough research before making such decisions.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1)** - Mild consideration only if my fatigue levels spike unexpectedly, but not a regular purchase item.

Overall, while the ad resonates somewhat with its clear message and relevance to daily life issues, it doesn’t drive strong personal engagement or immediate action due to my balanced lifestyle approach.
