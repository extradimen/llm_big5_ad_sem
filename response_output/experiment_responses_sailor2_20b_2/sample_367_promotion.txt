**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score: 4)**:
  - While I appreciate its energetic tone and visual appeal, it feels a bit generic. It resonates mildly but not strongly due to my daily focus on practicalities.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**:
  - The message is straightforward, which can be seen as boring for someone who seeks variety in content. However, it does grab attention briefly.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
  - It conveys a clear benefit ("staying energized and looking best"), but lacks depth that would make me fully trust or admire its claim without more evidence.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
  - As someone who values practicality over aesthetics, I don’t personally find it exceptionally visually appealing. It’s functional rather than captivating.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
  - Given my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month), the perceived premium nature of such a drink is out of budget.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
  - The desire for energy boost and looking good might entice me briefly, but practical considerations like cost efficiency prevail.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**:
  - There’s a consideration due to the promise of benefits. However, actual purchase is unlikely until I face specific need or affordability changes.

**Overall:** The advertisement aligns with my personality's emphasis on planning and trust but falls short in compelling me to buy given financial realities and moderate appeal. Thus, low-to-moderate scores reflect cautious interest without strong intent for immediate purchase.
