**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (4/7):** The ad has an appealing message, but as someone who tends to be emotionally stable and not overly imaginative, it's somewhat engaging yet doesn't create strong emotional attachment.
  - **Interesting (5/7):** It captures attention by focusing on energy and appearance—topics that resonate in daily life. However, the presentation might lack depth for a deeper interest.
  - **Good (3/7):** While the idea of staying energized is beneficial, my practical nature questions how effectively the product delivers such results based solely on an advertisement.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** The ad's visual and messaging appeal are moderate; as someone who appreciates thorough work but tends to be more reserved in excitement levels, it doesn't feel overly compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (1/7):** Without solid evidence or personal recommendation from peers, there isn’t a strong drive to purchase.
  - **Try (2/7):** There's mild curiosity due to the promise of looking and feeling good daily. However, my cautious nature hesitates to commit without more concrete reassurance.
  - **Consider (3/7):** Given financial constraints and practicality over hype, I am open but not actively inclined towards buying until additional information or a trusted review is available.

Overall, while the ad presents an appealing concept, it falls short in convincing me personally due to my reserved nature, need for credibility, and cautious approach. Thus, moderate interest without high purchasing intent.
