**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like**: Neutral (3) - I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good but am not overly enthusiastic.
2. **Interesting**: Slightly Agree (4) - The message is clear and straightforward, making it engaging to a degree.
3. **Good**: Agree (4) - It conveys benefits effectively; though not exceptional, it gets its point across well.
4. **Attractive**: Somewhat Attractive (5) - The promise of looking your best resonates with my practical side, but the messaging feels standard.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree (2) - While I appreciate the ad's message, personal circumstances and financial constraints make immediate purchase less likely.
2. **Try to Buy**: Neutral (3) - If offered at a favorable price or with good reviews, there might be interest in giving it a try.
3. **Consider Buying**: Agree (4) - Given my busy lifestyle, the idea of an energizing product could lead me to seriously consider adding it if I see positive outcomes from others.

Overall, while not strongly persuaded by the ad, I find it reasonably appealing and open to considering the product under appropriate conditions. The balance between practicality and skepticism reflects my cautious yet methodical approach.
