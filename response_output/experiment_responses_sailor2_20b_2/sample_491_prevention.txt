**Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad:** Neutral (Score = 3) - While I appreciate its attempt to highlight potential negative consequences without it, my reserved nature makes me indifferent.
  
2. **Interesting:** Agree (Score = 4) - The message is engaging and taps into common concerns about energy levels and appearance, making it somewhat interesting.

3. **Good Ad:** Disagree (Score = 2) - Lacks depth for someone who values thoroughness; the claim feels a bit over-simplified without concrete evidence or alternatives.
  
4. **Attractive:** Agree (Score = 5) - It’s moderately appealing due to its focus on well-being, which resonates with some of my concerns but not enough to strongly attract.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Mild Disagreement (Score = 2) - Despite the ad's impact, I don’t feel compelled without additional information or personal need.
   
2. **Try to Buy:** Neutral Tendency (Score = 3) - It’s on my mind but not urgent; might consider it if there are discounts or reviews supporting its effectiveness.

3. **Consider Buying:** Agree (Score = 4) - Given the high-stress nature of daily life and occasional concerns about energy, I'm open to giving it a try under suitable circumstances.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in raising awareness, my reserved, sometimes careless tendencies balance out an otherwise compelling message, leading to moderate interest without strong intent for immediate purchase.
