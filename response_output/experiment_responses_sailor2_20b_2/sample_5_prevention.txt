**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: It's engaging and uses a common concern of energy levels and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)**: The concept resonates, playing on feelings of tiredness and looking dull.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)**: While effective in presenting its claim, it's slightly over-promising without solid evidence or details I can relate to personally.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: The imagery and messaging could be more appealing given my reserved approach to strong claims.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**: Curiosity is there, but stronger commitment isnâ€™t yet formed.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Not immediate action; needs further persuasion or personal experience endorsement.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Open-mindedness towards considering it due to its relevance and potential benefits.

Overall, the ad successfully taps into common anxieties but falls short in compelling me fully with just one message without additional proof or relatable testimonials given my critical nature and skepticism of quick fixes. My social inclination might encourage trying new things, yet careful evaluation remains essential before making a purchase decision.
