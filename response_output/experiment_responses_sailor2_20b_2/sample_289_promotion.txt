**Evaluation Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **Like (2/7):** Given my reserved nature and preference for minimalism, the ad feels slightly overpromising.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The focus on staying energized resonates but lacks personal connection due to being neutral about "looking best."
   - **Good (4/7):** It conveys a positive message, suitable for someone who values energy and well-being. 
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Moderately appealing yet not strongly engaging considering my reserved personality.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend (5/7):** While the product sounds beneficial, I am cautiously optimistic rather than immediately inclined to buy.
   - **Try (6/7):** Curiosity is high enough to consider giving it a trial run based on its claimed benefits.
   - **Consider (5/7):** Despite minor reservations about overhyped ads, practical concerns around energy levels make me seriously contemplate purchasing.

Overall, the ad aligns moderately with my needs and values but does not compel an immediate purchase decision. The balanced approach of considering it further reflects a thoughtful consumer attitude consistent with someone who prefers methodical planning (Agree on "make plans") while being somewhat anxious about new products (Strongly Agree on "get nervous easily").
