**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Score 3)**: While not strongly positive, the ad's straightforward message about fatigue and appearance is somewhat appealing.
   - **Interesting (Score 4)**: The preventive focus on avoiding tiredness resonates slightly because of my concern for well-being.
   - **Good (Score 5)**: Itâ€™s effective in highlighting a common issue; thus, it feels relatively good but not exceptional.
   - **Attractive (Score 2)**: Personally reserved and sometimes anxious, I find the ad's urgency less attractive due to its potential to trigger my nervousness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score 3)**: Though it presents a valid concern, my general tendency toward being cautious means this wouldn't drive an immediate purchase.
   - **Try to Buy (Score 4)**: I might consider trying the product due to its promise of alleviating fatigue, but not strongly motivated.
   - **Consider Buying (Score 5)**: There is enough merit in the ad for me to keep it on my radar, especially if further reviews or endorsements align with my trust and helpful nature.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively communicates a relevant issue, its appeal is balanced by personal reservations, leading to moderate interest without an immediate buying impulse.
