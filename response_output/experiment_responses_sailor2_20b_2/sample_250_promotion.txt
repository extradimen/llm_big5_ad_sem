**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - Given my reserved nature and strong focus on practicality over excitement, I am somewhat neutral to a general promotion ad. It's not offensive but doesn't evoke personal enthusiasm.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Score = 4 (Agree)
   - The claim of staying energized and looking good resonates with common goals in modern life, making it moderately engaging for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Score = 5 (Strongly Agree)
   - Although not overly compelling due to my reserved personality, I see value in its straightforward messaging which aligns with maintaining health and appearance.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - The visual appeal or creative aspects of an advertisement don't strongly draw me; practical benefits are more important than aesthetics for someone like myself who prioritizes efficacy over allure.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - My generally trustful nature and the fact that staying energized is a common goal make it considerate, but I don't feel compelled enough by the ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Score = 3 (Agree)
   - The prospect of giving it a shot aligns with my cautious yet helpful attitude; willing to test if reviews or personal experience confirm its value.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Score = 4 (Strongly Agree)
   - Practical, well-executed products that support daily health and energy are within my consideration set, making the idea of purchasing it a strong possibility based on credible evidence or recommendations. 

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message, practical benefits must be validated through further research to drive actual purchase intent. Balance between neutrality in appreciation and active consideration for purchase is maintained with moderate scores reflecting this nuanced perspective.
