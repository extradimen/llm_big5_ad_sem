**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - Being reserved and sometimes rude to others leans me towards a neutral or slightly negative sentiment toward general promotions.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - An agreeable trait of having an active imagination makes it somewhat engaging, but not overwhelmingly so.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
   - Neutral in trusting and generally positive about well-presented claims; this score reflects a cautious optimism without strong conviction.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Given my reserved nature, I don't typically gravitate towards overly promotional or flashy content.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; despite being a student with an income range of 26-35 million VND per month, my reserved and careful nature makes me reluctant to commit without more evidence or familiarity.

2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Also strongly disagree due to the lack of trust in immediate promotional claims, combined with a tendency towards thoroughness which requires additional research before taking action.
   
3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral leaning toward negative; while my imagination and originality mean I acknowledge that staying energized is important, there isn't sufficient motivation or alignment with current priorities to seriously consider it now.

Overall, the ad's positive messaging about energy and appearance resonates mildly but not persuasively enough given my personality traits and practical concerns. Hence, low scores reflect a reserved skepticism rather than outright rejection.
