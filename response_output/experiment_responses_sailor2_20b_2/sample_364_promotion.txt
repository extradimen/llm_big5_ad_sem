**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate its effort to energize and enhance appearance, it doesn't resonate deeply due to my reserved nature.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The idea of staying energetic is appealing; however, my strong agreement with being thorough means more substantive details would make the ad even better.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: It conveys a positive message about health and appearance which aligns partially but lacks depth for a firm endorsement.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The general attractiveness is low because it feels somewhat generic. My reserved personality finds it less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 6)**: I'm inclined to buy the product due to its emphasis on daily well-being, despite a slight reservation about the advertisement itself.
   - **Will Try (Score: 7)**: Given my pragmatic approach and need for energy, trying it out seems logical—reflecting both self-improvement drive and thoroughness in evaluating new products.
   - **Consider Buying (Score: 5)**: A balanced score reflecting that while the ad itself is not captivating enough, personal needs make serious consideration worthwhile.

Overall, the product aligns with my wellness-oriented lifestyle but lacks a compelling presentation to fully captivate someone like me. Thus, moderate-to-high interest and intent drive the purchase intention scores despite reservations about the advertisement’s attractiveness.
