**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **I like the ad:**  
   - **Score: 3 (Neutral)**  
     The message about fatigue and dullness can be relatable but doesn't strongly evoke positive feelings due to being somewhat generic.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   - **Score: 4 (Agree)**  
     It piques mild curiosity because it addresses common concerns, though not exceptionally creative or engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   - **Score: 5 (Strongly Agree)**  
     The message of preventing tiredness and looking dull aligns with daily struggles, making it effective in its purpose.
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   - **Score: 2 (Disagree)**  
     While informative, the presentation lacks visual or emotional appeal to truly stand out.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   - **Score: 3 (Neutral)**  
     Although it resonates with my needs, other factors like price and personal preferences influence intent.
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   - **Score: 4 (Agree)**  
     Given the reasonable monthly income and societal pressure for energy drinks, a trial purchase seems plausible.
3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   - **Score: 3 (Neutral)**  
     While I acknowledge its benefits, it's not an immediate priority; further review or discounts might sway my decision.

Overall, while the ad is credible and effective in conveying its message, additional factors such as brand reputation and personal budget play into whether a purchase will actually happen.
