**Evaluation Details:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **Like the Ad (Score: 3) - Neutral:**  
   While I appreciate clear messaging about staying energized and looking good, it doesn't particularly excite me given my reserved nature.

2. **Interesting (Score: 4) - Slightly Agree:**  
   The promise of daily vitality is somewhat intriguing but not enough to captivate me strongly.

3. **Good Ad (Score: 5) - Neutral Tending Positive:**  
   It conveys a basic value proposition effectively, though it doesn't align closely with my priorities or lifestyle concerns at this stage in life and income level.

4. **Attractive (Score: 2) - Disagree:**  
   The ad's appeal is minimal; I find myself drawn more to practical necessities rather than energy drinks for appearance reasons.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1) - Strongly Disagree:**  
   Given my budget constraints and limited interest in lifestyle beverages, thereâ€™s no intent to buy this product.

2. **Will Try to Buy (Score: 2) - Slightly Disagree:**  
   Despite the low likelihood of purchasing outright, I might consider it if highly discounted or part of a practical need arises unexpectedly.

3. **Consider Buying (Score: 3) - Neutral Tending Negative:**  
   Though unlikely, there's slight openness to considering it under certain circumstances but not as an active priority in my current budget plan.

Overall, the ad is moderately engaging for its target audience but falls short of compelling me due to personal values and financial constraints. I appreciate clear communication yet prioritize more essential needs over this product.
