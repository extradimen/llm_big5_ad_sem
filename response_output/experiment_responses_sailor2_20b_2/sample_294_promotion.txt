**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (score=2):** While I appreciate some marketing efforts aimed at health and appearance, my personal preference leans more towards directness rather than overly energizing promises.
  
- **Interesting (score=3):** It sparks mild interest due to its focus on daily benefits, but lacks compelling detail for someone like me who values practicality over superficial claims.

- **Good (score=4):** Neutral-to-positive evaluation; the idea of staying energized is appealing in theory. However, given my skepticism and past experiences with similar products, I don't find it exceptionally credible or well-presented.

- **Attractive (score=3):** The visuals might be aesthetically pleasing, but overall attractiveness is tempered by personal reservations about trustworthiness and relevance to my lifestyle.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend (score=1):** Strongly disagree. Despite the benefits mentioned, I'm unlikely to purchase based on this ad aloneâ€”my decision-making process favors thorough research and reliability over promotional hype.
  
- **Try (score=1):** Similarly, trying the product isn't a high priority due to past experiences with ineffective or costly supplements.

- **Consider (score=2):** Mild consideration; if presented with additional credible information (such as reviews from trusted sources), I might reconsider. However, my default stance is cautious and skeptical without further evidence.

In summary, while there are slight positive inclinations towards the ad's message, its overall appeal falls short due to mistrust in marketing claims, personal preferences for direct effectiveness, and financial constraints. Thus, despite minor interest, a purchase intention remains low.
