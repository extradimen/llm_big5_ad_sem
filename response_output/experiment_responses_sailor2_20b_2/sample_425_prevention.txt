**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (ad_attitude_scores):**
  - **Like:** The neutral tone and strong reservations about being talkative or outgoing make me moderately inclined, scoring a `3`.
  - **Interesting:** Given my active imagination (`Agree`), it's somewhat interesting but not highly engaging, hence a `4`.
  - **Good:** Despite the perceived relevance to daily fatigue, I'm skeptical due to trust issues and lack of strong connection with sociable ads, rating it as `5`.
  - **Attractive:** The ad feels more informative than attractive, especially given my reserved nature, so a lower score of `2`.

- **Purchase Intention (purchase_intention_scores):**
  - **Intend:** With my cautious and careless tendencies (`Strongly Agree`), immediate intention to buy is low, scoring `1`.
  - **Try:** The neutral response toward rudeness implies I might be open enough to give it a try but cautiously, rated as `2`.
  - **Consider:** Due to emotional stability and active imagination, there's mild consideration for exploring the product, resulting in a `3`.

Overall, while moderately interested, my reserved nature and cautious approach lead to lower purchase intentions. The ad is effective at raising awareness of potential benefits but does not drive strong immediate action.
