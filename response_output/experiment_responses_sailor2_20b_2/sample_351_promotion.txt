**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad**: Since I am reserved and generally not talkative or outgoing, I don't find energetic slogans appealing strongly, leading to a score of 2.
2. **The ad is interesting**: Neutral due to my preference for straightforward information rather than flashy claims; thus, it doesnâ€™t stand out as intriguing (3).
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Agreeable because staying energized and looking best are plausible benefits people might appreciate, even though it may not emotionally resonate deeply with me (4).
4. **The ad is attractive** to me: Strongly disagree since my reserved nature doesn't align well with an energetic lifestyle pitch (1).

### Purchase Intention:
- Given the mixed feelings about the advertisement and practical considerations regarding necessity vs. personal appeal, I would likely:
  - **Intend to purchase**: Neutral leaning towards consideration due to its potential benefits but not strong enough to drive immediate action (3).
  - **Try to buy** or have a trial mindset: Similar reasoning, indicating cautious interest rather than outright enthusiasm (3).
  - **Consider buying in the future**: Balanced perspective with low-impulse influence and reserved nature leading me towards thoughtful consideration before making a decision (3).

Overall, while not dismissive of its claims entirely, my reserved disposition and focus on stability over hype result in moderate to low scores for engagement and purchase intention.
