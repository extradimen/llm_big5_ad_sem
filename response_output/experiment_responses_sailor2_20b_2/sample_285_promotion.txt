**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores (on a scale of 1-7):**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 3*  
   While I appreciate that the drink promises energy and appearance benefits, it doesn’t particularly grab my attention due to its generic nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 4*  
   It’s moderately engaging because of the dual focus on wellness (energy) and vanity (looking best), but lacks novelty for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 2*  
   The message feels somewhat clichéd, not standing out enough to be seen as genuinely persuasive or unique in my eyes.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 5*  
   It has a decent visual appeal and resonates at some level due to its common health/beauty themes, but isn’t compellingly different from others I’ve encountered.

### **Purchase Intention Scores (on a scale of 1-7):**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 1*  
   Despite the benefits mentioned, given my busy managerial job and concerns about numerous health/energy products in the market, intent is low without strong personal relevance or trust.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2*  
   Mild curiosity exists due to its claims but not enough motivation for an immediate purchase attempt; I might consider it as part of broader exploration rather than a priority.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3*  
   It's in the contemplation zone—enough interest to note and possibly try if reviews align with expectations, especially given my desire to look good while staying productive (aligning slightly with sociable traits).

In summary:
- The ad is moderately engaging but fails to excite strongly.
- Purchase intent remains low due to cautiousness, concerns about product efficacy, and a preference for more trustworthy endorsements. However, it keeps the option open for future consideration based on external validation or personal need.
