**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 4)**: While not strongly positive, I find it somewhat appealing because fatigue and a dull appearance are common concerns.
    - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: It sparks mild curiosity about how the drink might help but doesn't captivate me much.
    - **Good (Score: 2)**: The message is clear, though it feels generic; there's room for more compelling details or proof of efficacy.
    - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: It’s moderately attractive due to addressing daily struggles with energy levels and appearance, but lacks strong emotional engagement.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my financial constraints ($<15,000,000 VND per month), I prioritize essential expenses over potential supplements.
    - **Try (Score: 1)**: Also strongly disagree; there isn’t enough compelling evidence or trust in the brand to justify a trial purchase right now.
    - **Consider (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards consider. The idea may be noted for future consideration if my circumstances change, but immediate action is unlikely due to budget limitations and skepticism.

Overall, while I understand the ad’s appeal on some level, practical concerns and economic realities hinder a strong positive response or purchase intent at this time. Credibility and specific benefits would need further emphasis to sway me significantly.
