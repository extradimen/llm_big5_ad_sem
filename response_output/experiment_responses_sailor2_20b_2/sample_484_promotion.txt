**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - Given my reserved nature and not being strongly talkative or outwardly enthusiastic, I might appreciate its clean message but it doesn't excite me deeply.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - The concept of staying energized resonates with a blue-collar worker's day-to-day challenges, making it moderately engaging.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
   - Simple claims about energy and appearance can be perceived as beneficial for practical reasons without being overly flashy or unrealistic.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - My more reserved nature means I’m not drawn to highly polished, visually aggressive ads; a simpler presentation would better suit my tastes.
   
### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1) - Strongly Disagree**:
   - Despite its appealing claims, my monthly income is limited (<15,000,000 VND), and I prioritize essential needs over non-essential luxury drinks.

2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - The moderate interest in staying energized might lead me to consider a trial purchase if priced reasonably or during sales periods, but it's not an automatic commitment.

3. **Consider buying the product (Score: 3)**:
   - Given my generally trusting nature and practical outlook, I'm open to giving it a chance based on personal experience rather than just ad promises—so consideration is reasonable without strong intent.
   
**Overall**: While the advertisement presents an attractive message that resonates with certain needs, financial constraints and reserved preferences lead me to be cautious about immediate purchase intentions. However, openness to trying suggests potential future interest under suitable circumstances.
