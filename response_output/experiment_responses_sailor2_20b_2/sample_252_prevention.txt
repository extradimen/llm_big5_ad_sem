2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - It conveys a relevant concern, making it mildly engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - Logically effective in addressing fatigue and appearance issues; credible messaging.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - While not visually striking or emotionally compelling, it's acceptable.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - The appeal is there, but other factors like budget and current alternatives weigh in.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Mild inclination due to its potential benefits; might be influenced by promotions or reviews.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - The ad triggers consideration, but further deliberation is needed before committing.
