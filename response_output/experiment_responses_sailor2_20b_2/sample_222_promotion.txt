**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (3):* Neutral to slightly positive; I don't find it particularly engaging but not offensive.
   - *Interesting (4):* The promise of staying energized is mildly interesting due to my work demands, yet general.
   - *Good (5):* It has a clear benefit statement, which aligns with needing daily energy support; hence slightly more favorable than neutral.
   - *Attractive (2):* My reserved nature and lack of high emotional appeal make it less visually or emotionally attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase (3):* Moderate inclination due to the functional benefit but no strong personal resonance.
   - *Will try to buy (3):* Openness to giving it a try, especially considering work-related stress and general health concerns.
   - *Consider buying (4):* The ad warrants consideration given its claims fit into my busy lifestyle, though not compelling enough for immediate action.

The balance of practical need versus personal appeal results in moderately favorable but cautious scores. Despite strong agreement on thoroughness and planning, the overall presentation needs to better align with my reserved yet trusting nature for higher engagement levels.
