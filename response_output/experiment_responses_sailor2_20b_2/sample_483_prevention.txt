**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 3):** While somewhat agreeable due to its straightforward messaging, it doesn't resonate deeply. The talkative and slightly imaginative nature finds the message okay but not captivating.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** Neutral-positive; the connection between fatigue and appearance is clear enough for interest without being overly engaging.
   - **Good (score = 5):** It effectively communicates its point, making it a reasonably good ad in terms of messaging clarity.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** Lacks strong visual or emotional appeal. As an office worker with high stress levels and sometimes nervousness, I find the straightforward warning somewhat unattractive compared to more inspiring ads.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score = 4):** Neutral leaning towards slight intent due to my generally trusting nature; however, it needs additional reassurance.
   - **Try to buy (score = 6):** Higher inclination because I value trying out products that might alleviate tiredness and improve appearance despite reservations about daily effort required for thorough jobs or perfectionism.
   - **Consider buying (score = 7):** Strong consideration given my helpful nature, active imagination leading me to believe in potential benefits, and the idea of innovation appealing to try something new.

Overall, while I have a balanced view on its effectiveness and attractiveness, there's significant intent to explore further due to personal values like trustworthiness and openness to innovative solutions.
