**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitudinal Response:**
   - *I like the ad (Score: 3)*: While it’s engaging and somewhat intriguing due to its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance, my talkative nature doesn't find it overly appealing.
   - *The ad is interesting (Score: 4)*: It piques curiosity because I generally make thorough evaluations, but it's not captivating enough given my active mindset outside work hours.
   - *I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)*: The claim feels somewhat generic; a stronger focus on specific benefits would be more convincing for me as an informed consumer. 
   - *The ad is attractive (Score: 5)*: Despite reservations, the concept appeals due to my tendency towards planning and efficiency—being alert and looking fresh is important.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)*: Although I appreciate being proactive about wellness, past experiences with health products haven’t always been positive. My strong agreement on thoroughness means high expectations.
   - *I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)*: The ad nudges a trial but doesn't compel an immediate purchase given my cautious nature regarding new consumables.
   - *I will consider buying the product (Score: 4)*: My tendency towards making plans and following through with them makes me open to evaluating it further, especially if backed by reviews or scientific evidence.

Overall, while there’s a moderate positive inclination toward the ad's message due to practical relevance and planning mindset, concrete assurances about quality and effectiveness are necessary for a stronger purchase intention.
