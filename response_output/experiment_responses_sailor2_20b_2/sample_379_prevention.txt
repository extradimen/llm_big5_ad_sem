**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like:* Neutral (3): The ad's message resonates with me, but it doesn't evoke strong positive feelings right away.
   - *Interesting:* Agree (4): It’s engaging enough to capture my attention without being overly flashy or gimmicky.
   - *Good:* Strongly Agree (5): I appreciate the straightforward and somewhat persuasive nature of the ad. The link between feeling tired, looking dull, and needing this drink is compelling.
   - *Attractive:* Agree (6): Despite reservations about some aspects, the visual appeal and clear benefits make it appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Disagree (2): Although convinced of its value, my current financial situation (<15 million VND/month) makes a purchase unlikely.
   - *Try to Buy:* Neutral (3): I might consider trying the product if it’s affordable and available at convenient places but no immediate action is planned.
   - *Consider Buying:* Agree (4): Given my need for energy, I'll definitely keep this option in mind when budget allows or there are discounts/promotions.

Overall, while I find the ad effective, practical constraints temper my purchasing intent. It successfully communicates value and persuasiveness but falls short on immediate action due to financial limitations.
