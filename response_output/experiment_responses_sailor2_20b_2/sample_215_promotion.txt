**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: Neutral leaning towards positive; I appreciate it but not overly enthusiastic.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: Finds elements of interest, especially in its promise to energize and improve appearance daily.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**: Believe it conveys value effectively, aligning with personal goals of being energetic and looking good.
   - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: Generally appealing but not overwhelmingly attractive; focuses on core benefits without strong emotional resonance.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**: Neutral, leaning slightly towards no immediate intent due to budget constraints and existing alternatives.
   - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 3)**: Slightly open to trying if the need for energy boost or appearance enhancement becomes significant.
   - **Consider buying the product (Score: 3)**: Will keep it in mind, especially during times when I feel low on energy.

In summary, while the advertisement resonates with my values of being productive and maintaining personal presentation, budgetary concerns and moderate skepticism about daily purchase intentions slightly temper a full endorsement. The ad is perceived as good but not compelling enough to drive an immediate or frequent purchase decision.
