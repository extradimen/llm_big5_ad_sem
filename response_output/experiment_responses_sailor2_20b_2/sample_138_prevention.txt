**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3):** The ad message resonates neutrally; it seems factual but not particularly engaging for someone who values thoroughness over excitement.
   - **Interesting (4):** Agree, as it targets a common experience—feeling tired and looking dull—which is relatable.
   - **Good (5):** Strongly agree because the prevention aspect aligns with my preference for reliable solutions to daily issues. 
   - **Attractive (2):** Disagree; while informative, the ad lacks personal or emotional appeal given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3):** Neutral leaning towards agree because though I find it useful, immediate intent isn't high.
   - **Try (4):** Agree to try it, particularly if others in similar roles endorse the product and its efficacy is verified.
   - **Consider (5):** Strongly consider due to my generally trusting nature. The ad's credibility combined with potential benefits makes me open to giving it a shot.

Overall, while I appreciate the message’s reliability and relevance, an engaging presentation could enhance attraction levels. Nonetheless, purchase intent remains positive based on its practical value for managing daily fatigue and appearance concerns.
