**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **Like (score = 3):**
   - I find it somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so given my neutral-to-negative traits such as being sometimes rude and lacking thoroughness.

2. **Interesting (score = 4):**
   - The promise of staying energized is intriguing, especially in a busy managerial role. However, the slight negativity from some personal characteristics slightly lowers this score.

3. **Good (score = 5):**
   - Neutral on trust but generally positive about improving appearance and energy, making it seem beneficial even if not fully persuasive.

4. **Attractive (score = 4):**
   - While I appreciate its attractiveness as an individual who values looking good, the overall delivery doesn't strongly resonate with my personal preferences or traits.

### Purchase Intention

1. **Intend to purchase (score = 2):** 
   - The ad is not compelling enough due to my tendency toward careful decision-making and sometimes being careless; I wouldnâ€™t commit without more research or a trial.

2. **Try to buy (score = 1):**
   - Given the negative aspects in personal traits like rudeness, there's little motivation for me to go out of my way to test this product immediately.

3. **Consider buying (score = 2):** 
   - I am open to considering it later if others vouch or if circumstances align better with my needs. The active imagination helps ponder the possibilities without full commitment right now.

Overall, while there's a modest appreciation for the ad and its benefits, personal traits make the actual purchase intention cautious rather than enthusiastic.
