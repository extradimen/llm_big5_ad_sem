**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitudinal Response:**
   - **Like (5/7):** While not strongly positive, the ad resonates somewhat because of its directness in highlighting potential consequences without it.
   - **Interesting (6/7):** The message is compelling as it taps into common experiences like fatigue and appearance concerns, making it intriguing to a busy blue-collar worker.
   - **Good (4/7):** The claim has some merit but lacks depth or specific evidence to fully convince me; it feels somewhat generic.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Despite strong agreement in sociability and talkativeness, the advertisement's execution does not strongly appeal visually nor emotionally due to its basic messaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** The lack of detailed information on product benefits or personal relevance makes me less inclined to act immediately.
   - **Try (4/7):** There is mild curiosity, enough for a trial considering my stress and energy levels but not strong motivation alone.
   - **Consider (3/7):** I will keep the option open due to the emotional vulnerability around fatigue; however, other factors like price, brand trust, and reviews would heavily influence any final decision.

Overall, while the ad sparks interest, it doesn't sufficiently drive a high purchase intent primarily because of its lackluster appeal and insufficient product differentiation. Additional details or strong testimonials could enhance these scores significantly.
