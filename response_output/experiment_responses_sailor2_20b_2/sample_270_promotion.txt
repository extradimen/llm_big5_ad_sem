**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - Neutral but slightly positive; I appreciate its intention.
2. **It's interesting:** (Score: 4) - Agreeable to a degree; the idea of staying energized is appealing.
3. **The ad is good:** (Score: 5) - Slightly agree; it conveys benefits clearly, though somewhat generic.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - Disagree; while not unattractive, it lacks personal relevance and fails to strongly connect with my values or daily life.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 3) - Neutral but leaning towards cautious interest; the claim resonates marginally.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3) - Slightly agree; might consider giving it a shot if contextually aligned with my health regimen or when offered at an attractive price.
3. **Consider buying this product:** (Score: 4) - Agreeable; open-minded and willing to evaluate based on further information, reviews, and perhaps convenience for my lifestyle.

Overall, while the ad is decently structured, it falls short of compelling me due to its generic nature and lack of personalized appealâ€”especially with my strong preference for practicality over flashy claims. I maintain a balanced, pragmatic stance but remain open to exploring if aligns better with specific needs or values in daily routine.
