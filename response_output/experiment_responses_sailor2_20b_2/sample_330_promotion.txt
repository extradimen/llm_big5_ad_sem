**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad (`score = 3`): Given my reserved and non-talkative nature, ads that emphasize energy drinks may not be particularly appealing.
  - I think the ad is interesting (`score = 4`): Neutral to slightly agreeable; it's a common theme in fast-paced lifestyles but doesn't strongly grab attention.
  - I believe the ad is good (`score = 2`): Slightly disagree, as staying energized seems overplayed and not uniquely persuasive for my demographic (blue-collar worker with specific concerns).
  - I find the ad attractive (`score = 5`): Moderate agreement; it’s visually appealing but doesn’t deeply resonate due to personal traits.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intent to purchase this product (`score = 1`): Strongly disagree. While health and appearance are important, my routine and financial constraints make regular premium energy drinks less of a priority.
  - Will try to buy this product (`score = 2`): Slightly agree; might consider it during occasional moments when cost isn't the main constraint but remains unlikely overall.
  - Consider buying this product (`score = 3`): Moderate consideration; there's minimal incentive given my reserved and practical outlook, though not entirely ruled out for exceptional situations.

Overall, while acknowledging its visual appeal and some potential benefits, my conservative mindset, financial limitations, and lack of strong interest in social or personal enhancement make the ad less effective at driving purchase intent.
