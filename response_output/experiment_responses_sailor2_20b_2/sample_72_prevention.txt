**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: The straightforward and somewhat exaggerated tone feels slightly manipulative, so it doesn't resonate strongly.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's mildly engaging due to addressing common concerns about energy levels and appearance but lacks novelty for me.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: While not perfect, the ad effectively targets a relatable issue. However, its messaging is somewhat generic.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The visual appeal or creativity isn't high enough to draw significant interest.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**: Although the message connects with my desire for energy and appearance, I'm not convinced solely by the ad.
   - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: The low score reflects hesitation; other factors like brand reputation or personal experience would influence a trial purchase.
   - **Will consider buying this product (Score: 4)**: It's worth considering, especially if endorsed by trusted sources or has positive reviews. My preference for thoroughness and reliability is balanced here.

Overall, while the ad does not strongly persuade me, it prompts a moderate level of consideration based on my values and lifestyle concerns.
