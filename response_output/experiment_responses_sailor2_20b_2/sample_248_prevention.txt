**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4): While I appreciate its attempt to highlight a common issue with fatigue and appearance, it feels somewhat generic.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 5): It does spark curiosity about managing daily energy levels.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 3): The message seems credible but lacks depth or personal relevance in its presentation.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2): Its design and visual appeal are average; it doesn't strongly engage me.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1): Despite my concerns about fatigue, I'm not convinced enough by the ad alone.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 2): There's a mild interest driven by the need for energy boost but no strong commitment yet.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 3): It remains on my radar, but more information or personal recommendation would be needed before making an actual purchase.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventive value against fatigue and dullness, the ad falls short in compelling me to take immediate action. The balanced critical evaluation reflects a cautious yet open attitude toward considering the product.
