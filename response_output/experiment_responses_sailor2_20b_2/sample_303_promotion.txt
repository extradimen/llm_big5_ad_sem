**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **Like the Ad (Score: 2)** - As a reserved and somewhat introverted individual, I find it hard to connect with promotional ads that feel over-energetic or superficial.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - The promise of energy and looking good is appealing in theory but feels too generic; not particularly engaging for me.
3. **Good (Score: 4)** - It ticks the box functionally, promoting benefits everyone can appreciate, though it's neither exceptional nor persuasive to me personally.
4. **Attractive (Score: 1)** - Given my reserved nature and lack of interest in flashy marketing, I find this ad unattractive.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)** - While the benefits are useful, they don't drive me to make a purchase decision.
2. **Try to Buy (Score: 3)** - If it's available and affordable, I might give it a try due to its potential functional advantages but without strong enthusiasm.
3. **Consider Buying (Score: 2)** - The low score reflects that even after considering the product, my inclination remains neutral or slightly below average.

Overall, while acknowledging the value proposition of staying energized and looking good, this ad doesn't resonate deeply with my personality traits and thus has a limited impact on my purchase intention.
