**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - Being somewhat reserved and prone to worry means I find it neutral but not particularly appealing.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - The idea of preventing tiredness and looking dull holds a basic level of intrigue, though it doesn't captivate me strongly.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - On balance, the message seems logical but not compelling enough to convince completely.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - The visual or emotional appeal remains moderate; I'm not drawn in emotionally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my tendency toward carelessness and lack of thorough planning, immediate intent is low.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Some curiosity might lead me to consider it but without strong motivation.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - I acknowledge the potential usefulness; thus, there's a slight consideration despite my generally cautious nature.

In summary, while acknowledging its relevance and basic appeal, my critical outlook, combined with practical inclinations, results in moderate interest but minimal purchase intent.
