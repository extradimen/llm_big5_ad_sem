**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: While the ad’s messaging is clear and straightforward, my generally reserved nature means I don't find it overly engaging.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The concept of feeling tired without the product does resonate with everyday experiences but doesn’t excite me intensely.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: As a strong believer in thoroughness and quality, I acknowledge the ad is well-structured and informative. It effectively communicates its benefits.
   - **Attractive (Score: 4)**: Despite being sociable, it’s not enough to make me find the ad visually or emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score: 2)**: I'm neutral leaning towards disinterest; while acknowledging its potential benefits, personal habits and budget considerations don't push strong intent.
   - **Try (Score: 2)**: There's a small inclination to give it a try due to the ad’s rational appeal but not enough for immediate action. 
   - **Consider (Score: 3)**: I am open to considering this product if the opportunity arises, given its alignment with maintaining energy and appearance.

Overall, though the advertisement conveys useful information and benefits effectively, my reserved and practical nature doesn't lead to a strong purchase intention at present. The scores reflect a balanced view that is cautious yet not dismissive.
