**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards slight dislike. As a reserved and sometimes rude individual who values practicality over charm, I find the catch-all appeal of "energized" and "look your best" less compelling.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: Somewhat agreeable but not highly engaging. The promise feels generic rather than unique or surprising to me.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: Neutral leaning slightly positive. It conveys a clear message, though it doesn’t resonate deeply with my personality traits and lifestyle needs.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: Strongly disagree. The visual appeal or emotional connection isn't there for me; I prefer focused, informative messaging over glossy promotions.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my budget constraints (<15 million VND) and preference for practical products with proven value, the ad doesn’t persuade me enough.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree again. The cost-effectiveness isn't evident from the advertisement alone, which makes it a non-priority item in my current situation.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning towards consideration but with reservations. Although I appreciate being healthy and energetic, affordability and specific benefits need to be more compelling for me to seriously consider purchasing.

Overall, while the ad is adequately constructed, it lacks personal relevance and practical justification in my context, leading to a low purchase intention despite some neutral appeal. Practicality and budget constraints heavily influence this decision-making process.
