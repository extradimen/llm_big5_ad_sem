**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score = 2)  
     Despite being older and somewhat reserved, the claim of potential tiredness and dull appearance might seem relevant but not sufficiently appealing to evoke a strong liking.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral/Disagree (Score = 3)  
     The statement seems factual rather than captivating or engaging for my personality traits.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (Score = 4)  
     It conveys a clear benefit, which aligns with valuing thoroughness and practicality. However, it’s not highly convincing due to perceived overgeneralization.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2)  
     The focus on physical appearance doesn't resonate strongly given my reserved nature and limited concern about external presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Somewhat Agree (Score = 5)  
     Although I appreciate the potential benefits, my tendency towards carelessness might delay a solid intention.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Likely Try (Score = 6)  
     The persuasive nature of preventing tiredness and dull appearance nudges me toward giving it a chance despite not being fully convinced.
   - **I will consider buying this product:** Considered Purchase (Score = 4)  
     Given my worries, I am open to considering the product but won’t act impulsively due to trust issues.

Overall, while recognizing its potential value, aspects of personality and lifestyle lead to moderate interest rather than immediate or strong intent. The ad is deemed good enough for contemplation without a strong emotional pull.
