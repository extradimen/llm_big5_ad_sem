**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (3):** Neutral to slightly positive; it's appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting (4):** I find aspects intriguing due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, making it engaging enough to hold my attention briefly.
   - **Good (5):** The message is clear about staying energized and looking good, which resonates with daily routines. It's a well-crafted claim but not entirely convincing.
   - **Attractive (6):** The visual appeal likely plays a part in making the ad attractive; I find it visually pleasing.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2):** Strongly Disagree/Neutral, as my current high monthly income doesn't necessitate additional expenses for energy drinks immediately.
   - **Try to buy this product (3):** Slightly Agree; curiosity might lead me to test the drink once or twice but not regularly.
   - **Consider buying this product (4):** Neutral to slightly Agree. The concept is appealing, and I may think about purchasing it if there's a specific need for enhanced energy during hectic days.

Overall, while finding some aspects of the ad attractive and interesting, my current situation and preferences lean more towards cautious consideration rather than immediate or frequent purchases.
