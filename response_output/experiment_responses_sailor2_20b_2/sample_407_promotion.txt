**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (2):** Despite being talkative and reserved, the message of staying energized appeals but lacks excitement for me.
   - **Interesting (3):** Neutral; it covers a common need, but doesn't capture my attention uniquely.
   - **Good (4):** Agree that it presents positive benefits suitable for daily life, though not compelling enough to stand out strongly.
   - **Attractive (1):** Strongly disagree; the ad feels overly generic and lacks relatability given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2):** Minimal intent due to skepticism about its real effectiveness for someone like me who values thoroughness over hype.
   - **Try (3):** Somewhat open-minded; willing to give it a shot if others' experiences are positive, aligning with my helpful and agreeable nature but not strongly inclined.
   - **Consider (5):** Will definitely consider buying since the product promises tangible benefits like energy and looking good, which can be useful despite personal reservedness.

In summary, while I appreciate its message's intent, it falls short of inspiring a strong emotional connection or immediate purchase due to my reserved personality and moderate income considerations. Thus, the scores reflect cautious interest with room for reconsideration based on practical outcomes.
