**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **Like (2)**: The ad's message feels a bit generic and doesn't align well with my personality traits, so I don’t find it particularly appealing.
- **Interesting (3)**: It's somewhat attention-grabbing in its straightforward approach but lacks novelty for me. 
- **Good (4)**: Neutral to slightly positive; the claim about feeling tired and looking dull is plausible, making it decently persuasive from a factual standpoint.
- **Attractive (3)**: Not visually or emotionally engaging enough given my tendencies towards strong agreement on carelessness and rudeness, so I find the ad moderately attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (1)**: Despite recognizing its potential benefits, it doesn’t resonate strongly with me. Hence, no immediate intention.
- **Try (2)**: The idea is slightly intriguing but not compelling enough for a trial buy.
- **Consider buying (3)**: Given my neutral trust and tendency towards originality, I might think about the product if other factors align better during future considerations.

Overall, while acknowledging its effectiveness in addressing common issues, this ad falls short due to personal preferences leaning more toward unique experiences over straightforward health reminders. Thus, it receives moderate scores without strong inclination for purchase intent.
