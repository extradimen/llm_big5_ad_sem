**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**: 
   - **Like (3)**: The ad's message is clear but doesn't evoke strong personal interest.
   - **Interesting (4)**: While it's straightforward and to the point, it lacks novelty or emotional appeal for me.
   - **Good (5)**: It effectively communicates its purpose regarding energy levels and appearance, making it a decent advertisement.
   - **Attractive (2)**: The overall presentation is average; not visually compelling enough given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend to Purchase (3)**: Despite the message being logical, I'm cautious about new products due to worries and lack of thoroughness in trying them out.
   - **Try to Buy (4)**: There is a slight inclination to give it a try based on its claims but not strong enough to act immediately.
   - **Consider Buying (6)**: It's definitely something that I would consider for regular use, especially considering my tendency towards self-improvement and wellness.

In summary, while the ad resonates at a neutral-to-positive level due to its clear benefits, my reserved nature and inherent skepticism make me cautious about immediate purchase intent. However, it does pique curiosity enough for consideration as part of future purchases.
