**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **I like the ad**: I find it moderately appealing (Score = 3) due to my strong preference for outgoing and social activities but feel indifferent towards typical energy drink promotions.
   - **Interesting**: The promise of staying energized is intriguing, especially considering modern life's demands. It holds moderate interest (Score = 5).
   - **Believe the ad is good**: While not strongly convinced, I appreciate its focus on personal well-being and appearance which aligns with general wellness interests. Score = 4.
   - **Attractive**: The overall concept resonates well enough to be considered visually and emotionally attractive for someone seeking daily energy (Score = 6).

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend to purchase this product**: My strong agreement towards planning and following through suggests consideration but not immediate commitment due to other priorities (Score = 2).
   - **Try to buy the product**: With a mix of skepticism about trust in such claims, I am open to trying it once satisfied with my current energy solutions (Score = 3).
   - **Consider buying the product**: Given its appeal and potential benefits, along with my creative mindset towards new ideas, I will definitely keep this option on my radar for future purchase consideration (Score = 5).

Overall, while the ad is moderately compelling due to its focus on vitality and appearance, personal habits and existing routines mean it doesn't drive immediate action but warrants thoughtful evaluation.
