**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 3)**: As someone who is outgoing but not overly talkative and values social connections, I find some appeal in the idea of looking best to present a polished image socially.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**: The promise of staying energized aligns with my tendency for practicality, making it moderately engaging.
   - **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)**: It conveys positive attributes like energy and appearance enhancement, which can be beneficial to manage stress despite my nervousness, though I'm cautious about its credibility due to my strong distrust instinct.
   - **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)**: The appeal is limited because I am not naturally drawn towards flashy marketing; instead, effectiveness matters more.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (score = 4)**: While interested in its benefits, my cautious nature and tendency for thoroughness make me hesitant without concrete proof of efficacy.
   - **I will try to buy this product (score = 3)**: Open to giving it a shot if it's reasonably priced and comes with good reviews or endorsements from trusted sources.
   - **I will consider buying this product (score = 4)**: The idea holds merit, but I need further reassurance that it matches my expectations regarding performance and safety.

Overall, there is moderate interest influenced by the adâ€™s message of functionality and self-presentation, yet my cautious nature and specific personality traits keep purchase intent balanced rather than fully convinced.
