**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (Pre-ad Reaction):**
   - *I like the ad:* Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable, as it resonates with potential health concerns but feels somewhat generic. Score of **4**.
   - *I think the ad is interesting:* Marginally interesting due to relevant claims about energy and appearance; however, not particularly engaging. Score of **3**.
   - *I believe the ad is good:* Questionable credibility regarding exaggerated tiredness and dull look without concrete evidence or brand trust. Score of **2**.
   - *I find the ad attractive:* Somewhat visually appealing but lacks a compelling hook considering my reserved nature and preference for less emotional marketing. Score of **5**.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (Post-ad Reaction):**
   - *I intend to purchase this product:* Strongly disagree, as it doesn't align with past behavior or trust in health beverages without thorough research. Score of **1**.
   - *I will try to buy this product:* Slightly agreeable; might consider a small test purchase if convenient and price reasonable but not a strong commitment. Score of **2**.
   - *I will consider buying this product:* Mildly positive, acknowledging the potential benefits while being cautious given past experiences and financial constraints (16-25M VND/month). Score of **3**.

This evaluation balances my reserved nature, skepticism towards health claims without concrete proof, and moderate openness to considering healthier alternatives under specific conditions. The ad is intriguing but falls short in convincing immediate action or high trust from me.
