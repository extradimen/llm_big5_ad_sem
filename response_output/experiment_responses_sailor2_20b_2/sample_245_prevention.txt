**Evaluation Breakdown:**

- **Ad Attitude:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral. The message is clear, but it doesn't resonate deeply due to my generally reserved nature and tendency towards practicality over emotional engagement.
  - **Interesting:** Agree. It plays on common experiences of tiredness and appearance, making it relatable for an office worker like me.
  - **Good Ad:** Disagree. While the ad is effective in highlighting potential negative outcomes without the product, its claims feel somewhat exaggerated given my skeptical mindset (Disagree with trusting advertisements).
  - **Attractive:** Disagree. The appeal isn't strong enough to overcome personal tendencies toward being reserved and cautious about marketing promises.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend:** Neutral. Despite recognizing the potential benefits, I am not compelled by just seeing an ad; practical consideration will drive a decision.
  - **Try:** Agree. Since it addresses real concerns (tiredness, appearance), I'm inclined to give it a try once my regular routine allows for such experimentation.
  - **Consider:** Strongly Agree. The product fits within budget and could solve daily issues, making me seriously consider adding it to my purchase list.

In summary, the ad is seen as interesting but not overly persuasive due to personal skepticism and reserved nature. However, there's a strong willingness to at least give it a try and potentially include it in future purchases based on its practical benefits for an office worker.
