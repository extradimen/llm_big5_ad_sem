**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**:  
  1. I like the ad (Score = 3): Given my reserved nature and minimal talkativeness, it doesn't excite me.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4): Neutral appeal; energy and appearance focus resonates somewhat.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score = 5): It seems credible for its promises of energy boost and looking best, but not overwhelmingly convincing.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score = 2): Not visually or emotionally engaging due to my reserved disposition.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score = 1): Strongly disagree; personal routine doesn't align with a daily energy drink.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score = 3): Neutral, might consider trying it out under specific circumstances or recommendations from trusted sources.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score = 3): Slightly positive consideration but not high priority in my current lifestyle.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat appealing due to its practical claims, my personality traits and present circumstances don't make me a likely buyer. Thus, scores reflect cautious interest without strong intent.
