**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score: 2). As someone who is reserved and not particularly talkative or outgoing, I find it less appealing to be directly targeted with a "without this drink" message.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral leaning Agree (Score: 3). The concept of fatigue prevention can pique interest for an office worker, but its execution may lack novelty.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly Positive (Score: 4). It effectively communicates a negative consequence without the drink, which aligns with my preference for direct messaging.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral leaning Agree (Score: 3). The message isn't overly dramatic and resonates well with concerns about energy levels at work.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Likely, but not guaranteed (Score: 5). My thorough approach means I'd evaluate the product based on actual performance rather than just ad appeal.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** High chance of trial due to my generally trusting nature and desire for productivity boost (Score: 6).
   - **Consider buying this product:** Strong consideration, driven by concern about fatigue and looking dull (Score: 7).

Overall, while the ad's messaging resonates at a practical level, it doesn't fully capture emotional engagement or excite me as an individual. However, my focus on thoroughness and planning leads to high levels of intent if the product promises tangible benefits.
