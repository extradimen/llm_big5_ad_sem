**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - *Like* (2): Neutral because, while not outright disliked, there's no strong emotional connection.
   - *Interesting* (3): Somewhat engaging but doesn't grab my full attention.
   - *Good* (4): It presents a useful message of energy and appearance improvements, somewhat convincing on paper.
   - *Attractive* (5): The concept appeals mildly; it aligns with daily well-being goals.

2. **Purchase Intention:** 
   - Despite the ad being somewhat appealing:
     - *Intend* (3): Neutral leaning towards not making an immediate purchase decision due to financial constraints and reserved nature.
     - *Try* (4): Cautious but open; I might consider a small trial size or lower-priced variant.
     - *Consider* (4): Given my tendency for careful planning, I’ll weigh the benefits against budget concerns before deciding.

Overall, while there is mild attraction to the ad's promise of vitality and self-care, practical considerations—like monthly income constraints and personal traits like being reserved and a bit careless about trying new products—temper any strong inclination to buy. The scores reflect balanced skepticism mixed with cautious optimism.
