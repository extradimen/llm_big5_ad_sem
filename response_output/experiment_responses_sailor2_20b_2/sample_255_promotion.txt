**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *I like the ad:* While not strongly positive (4), I find it somewhat appealing given my sociable nature and desire for a product that can help me look good.
  - *Interesting:* Neutral to slightly agree (5) because staying energized is relevant, but it doesn’t spark high interest on its own.
  - *Good:* Agree (6). The message seems reasonably credible, though it’s not groundbreaking enough to be outstanding for someone like me with a busy yet moderate lifestyle.
  - *Attractive:* Somewhat agree (3) – visually and conceptually it might draw attention, but there's room for improvement in the presentation.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to purchase this product:* Low intent (2). Even though I appreciate its benefits, budget constraints and lack of urgent need weigh against a strong intention.
  - *Try to buy this product:* Strongly disagree (1). Given my conservative approach towards expenses, trying it out is unlikely unless there's an exceptional offer or necessity arises.
  - *Consider buying the product:* Neutral leaning slightly positive (3). The idea has merit; I might consider purchasing if circumstances align and affordability improves.

Overall, while the ad resonates on a moderate level with its benefits and my sociable preferences, practical considerations such as cost and personal urgency hold back strong purchase intentions.
