**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** *Score: 6* — I appreciate its intent to promote energy and appearance. It resonates with my active lifestyle but feels slightly over-promised.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 5* — The concept is intriguing, especially for someone who prioritizes productivity, but it's not groundbreaking.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4* — While effective in conveying benefits, I feel some skepticism about universal results and potential gimmickry.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3* — Visual appeal could be better; needs a more engaging design to fully attract my attention.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2* — I don't have immediate plans due to concerns about effectiveness and long-term benefits.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** *Score: 1* — Low intention because my current energy drinks are sufficient, and trying new products isn’t urgent.
  - **Will consider buying it:** *Score: 2* — It’s on the radar for future consideration if reviews align with my expectations or there's a compelling reason to switch.

Overall, while I appreciate the message and find parts of it appealing, personal experience and existing routines mean immediate purchase intent is low. Further information or endorsements might sway me positively in the future.
