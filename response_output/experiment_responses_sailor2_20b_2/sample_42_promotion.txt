**Explanation:**
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like (4/7):** Neutral; while the idea is appealing, my reserved nature doesn't make me overly enthusiastic about it.
  - **Interesting (3/7):** Slightly Agree; it grabs attention but needs more substance to fully engage.
  - **Good (5/7):** Strongly Agree; health benefits and daily well-being are key priorities for a civil servant, so this aspect is appealing.
  - **Attractive (4/7):** Somewhat Positive; visually or conceptually pleasing enough to draw interest but not overwhelmingly persuasive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (3/7):** Considerable but cautious. While I appreciate the product's benefits, there must be further trust in the brand.
  - **Try (2/7):** Might test it out based on reviews or personal needs for energy and appearance management.
  - **Consider (5/7):** Definite consideration; aligns with my goals to stay energetic and look good daily.

Balancing practicality, health benefits, and a neutral-to-positive attitude towards the ad makes me inclined toward considering this product. However, strong purchase intent is influenced by additional reassurances or personal validation of its effectiveness.
