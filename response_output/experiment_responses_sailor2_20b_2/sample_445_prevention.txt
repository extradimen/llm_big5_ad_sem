### Explanation:

**Attitude toward the advertisement:**
- **4 (Like)**: The neutral stance on talkativeness and trustfulness means you generally accept its message but aren't particularly drawn in by it.
- **3 (Interesting)**: As someone who values thoroughness, you might find parts of the ad compelling, yet your overall social reserved nature reduces enthusiasm for a flashy or high-energy presentation.
- **5 (Good)**: Your strong trust and analytical nature likely make you appreciate an effective, straightforward approach to health/well-being concerns.
- **2 (Attractive)**: The advertising style may not match your preference for more subdued communication; hence it's unappealing.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **1 (Strongly Disagree)**: Despite believing the ad could be informative, its attractiveness and persuasive power do not align with your preferences or current needs.
- **2 (Disagree)**: Even though you appreciate its message quality, thereâ€™s insufficient drive to actively seek out this product immediately.
- **3 (Neutral)**: While open-minded about health improvements, other factors like budgeting priorities might delay a purchase decision.

In summary, the advertisement is seen as informative but not particularly compelling or engaging for your reserved and methodical personality. You appreciate its substance yet don't feel strongly motivated to buy right now.
