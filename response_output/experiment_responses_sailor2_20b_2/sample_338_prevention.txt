**Detailed Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
  1. **Like**: 3 - The ad feels somewhat appealing but not strongly due to its simplicity.
  2. **Interesting**: 4 - It piques mild curiosity about staying alert, especially for someone with a busy schedule.
  3. **Good**: 5 - I appreciate the message highlighting potential drawbacks without feeling overly aggressive or manipulative.
  4. **Attractive**: 2 - The overall aesthetic and messaging don't significantly draw me in; it feels more functional than visually appealing.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point Scale):**
  1. **Intend to Purchase**: 4 - While the concept resonates, there are other factors like cost and brand trust that need consideration.
  2. **Will Try to Buy**: 4 - Given my cautious nature, I might give it a try if offered at an affordable price or with good reviews.
  3. **Consider Buying**: 3 - The ad is persuasive enough for me to keep the option in mind, especially during times when fatigue affects productivity.

Overall, this advertisement aligns well with my values of diligence and efficiency but needs stronger emotional appeal or additional incentives to drive a firm purchase decision. Its credibility and product information would influence whether I choose it over other options.
