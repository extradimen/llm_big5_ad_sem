**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral leaning slightly positive because while helpful in nature, it's not inherently appealing given my preference for more creative content.
   - **Interesting:** Agreeable; the message is clear about preventing tiredness and dull appearance.
   - **Good:** Slightly agree since it effectively communicates a need to address fatigue, which resonates with busy individuals like myself.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral leaning towards moderately attractive. The ad appeals as informative but lacks strong emotional engagement or unique creativity.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Low moderate (score 2) due to personal preference for products backed by credible science and direct benefits rather than implied claims.
   - **Try/Consider:** Slightly above neutral; the potential practical benefit might prompt a trial, especially if accompanied by a good review or recommendation from peers.
   
Overall, while finding the ad informative and somewhat useful, my strong agreement on originality in ideas suggests that I prefer ads with unique concepts. The lack of emotional appeal and high emphasis on personal benefits drive moderate consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
