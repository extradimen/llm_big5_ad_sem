**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **Like (4/7):** Neutral leaning towards slight liking; the claim is straightforward but not particularly engaging.
    - **Interesting (5/7):** It peaks my curiosity with a clear issue addressed (feeling tired and looking dull), making it moderately interesting.
    - **Good (6/7):** The ad effectively communicates potential benefits, so I find its message solidly good without being over-the-top.
    - **Attractive (3/7):** While functional, the appeal isn't strong enough to be highly attractive due to my reserved and practical nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (2/7):** As a diligent office worker with high responsibility levels, I value prevention, but other factors like price point and personal routine impact decisions heavily.
    - **Try (1/7):** Given my tendency to be careful in purchases and sometimes careless about new products, I'm not inclined to commit without more evidence of efficacy.
    - **Consider (2/7):** There's a slight inclination to consider it if aligned with other health priorities or when presented with reliable testimonials from trusted sources.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately but lacks enough compelling features to drive an immediate purchase decision. It aligns somewhat well with preventive habits yet falls short on emotional engagement and personal urgency for me personally.
