**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad*: Neutral (score of 4). While it does convey a clear benefit, my reserved nature makes me cautious about immediate liking.
   - *Interesting*: Somewhat agree (score of 3). The message is straightforward but doesn't captivate much due to its predictability for someone in an office environment dealing with fatigue daily.
   - *Good Advertisement*: Agree (score of 5). It effectively communicates a practical concern—feeling tired and looking dull—which resonates as relatable, especially given my stressful work routine.
   - *Attractive*: Disagree (score of 2). The ad's appeal is limited; it lacks creative elements or emotional depth that would draw me in more strongly.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase this product*: Strongly agree (score of 6). Given the realistic problem addressed, I’m inclined to try a solution if it helps with fatigue and appearance.
   - *Will try to buy this product*: Agree (score of 5). There's a strong motivation to alleviate my current symptoms but not an immediate commitment due to cautious nature.
   - *Consider buying this product*: Strongly agree (score of 7). The advertisement definitely prompts consideration, especially as it aligns with personal goals for productivity and well-being. 

In summary, while the ad isn't highly attractive in terms of creativity or emotional engagement, its clear message about preventing fatigue fits my needs well enough to foster strong purchase intent and consideration. However, my reserved nature means a moderate level of immediate liking rather than enthusiasm.
