**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** *Neutral* (4) — The ad is somewhat engaging, but not particularly inspiring.
  - **Interesting:** *Agree* (5) — It captures my attention with its claim about fatigue and appearance.
  - **Good:** *Strongly Agree* (6) — I appreciate how the message highlights a common issue that resonates, making it feel relevant.
  - **Attractive:** *Agree* (5) — The visual appeal might attract me if coupled with an authentic product benefit.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** *Consider* (3) — While I see the value in managing fatigue, other factors like price and past experiences will influence my decision.
  - **Try to buy:** *Try* (2) — Given my budget constraints (VND 26M-35M/month), I might give it a try if reviews are positive or during sales promotions.
  - **Consider buying:** *Consider* (3) — The ad has prompted me to think about the product, but hesitation from concerns like thoroughness in execution will lead me to gather more information before making a purchase.

Overall, while the advertisement is effective in presenting an issue I can relate to and offering potential relief, my cautious nature and desire for reliable effectiveness means it doesn't drive immediate action. Hence, scores reflect thoughtful consideration rather than outright intent or reluctance.
