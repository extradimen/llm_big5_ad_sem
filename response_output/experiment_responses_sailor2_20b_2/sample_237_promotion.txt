**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad (4):** Neutral-leaning agree; itâ€™s okay but doesn't excite me due to my preference for more detailed information.
  - **Interesting (3):** Moderately interesting; the promise of energy and looking best is appealing, but lacks specific details or personal connection.
  - **Good (5):** Slightly positive as the benefits are clear, aligning with a desire for wellness, though it needs stronger credibility.
  - **Attractive (2):** Neutral leaning towards disagree; while visual appeal might be okay, its overall design and message do not strongly resonate.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase (2):** Mildly likely because the benefits are appealing but need further information about ingredients, user reviews.
  - **Will try to buy (1):** Low likelihood; I prefer more direct engagement before committing.
  - **Consider buying (3):** Somewhat considered; it's on my radar but not a priority without additional details.

My high level of trust combined with the desire for thorough information and careful planning makes me cautious about quick purchases, hence moderate scores. The ad could be improved by adding credible testimonials or more detailed health claims to match my values.
