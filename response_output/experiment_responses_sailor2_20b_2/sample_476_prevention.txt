**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3 - Neutral)
   - As a reserved and emotionally stable individual, I'm not particularly drawn to the ad but find it neither offensive nor appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4 - Agree)
   - The preventive aspect of "without this drink" grabbing attention about feeling tired or looking dull resonates somewhat due to my practical nature and need for energy during workdays, making it moderately engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 2 - Disagree)
   - While understandable in its messaging, I find it a bit overreaching without concrete evidence or personal experience backing up the claims about appearance and fatigue alleviation.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3 - Neutral)
   - The imagery might be okay, but overall attractiveness is neutral due to my reserved nature; it doesn't captivate me enough personally.

### Purchase Intentions:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my budget constraints and the lack of compelling evidence in the ad, I don’t see immediate value in buying this product regularly.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)
   - Trying it out is unlikely because there's no strong motivation or trust built through the advertisement alone.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2 - Slightly Agree)
   - There’s a marginal consideration if I come across additional, credible reviews or offers that align with my needs and budget; otherwise, it remains low on my priority list.

Overall, while the ad is moderately interesting and somewhat believable in concept, it falls short of compelling me to make any immediate purchase decisions given my cautious nature and current priorities.
