**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: *Score = 3 (Disagree)* - While I appreciate some promotional content, this specific energy drink advertisement doesn't resonate strongly with me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: *Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - Given my introverted nature and sometimes negative social interactions, I find such ads less engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: *Score = 4 (Neutral)** - It's not bad but also doesn't inspire me; its message feels generic.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: *Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - The concept of staying energized and looking best isn’t particularly appealing to my personal lifestyle or self-image.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)** - Due to high stress levels, financial constraints, and a neutral perception towards the ad, buying seems unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - There's no compelling reason or interest in trying out this specific drink.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: *Score = 2 (Disagree)** - Although it’s not completely off my radar, the current circumstances and lack of strong appeal make me unlikely to seriously consider purchasing.

In summary, while the advertisement might meet some basic promotional standards, its relevance and attractiveness do not align with my personal traits or needs. Consequently, my purchase intentions are minimal despite a neutral-to-negative evaluation of the ad itself.
