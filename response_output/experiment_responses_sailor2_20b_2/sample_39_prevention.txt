**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:**  
  - **Like (4/7):** The ad appeals somewhat because it resonates with the potential benefits of combating fatigue and appearance dullness.
  - **Interesting (5/7):** Intriguing by highlighting common issues, but not exceptionally engaging given my reserved nature towards exaggerated claims.
  - **Good (3/7):** Perceived as credible to some extent due to addressing a real concern; however, the presentation lacks personal appeal.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** Less visually or conceptually attractive for me, given my tendency towards carelessness and lack of interest in being meticulously persuasive.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend (1/7):** Strongly disagree; while understanding the productâ€™s potential benefits, current financial constraints make a purchase unlikely.
  - **Try (2/7):** Mild inclination to test it out if offered at an affordable price or during special promotions due to curiosity about results.
  - **Consider (3/7):** Willingness to consider buying in future but not immediately; priorities lie elsewhere, and the ad doesn't create urgent need. 

Overall, the ad has moderate appeal but falls short of motivating a purchase given my circumstances and personality traits.
