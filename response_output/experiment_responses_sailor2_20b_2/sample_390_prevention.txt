**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - **Like**: Neutral (3). The ad's message is straightforward but doesn't particularly resonate emotionally given my introverted nature and focus on practical needs over appearance.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4). It does catch attention with its preventive aspect, making it slightly engaging for someone looking to avoid tiredness or dull looks. 
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5). The ad effectively highlights a problem ("tiredness" and "dull look") that aligns with real concerns about work productivity and well-being.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (2). Despite the message's relevance, it feels somewhat superficial compared to my values of practicality and emotional stability. I appreciate helpful solutions but don't find ads overly attractive on their own.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend**: Strongly Disagree (1). While understanding its benefits, my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make an immediate purchase unlikely.
   - **Try**: Neutral (3). I might be open to trying the product if it’s affordable and recommended by trusted sources or friends.
   - **Consider**: Agree (4). Given its potential benefits for energy levels and appearance, which are important in my daily life, I will definitely consider purchasing after reviewing pricing and user experiences.

In summary, while appreciating the ad's message and considering practical benefits, personal financial limitations influence a strong reluctance to immediate purchase. However, there’s a moderate interest in exploring it further if budget constraints allow or positive feedback is received.
