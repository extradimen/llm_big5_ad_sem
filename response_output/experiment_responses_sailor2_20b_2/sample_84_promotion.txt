**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like (2):* As someone who is generally not talkative or outgoing, I find the ad somewhat appealing but don't strongly resonate with its overtly energetic and confident messaging.
   - *Interesting (3):* It's moderately interesting due to highlighting benefits like energy and appearance enhancement, though it doesn’t fully capture my attention.
   - *Good (4):* The claim seems plausible for maintaining daily performance, which is valuable, but the presentation feels a bit over-the-top for someone who prioritizes authenticity.
   - *Attractive (3):* While visually attractive in terms of design and aesthetics, the overall tone doesn’t perfectly align with my personal style or preferences.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase:* At 5 out of 7, there is a moderate intention because it addresses concerns about energy levels and appearance, which are relevant to maintaining daily productivity.
   - *Try to buy (6):* Given my tendency towards trying new things if they seem beneficial without being overly intrusive, I am inclined to give this product a try despite reservations from the ad's presentation.
   - *Consider buying:* Strongly consider at 7 due to its clear health and wellness benefits aligning with personal goals of staying efficient, especially as an aspiring civil servant balancing multiple responsibilities. The innovative idea (strongly agree) makes me open-minded towards trying it.

Overall, while I'm not entirely enamored by the ad's approach, the product’s core promises are appealing enough to warrant a try and potential future purchase.
