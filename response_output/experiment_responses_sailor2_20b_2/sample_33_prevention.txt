**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *Like*: Neutral leans toward Agree because while not strongly engaging, it addresses a recognizable concern (feeling tired).
   - *Interesting*: Slightly above neutral as the message is clear and straightforward about benefits of staying alert.
   - *Good*: Agrees with its clarity on healthiness perception but doesn't stand out significantly due to common nature.
   - *Attractive*: Moderate attractiveness, relevant for a managerial employee looking for productivity boosts.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Neutral leaning towards Agree as it's aligned with self-improvement goals, despite moderate skepticism about advertising claims.
   - *Try to Buy*: Likely due to the practical nature of preventing fatigue which resonates moderately well.
   - *Consider Buying*: High likelihood because it fits within budget constraints (under 15 million VND) and aligns with personal care habits.

Overall, though not overly compelling or exciting, the ad has a reasonable chance of influencing purchase consideration based on its relevance to daily stress management and productivity.
