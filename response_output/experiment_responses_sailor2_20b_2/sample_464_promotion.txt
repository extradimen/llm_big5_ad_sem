**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
  - I **like** it (score: 3): While not strongly favorable, my reserved nature means I find some appeal in its promise of energy and looking good.
  - It's **interesting** to me (score: 4): The concept seems engaging given the emphasis on daily performance enhancement.
  - I believe it’s **good** (score: 5) based on its positive messaging, but my guarded trust means it doesn’t hit home strongly.
  - Finding it **attractive** is moderate (score: 2), as the visuals and claims don't align fully with my reserved disposition.

- **Purchase intention:** 
  - I **intend to purchase this product** (score: 1): High skepticism due to a tendency toward thoroughness, making me wary of quick promises.
  - I might **try it**, but cautiously (score: 2): Curiosity gets piqued by the active imagination and originality aspects; however, my cautious nature holds back full commitment.
  - Considering buying it is in the mix (score: 3): It's not dismissed entirely but remains a distant consideration due to personal habits and financial constraints. 

Overall, while I appreciate its appeal and innovation, practical concerns and conservative tendencies influence lower scores for purchase intent.
