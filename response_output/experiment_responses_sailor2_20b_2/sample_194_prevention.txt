**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3): The message resonates, but it's not particularly engaging for me personally.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4): It piques curiosity about fatigue prevention and appearance enhancement.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5): I appreciate its clear messaging and potential health benefits.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2): While the content is good, the overall appeal could be better with a more visually appealing presentation or stronger emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (3): The ad convinces me of its usefulness but doesn't drive an immediate purchase.
   - **Try to Buy:** Agree (4): I'm open to giving it a try based on the potential benefits for energy and appearance.
   - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Agree (5): It aligns with my desire for wellness, so I'll definitely keep this product in mind for future purchases.

Overall, while there are areas where the ad could improve its attractiveness, its effectiveness in highlighting preventive health benefits is compelling enough to make me seriously consider adding it to my routine.
