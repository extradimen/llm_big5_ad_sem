**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (3):** I have a neutral to mildly positive feeling towards the ad; it doesn't strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting (4):** The message is moderately interesting but not compelling enough given my reserved and careful nature.
  - **Good (5):** I view this as an average advertisement—no strong negatives, but nothing extraordinary either.
  - **Attractive (2):** It falls short of being attractive; the promise seems somewhat manipulative to me.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
  - **Intend (1):** Strongly disagree—I am not motivated to purchase based on this ad alone.
  - **Try (2):** Slightly agree—there might be a small curiosity, but it's minimal given my thorough and careful approach.
  - **Consider (3):** Neutral/possibly consider—if other factors (e.g., personal needs or reviews) align better, I could think about buying.

In summary, while the ad is adequately constructed, its persuasive power doesn’t match up with my cautious and reserved personality. It lacks enough compelling appeal to drive a significant purchase decision. Therefore, it garners mostly moderate-to-low scores.
