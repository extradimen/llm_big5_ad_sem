**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes (7-Point Scale):**
   - **Like the Ad**: I'm moderately positive about it, but not extremely so (`score = 4`).
     * Reason: The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to my values around productivity and appearance.
   - **Interesting**: Find it engaging, given its focus on daily benefits (`score = 5`).
     * Reason: It speaks directly to common goalsâ€”staying productive and maintaining a healthy look.
   - **Good Advertisement**: Believe the message is effective in conveying benefits (`score = 6`).
     * Reason: Clear value propositions are generally credible, but it lacks specific details that might convince me fully.
   - **Attractive**: Slightly find it visually appealing, though not strongly so (`score = 3`).
     * Reason: Visual design could be improved to better capture attention.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-Point Scale):**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Mild intention to buy based on its potential benefits (`score = 2`).
     * Reason: While the ad resonates, there are competing options and personal habits that influence my decision.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Moderately inclined to give it a try (`score = 4`).
     * Reason: Curiosity about real-life effectiveness motivates me more than immediate commitment.
   - **Consider Buying**: Open to considering the product, particularly for its potential energy and appearance perks (`score = 3`).
     * Reason: Balancing practical benefits with affordability and other alternatives.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message and find it somewhat appealing, my current state (budget constraints, personal routines) leads me to a cautious yet positive evaluation. This balances into moderately good attitudes towards the ad but not full commitment for purchase.
