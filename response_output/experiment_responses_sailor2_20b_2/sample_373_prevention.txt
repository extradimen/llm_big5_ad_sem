**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (3)** - Disagree slightly; while I appreciate its message of preventing fatigue and dullness, it lacks excitement for me.
2. **Interesting (4)** - Neutral to slightly agree; the concept is straightforward but not particularly engaging or unique in my opinion.
3. **Believe the ad is good (5)** - Agree moderately; it delivers a clear benefit but seems typical without much originality.
4. **Attractive (2)** - Disagree; its simplicity might come across as bland rather than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (3)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly agree; I recognize the value, yet other factors (brand, price) influence my decision.
2. **Will try to buy this product (3)** - Neutral with a slight incline toward trying it out if convenience and cost are right.
3. **Consider buying this product (4)** - Agree moderately; there's enough incentive to consider adding the drink to my routine but not strong enough for immediate action.

Overall, while I acknowledge its utility in addressing common feelings of tiredness and dullness, additional compelling factors such as brand credibility or personal relevance would sway me more towards actual purchase intent.
