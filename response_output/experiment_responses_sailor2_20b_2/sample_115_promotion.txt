**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - *Like the ad:* Neutral leaning towards agreement because while being sociable, the promise of staying energized aligns with daily demands.
   - *Interesting*: Mildly neutral; it's a common claim but not overly engaging for my reserved nature.
   - *Believe is good*: Slightly agree due to its aspirational appeal in maintaining energy and appearance, fitting well within health-conscious mindset.
   - *Attractive:* Disagree slightly; lacking specific details or personal resonance, making the overall design less appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase:* Neutral because though it aligns with desires for daily energy, I need more information on efficacy and value.
   - *Will try*: Mild inclination towards trying based on potential benefits and balanced lifestyle goals.
   - *Consider buying:* Slightly agree; the ad prompts consideration given its alignment with health routines, but not a guaranteed purchase without additional research. 

Balancing practicality (worry about cost/efficacy) with desire for wellness keeps my scores moderate yet positive towards the product concept.
