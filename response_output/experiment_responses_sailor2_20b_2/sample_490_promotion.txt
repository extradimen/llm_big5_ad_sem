**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (5)**: The ad's claim to help stay energized resonates with my active lifestyle as a civil servant and someone who values productivity.
2. **Interesting (6)**: I appreciate its focus on daily performance enhancement, which is appealing from both an energy boost and personal grooming perspective.
3. **Good (4.5)**: While the messaging seems solid, it could be more convincing with additional proof or testimonials to bolster credibility.
4. **Attractive (4)**: The ad's overall presentation captures attention but lacks a strong emotional connection for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (3.5)**: Although I like the idea, my current energy management routines are effective, so immediate purchase intention is moderate.
2. **Try (2.5)**: If it were to be featured in a trusted store or backed by reliable reviews, I might give it a try out of curiosity and interest in staying energized.
3. **Consider (4)**: The product warrants consideration for future use; my generally trusting nature makes me open to new energy solutions provided they align with personal needs.

Overall, the ad is positive but not compelling enough to drive an immediate purchase decision due to existing routines and a desire for more evidence-based support. However, it successfully piques interest and keeps me in the market for such products.
