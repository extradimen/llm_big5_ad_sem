**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude (Scores):**
   - **Like:** Neutral (Score 4) – The ad presents a generic claim that might appeal but doesn't strongly engage me.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly Disagree (Score 3) – While the message is straightforward, it lacks novelty or unique aspects to captivate attention fully.
   - **Good:** Agree (Score 5) – It's well-crafted and clear in its purpose; however, personal appeal isn't strong enough for a higher score.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral Tendency Towards Disagree (Score 2) – The visual or emotional attraction is lacking. Given my preferences, it doesn't stand out.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Agree (Score 6) – Despite some reservations in liking the ad, as a manager with high energy demands and health consciousness, I might still consider it beneficial.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Strongly Agree (Score 6) – The promise of staying energized aligns well with my responsibilities. Hence, there’s motivation to give it a try.
   - **Consider Buying:** Very High Consideration (Score 7) – Though the ad doesn't excite me greatly, its practical benefits and alignment with self-care make it highly likely I would consider purchasing.

In summary, while my overall attitude towards the advertisement is moderate-to-positive, strong personal needs for energy and performance drive a high intent to purchase. The balance between skepticism about direct appeal and understanding of product value results in favorable yet nuanced scores.
