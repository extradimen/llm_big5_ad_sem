**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (3/7):** While I appreciate its message of staying energized and looking good, my reserved nature means it doesn't strongly resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** The idea is intriguing as energy boosters are common in Southeast Asia for daily routines, but not particularly captivating given the saturated market.
   - **Good (5/7):** It conveys a clear benefit which can be appealing to those who prioritize their appearance and productivity. Neutral leans towards agreeable since itâ€™s functional.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** As someone reserved with high self-trust, I find the overall presentation slightly less visually or conceptually attractive compared to my usual preferences.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2/7):** Despite liking its message, personal habits and budget constraints mean it's not a top priority.
   - **Try (2/7):** I might consider sampling the product if available at a reasonable price, influenced by my strong work ethic but cautious nature.
   - **Consider (4/7):** Given occasional trust issues, I would evaluate user reviews and pricing before making a decision. The balance of necessity vs. luxury places it in the "consideration" zone.

These scores reflect a thoughtful yet moderate approach due to personality traits like sociability mixed with caution and budget concerns. While not strongly persuaded by the ad itself, there's still an open mind for potential purchase if conditions align better.
