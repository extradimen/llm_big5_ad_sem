**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like (4):** Despite being talkative and generally trusting, I'm moderately interested in ads promoting wellness and energy. However, it's not overwhelmingly appealing.
  - **Interesting (3):** The concept is generic; although energizing drinks are relevant, nothing unique sparks my interest.
  - **Good (5):** As a civil servant with high standards for personal appearance and productivity, the message aligns wellâ€”though slightly overrated in its claims.
  - **Attractive (2):** Being somewhat reserved, I find the advertisement visually engaging but not striking enough to stand out.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend (2):** While I appreciate staying energized and looking good, my budget constraints limit immediate high-priority purchases on beverages.
  - **Try (3):** Curiosity piques slightly; given its promise, I might give it a try if available at reasonable prices during promotions or discounts.
  - **Consider (4):** As someone with regular routines and planning habits ("Strongly Agree"), the product is within consideration for future purchases when my budget allows.

In summary, though not overly persuasive, this ad resonates moderately due to its alignment with health goals. While I may eventually consider it, current intentions lean toward a more cautious approach regarding spending.
