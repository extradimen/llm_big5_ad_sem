**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad (4/7):** The message is straightforward but feels somewhat over-generalized; it doesn't strongly resonate.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):** It's not particularly engaging given my preference for clear, practical information.
3. **I believe the ad is good (2/7):** While truthful about potential fatigue and dullness, there isn’t enough compelling detail to convince me of its effectiveness.
4. **I find the ad attractive (1/7):** The appeal falls short due to a lack of personal connection or unique selling points.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):** Not high, as it lacks strong motivation based on my daily routines and financial constraints.
2. **I will try to buy this product (3/7):** Somewhat likely if there's a compelling reason or special offer, but not a priority.
3. **I will consider buying this product (2/7):** Mild consideration due to trust in the brand’s credibility over time, but other factors like price and necessity are key.

Overall, while I appreciate its directness, the ad doesn’t strongly align with my cautious yet thorough approach to making purchasing decisions. It falls short on emotional connection, personal relevance, and practical benefits required for a high purchase intent score given my lifestyle and financial situation.
