**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad: **3**: Neutral. While not strongly opposed, it lacks appeal to my reserved and cautious nature.
  - The ad is interesting: **4**: Slightly agree. It raises awareness about fatigue but doesn't resonate emotionally or creatively enough for me.
  - The ad is good: **2**: Disagree slightly. Seems too focused on negatives (tiredness, dull appearance) without offering a compelling solution.
  - I find the ad attractive: **1**: Strongly disagree. Lacks attractiveness due to its manipulative tone and lack of emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (7-point scale):**
  - I intend to purchase this product: **2**: Neutral, leaning toward no intention. The fear-based messaging doesn't align with my careful decision-making process.
  - I will try to buy this product: **2**: Neutral but slightly inclined to avoidance due to skepticism about the claims.
  - I will consider buying this product: **1**: Strongly disagree. Given my tendency towards thoroughness and reluctance to impulse buys, there is little motivation to seriously consider it.

Overall, while understanding its aim to prevent fatigue, the ad fails to connect with me deeply or build trust due to manipulative language and a lack of emotional stability appealâ€”thus, low purchase intention scores. I value factual evidence more over fear-driven marketing.
