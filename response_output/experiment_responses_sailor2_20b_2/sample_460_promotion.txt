**Detailed Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitude**
1. **I like the ad:** 
   - **Score (3): Neutral/Positive**  
     The advertisement's promise of energy and looking good appeals to a sense of daily well-being but doesn't evoke strong enthusiasm.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 
   - **Score (4): Agree**  
     It catches attention by addressing common concerns about staying energized, making it somewhat engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**
   - **Score (4): Neutral/Positive**  
     While believable in intent, the claim's broadness leaves room for skepticism without concrete evidence or specifics.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 
   - **Score (5): Agree**  
     The idea of feeling and looking better daily is visually appealing despite personal care tendencies towards practicality.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**
   - **Score (2): Neutral/Disagree**  
     Although intrigued, the high price threshold relative to my monthly income makes a strong intent low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** 
   - **Score (1.5): Strongly Disagree**  
     Financial constraints and cautious nature prevent an attempt without additional incentives or affordability.

3. **I will consider buying the product:**
   - **Score (2): Neutral/Disagree**  
     While it's not entirely off my radar, given its premium positioning against my budget, serious consideration is unlikely until more accessible options emerge.

In summary:
- The ad resonates on a basic level but lacks immediate persuasive power due to financial constraints and the need for practicality.
- Despite some positive aspects (engagement & attractiveness), purchasing intent remains low because of affordability concerns.
