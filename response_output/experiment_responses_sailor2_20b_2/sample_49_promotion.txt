**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude

1. **I like the ad**: **Score = 3 (Disagree)**  
   Despite being a civil servant and finding some value in self-care products, my reserved nature makes it hard for me to connect emotionally with the ad.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: **Score = 4 (Neutral/Agree)**  
   The promise of energy and looking good appeals slightly but isn't particularly engaging given my preference for substance over presentation.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: **Score = 5 (Somewhat Agree)**  
   While it's a well-crafted message, my generally low trust in quick fixes means I donâ€™t fully buy into its claims without more evidence or personal experience.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: **Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)**  
   The overt focus on appearance and instant benefits doesn't align with my reserved demeanor; it feels superficial to me.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: **Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)**
    Given the lack of personal connection, urgency felt by the ad, and skepticism about quick results, I have no intention of buying right away.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: **Score = 2 (Disagree/Neutral)**  
   Curiosity might push me slightly towards giving it a trial if someone recommends it based on trustworthy feedback, but not otherwise.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: **Score = 4 (Somewhat Agree)**
    Despite my reluctance to be sold by the ad, I acknowledge that energy and appearance matter for daily productivity and social interactions, making it worth considering under appropriate circumstances or with endorsements from people I trust. 

Overall, while not strongly opposed, the advertisement doesn't persuade me due to its surface-level appeal and lack of alignment with my reserved yet helpful nature. My cautious approach makes me less likely to take an immediate purchase decision but leaves room for consideration if further convinced by external validation.
