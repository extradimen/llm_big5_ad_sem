**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - *Like (4):* The ad doesn't resonate strongly due to its generic and slightly manipulative tone.
   - *Interesting (5):* It raises awareness about potential negative outcomes without being particularly captivating or innovative.
   - *Good (3):* Lacks creativity and depth, making it just functional but not impressive.
   - *Attractive (2):* The ad is unattractively focused on negatives rather than highlighting the benefits in a positive light.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
   - *Intend to Purchase (1):* Strongly disagree; I wouldn't be inclined to buy based solely on this ad.
   - *Try to Buy (1):* Disagree; no compelling reason or excitement from the advertisement.
   - *Consider Buying (1):* Also disagree; despite being aware of potential benefits, there's minimal incentive for me to explore further.

In summary, while acknowledging its preventative message, my reserved and analytical nature finds this ad unappealing and insufficiently persuasive. It fails to align with my preference for thoughtful marketing approaches and thus does not drive a purchase intention.
