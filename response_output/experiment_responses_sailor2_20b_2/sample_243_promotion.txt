**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Strongly Disagree (2): Given my reserved nature and the high level of stress, an energy drink ad might not appeal to me personally.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree (3): I find it less engaging compared to other daily needs or tasks; it seems more like a generic marketing message.
   - **Good:** Neutral (4): It's fine but lacks emotional connection. The claims resonate superficially without strong personal relevance.
   - **Attractive:** Somewhat Agree (5): There is some attraction due to the promise of energy and looking good, although not enough to strongly draw me in.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Strongly Disagree (2): My low income (<15 million VND) makes luxury or non-essential items like an expensive drink unaffordable.
   - **Try:** Disagree (3): Even if it were affordable, the routine and stress in my life don't create a compelling reason to give this product a try right now.
   - **Consider:** Neutral (4): The concept of staying energized is somewhat appealing but not crucial enough given other priorities, so I might consider it for future consideration without immediate action.

Overall, while there's some mild attraction and neutral acknowledgment, the ad doesn't strongly influence my purchase intentions due to budget constraints, personal priorities, and a more cautious approach to non-essential expenditures.
