**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral to slightly positive (score: 4)
   - Given my personality traits, I appreciate energetic and positive messaging but don't find it overwhelmingly appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (score: 5)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with me as a postgraduate blue-collar worker balancing tasks.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (score: 6)
   - It aligns well with my values for productivity and maintaining an active lifestyle, making it credible in terms of benefits offered.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly Disagree/Neutral (score: 3)
   - While I appreciate its message, visual appeal or emotional connection isn't strongly evoked.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral / Low Intent (score: 2)
   - Practical benefits are clear but immediate commitment is cautious due to financial constraints and existing habits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Maybe/Considered (score: 3)
   - The idea of giving it a try aligns with my proactive nature, especially if affordable samples or promotions are available.

3. **I will consider buying the product**: Somewhat Likely (score: 4)
   - Overall, there's interest but I'll evaluate further based on budget constraints and personal need for sustained energy throughout workdays.

**Conclusion:** The advertisement is effective in conveying its benefits which align with my priorities. While not highly compelling enough to spur an immediate purchase due to financial considerations, it earns high consideration as a potential supplement for maintaining daily productivity and well-being.
