**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While I appreciate its energy-focused message and visual appeal, it doesn't resonate deeply due to my neutral stance on some lifestyle aspects.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - The concept of staying energized and looking good appeals generally but falls short in captivating me fully.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)** - As a civil servant, I prioritize practicality over glossy marketing; this message feels somewhat superficial for my daily routine needs.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 6)** - The visual elements are appealing and can grab attention initially, but it doesn't evoke strong personal connection or motivation to engage deeply.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - While I acknowledge its potential benefits, my limited budget restricts immediate consideration.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - My financial constraints and current priorities make it unlikely that I'll actively seek out or trial the product in the near future.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - There's a mild interest, but given my limited income and existing consumption patterns, further evaluation may be needed before deciding to buy.

Overall, while acknowledging its effectiveness from an engagement perspective, practical constraints and personal priorities lead me towards moderate liking and low immediate purchase intent.
