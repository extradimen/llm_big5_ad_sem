**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *I like the ad*: Neutral (3) — The ad does not particularly resonate or excite me.
  - *Interesting:* Disagree (2) — As a reserved and somewhat cautious person, I find it less engaging.
  - *Good quality:* Agree (4) — It has reasonable claims about energy and appearance which are potentially beneficial.
  - *Attractive*: Neutral (3) — The presentation is not compelling enough to draw strong interest.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Disagree (2) — My current financial constraints make a direct purchase less likely.
  - *Try the product*: Somewhat consider trying it, but no immediate impulse (2).
  - *Consider buying:* Moderate consideration (4) — Given its benefits and my tendency towards being helpful with self-care, I might eventually decide to give it a try if circumstances permit.

Overall, while there's some positive perception of the ad’s message, practical considerations related to budget and cautious nature keep purchase intentions relatively low.
