**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) – Given my reserved nature and slight hesitation to be overtly persuasive, I find the ad pleasant but not overwhelmingly appealing.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – It intrigues me due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, aligning somewhat with practical concerns.
  - **Good:** Somewhat agree (5) – The concept is well-constructed, though not exceptionally compelling for my tastes or priorities.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – I'm more reserved in general, so the attractiveness factor doesn't resonate strongly.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly disagree (1) – Given my cautious approach and current financial constraints (~30 million VND), immediate purchase is unlikely.
  - **Try to Buy:** Disagree (2) – While intrigued, there are no compelling reasons for an urgent or trial-based decision at the moment.
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral/Agree slightly (3) – I might evaluate it further if circumstances change and align with personal needs like maintaining energy levels or overall well-being. 

Overall, while the ad is moderately positive in its messaging, my reserved nature and current priorities result in a cautious evaluation with low immediate purchase intent but some openness to future consideration.
