**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like:* Neutral (3) – The ad isn't particularly exciting but doesn’t turn me off.
  - *Interesting:* Agree (4) – It’s mildly engaging, especially the promise of staying energized and looking good daily.
  - *Good:* Strongly Agree (5) – I find the messaging appealing for a professional lifestyle; it aligns with maintaining efficiency and appearance.
  - *Attractive:* Disagree (2) – The presentation might lack creativity or strong emotional appeal, making it less visually attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to Purchase:* Strongly Disagree (1) – While the ad presents a good value proposition, my current routine and budget preferences may not support an immediate purchase.
  - *Try to Buy:* Disagree (2) – There's no strong motivation or urgency, so I'm unlikely to make efforts towards buying it soon.
  - *Consider Buying:* Neutral (3) – It stays on the radar for future consideration if there are specific needs that match its benefits.

Overall, though some aspects of the ad resonate with my values and professional mindset, factors like personal routine consistency and current financial constraints lower my immediate purchase intent.
