**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - I find it somewhat neutral but not particularly appealing.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - It holds some interest as a concept, though not strongly engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - It's not convincing; the messaging feels generic and lacks specific details about benefits.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Slightly above neutral but still unimpressive; it doesnâ€™t stand out visually or emotionally.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree, as I don't feel compelled by the advertisement.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Also strongly disagree; no drive towards a trial from the given ad.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning slightly toward consideration but with minimal impact.

Overall, while I recognize its attempt at prevention messaging, it falls short in terms of persuasion and relevance to my needs as an informed consumer, hence low scores across both attitude and purchase intention categories.
