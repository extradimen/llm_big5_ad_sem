**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) — The energy boost aspect aligns with my daily needs, but it doesn't overly excite me.
  - **Interesting:** Moderately agree (3) — It's not groundbreaking or unique enough to captivate me entirely.
  - **Good Advertisement:** Agree slightly above neutral (5) — It conveys its message clearly and professionally.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — The appeal is limited; I prefer ads with more tangible benefits or personal relevance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Somewhat inclined but not certain (3)
  - **Try to Buy:** Considered, possibly for short-term use (3)
  - **Consider Buying:** Mildly positive leaning (4) — Given my busy managerial role and need for energy, it's on the radar.

Overall, while I appreciate its functional claims and professional presentation, personal engagement isn't strong enough to drive an immediate purchase decision. The ad is effective in being informative but lacks a compelling emotional connection or differentiation that might sway me more significantly.
