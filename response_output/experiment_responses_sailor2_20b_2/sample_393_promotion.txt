**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (5/7)**: Despite being talkative and sociable, I find the message slightly generic.
2. **Interesting (3/7)**: The energy aspect is overused in advertising; it doesn't stand out as unique or compelling enough for me.
3. **Believe the ad is good (4/7)**: It seems credible due to clear benefits mentioned but lacks emotional engagement or personal relevance.
4. **Attractive (2/7)**: Given my strong agree on talkativeness and sometimes rude behavior, I prefer more dynamic and impactful visual or textual content.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (1/7)**: Even with a postgraduate degree working in blue-collar, staying energized is important; however, the ad doesn't convince me this product uniquely addresses my needs.
2. **Try to buy (2/7)**: Mild curiosity but not enough persuasion due to its generic approach and lack of specific benefits I value.
3. **Consider buying (2/7)**: Willingly entertain it in the future if there's more tailored communication or special offers, but initial inclination is low.

Overall, while acknowledging utility for energy, this ad fails to resonate personally given my critical personality traits, emotional concerns, and preference for originality over generic promises. Thus, despite neutral-to-mildly favorable attitudes, purchase intention remains low.
