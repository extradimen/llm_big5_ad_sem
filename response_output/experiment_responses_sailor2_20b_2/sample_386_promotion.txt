**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): Neutral but slightly positive. The appeal to staying energized resonates with my daily grind as an office worker.
  - Think it's interesting (Score: 4): Agreeable; energy drinks are commonplace, so while not novel, they intrigue due to personal relevance.
  - Believe the ad is good (Score: 5): Neutral leaning towards agree. The message of looking your best aligns with general self-care goals but feels somewhat generic.
  - Find it attractive (Score: 2): Disagree; lack of originality and overuse of similar claims make it less compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1, Strongly disagree): Given my reserved nature, Iâ€™m not inclined to act impulsively. Regular office drink routines are well-established.
  - Will try to buy this product (Score: 1, Strongly disagree): No immediate desire or necessity; current options suffice.
  - Consider buying the product (Score: 2, Neutral leaning towards negative): Might consider if offered discounts or unique benefits that justify my limited budget and skeptical nature about marketing claims. 

Overall, while I appreciate the message's relevance to daily routines, the ad falls short in compelling me personally due to its generalizability and lack of distinctive value proposition for someone like myself who prioritizes authenticity and practicality over flashy promises.
