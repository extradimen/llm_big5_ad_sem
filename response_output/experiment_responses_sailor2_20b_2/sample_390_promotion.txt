**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *Like:* Given my reserved nature and preference for practicality over flashy ads, the overall tone feels less appealing (2).
  - *Interesting:* While it's not gripping, the dual benefit (energized & looking good) could catch some attention (3).
  - *Good:* The message is clear but lacks depth to resonate deeply with my values and daily concerns (4).
  - *Attractive:* It has potential appeal due to its universal promise of enhancement, though it's not compelling enough for strong attraction (5).

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - *Intend:* As a blue-collar worker with limited income, the cost-effectiveness isn't emphasized, making an immediate purchase intention low (1).
  - *Try/Buy*: The idea is somewhat intriguing; hence, I might consider giving it a try but not as a high priority (2-3).

Overall, while acknowledging its potential benefits, this ad falls short in connecting deeply with my personality and practical needs. Hence, though moderately interesting, the intention to purchase remains low due to economic constraints and lack of strong motivational appeal.
