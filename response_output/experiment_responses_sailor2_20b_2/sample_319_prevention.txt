**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While not strongly positive, it resonates with a hint of usefulness regarding fatigue and appearance.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The idea seems relevant to daily struggles but doesn't captivate intensely.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards skepticism; needs more credibility for trust.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - Somewhat appealing due to concern over energy levels and looks, but not highly persuasive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; doesn't evoke immediate action or trust in efficacy.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Disagree leaning towards neutral; might consider a trial if convinced by additional information elsewhere.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Neutral but open-minded; would need more reassurance about its effectiveness and cost alignment with personal budget.

Overall, while the ad presents relevant concerns, my reserved nature combined with skepticism towards marketing claims limits enthusiasm for purchasing without further evidence or recommendations from trusted sources.
