**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (score 3) - The claim to stay energized and look your best is appealing but lacks a personal connection for someone in my demographic.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree with some interest (score 4) - It’s somewhat engaging, particularly as energy drinks are common among blue-collar workers needing stamina.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Somewhat positive (score 5) - The concept of staying energized aligns loosely with my needs but seems too general for a strong belief in its effectiveness.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral leaning toward negative (score 2) - It lacks relatability to someone like me, especially since it focuses on appearance more than practical benefits.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score 1) - Despite needing energy, my budget constraints and skepticism about the long-term value make a direct purchase unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (score 1) - Given my cautious nature and financial limits, trying out an expensive drink is not feasible.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral leaning toward consideration (score 3) - I may entertain the idea if there’s a significant promotion or discount, but it's not top of mind right now.

In summary, while the ad has some superficial appeal, practical concerns about cost and relevance overshadow its potential benefits for someone with my profile. Thus, purchase intent is minimal unless compelling conditions are met.
