**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate its purpose but find it somewhat generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - Slightly below average; it lacks unique selling points that grab my attention as a civil servant with limited leisure time.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2/7):**
   - Disagree; while energy drinks are common, this claim feels too broad and unconvincing without specific benefits or proof.

4. **I find the ad attractive (5/7):**
   - Agreeable; visual appeal may be decent but fails to resonate deeply due to limited personal relevance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (1/7):** 
   - Strongly Disagree; given my cautious, cost-conscious nature and low income, the perceived value isn't compelling enough.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (2/7):**
   - Slightly Agree; curiosity might lead me to consider a small sample if there's an affordable trial offer.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3/7):**
   - Neutral-leaning Positive; open-minded but won't prioritize it over necessities, especially without substantial evidence of effectiveness or cost efficiency.

In summary, while the ad has some positive aspects in terms of appearance and general appeal, its lack of specific benefits and relevance to my lifestyle reduce overall engagement. Purchase intentions remain low due to practical constraints and cautious attitude towards new products.
