**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **Like (Score: 4)**: The ad's promise of energy and appearance benefits is somewhat appealing due to my active lifestyle as a civil servant.
    - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: While it holds some interest, I find myself more engaged with ads focusing on reliability or trustworthiness than mere promises about looks.
    - **Good (Score: 2.5)**: It lacks depth and specifics that would make me fully believe in its claims; credibility could be improved.
    - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The concept is moderately attractive, but it doesnâ€™t strongly resonate given my strong preference for thorough information.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 3)**: I'm not immediately compelled by the ad alone. My decision would be influenced more by product reviews and brand trust.
    - **Try to Buy (Score: 2.5)**: There's a mild inclination to give it a try if there are favorable testimonials or promotions, but not enough on its own.
    - **Consider Buying (Score: 3)**: It sparks consideration, especially when balanced with other factors like pricing and efficacy.

In summary, while the ad captures some attention due to my sociable nature and desire for energy boosters, it doesn't meet high standards of credibility or emotional appeal. Therefore, a cautious but open mindset towards potential purchase is maintained.
