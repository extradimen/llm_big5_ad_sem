**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3/7):** While I appreciate the energy and wellness theme, it's not exceptionally engaging.
   - **Interesting (2/7):** The promise of staying energized is generic; doesn't stand out enough for me.
   - **Good (4/7):** It effectively communicates basic benefits but lacks unique selling points or credibility factors.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Visually and conceptually, it falls short in capturing my attention due to common tropes.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (3/7):** Despite needing energy support, the ad doesn't compel me enough for an immediate purchase decision.
   - **Try (3/7):** There's some curiosity but not strong motivation; I might be open to a sample or discounted trial offer.
   - **Consider (5/7):** The idea aligns with my wellness goals, so it warrants consideration alongside other options in future.

In summary, the ad is serviceable but lacks depth and personal connection. While I value its message, the presentation doesn't fully resonate given my personality traits and current circumstances. Thus, while not strongly disliked, neither does it drive a high purchase intent on its own merits.
