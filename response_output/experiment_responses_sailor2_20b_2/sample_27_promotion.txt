**Evaluation and Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it doesn't strongly resonate with me. As a senior civil servant focused on reliability rather than glamour.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The idea seems engaging due to its promise but is not exceptionally intriguing given my neutral-to-skeptical nature about such claims.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: I perceive the ad as generally positive and well-intentioned, though it lacks a strong emotional connection for me personally.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: It does not stand out visually or emotionally to draw significant attention; my reserved personality leans towards more substantial messaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (Score: 1)**: Given my tendency toward thoroughness and skepticism, I wouldn't be inclined to purchase immediately without concrete evidence of effectiveness.
   - **Try (Score: 3)**: There's a moderate curiosity driven by the "energized" aspect, but not enough trust or urgency to make an immediate trial. 
   - **Consider (Score: 2)**: Though I acknowledge it as plausible for others, my cautious and somewhat careless nature makes me less likely to actively consider this purchase in the short term.

In summary, while open-minded about wellness products, this ad doesn't evoke a strong enough response or sense of urgency due to personal values, preferences, and skepticism. Therefore, low scores reflect a balanced yet restrained approach towards both liking the advertisement and buying intent.
