**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - **I like the ad (4):** The message is clear and relatable, but I'm not overly enthusiastic about it.
   - **Interesting (5):** It does grab my attention by highlighting common issues of fatigue and appearance, making me curious to learn more details.
   - **Believe good (6):** While there’s some credibility in suggesting the drink can help prevent tiredness and dull looks, I need more evidence for full belief.
   - **Attractive (3):** The ad appeals to my desire for staying alert but is not highly visually or emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - **Intend to purchase (2):** While the concept resonates, there isn’t enough trust or incentive at this point to actively plan a purchase.
   - **Try to buy (3):** I might give it a chance if I see positive reviews or promotions, reflecting my cautious yet open-minded approach.
   - **Consider buying (4):** It’s definitely on the list of potential purchases given its direct connection with daily well-being.

In summary, though not strongly persuaded by the ad, it's positioned to be considered and perhaps tried out based on personal experience and further validation.
