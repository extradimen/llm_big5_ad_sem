**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like (3/7):** The ad plays on potential fatigue and appearance concerns but doesn't resonate strongly due to its generic nature.
  - **Interesting (4/7):** It captures attention briefly, making it somewhat interesting, especially for those who prioritize energy levels and looks. However, the message lacks depth or novelty.
  - **Good (2/7):** While basic needs are addressed, I find the argument unconvincing without additional supporting evidence or a compelling brand story.
  - **Attractive (3/7):** The ad is moderately attractive but not enough to engage my reserved and non-helpful nature. It feels somewhat manipulative in its tone.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (2/7):** My strong disagreement with being unselfish makes me less likely to prioritize such a product unless it's personally essential.
  - **Try (2/7):** With my high income, I might experiment if presented in the right context or by trusted sources. Otherwise, initial interest is low.
  - **Consider (3/7):** The neutral score indicates that while not strongly opposed, neither am I convinced enough to immediately buy. It will depend on future encounters and perceived necessity.

In summary, this ad falls short of compelling me due to its lack of depth in communication and alignment with my reserved, non-helpful personality traits, resulting in moderate engagement but minimal purchase intent.
