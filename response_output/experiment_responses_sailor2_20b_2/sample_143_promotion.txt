**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
  - **Like (Score = 5):** The ad's promise of staying energized aligns with daily routines but doesn't strongly excite me.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** Neutral to slightly interesting, as the concept is common in energy drink ads. No unique appeal.
  - **Good (Score = 6):** Positively conveys benefits; I value staying productive and looking good, so it generally seems like a good idea.
  - **Attractive (Score = 3):** The messaging lacks personal resonance or emotional connection for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score = 2):** Neutral-to-disagree. Although the benefits are appealing, there isn't strong motivation given my usual routine and other beverage choices.
  - **Try to Buy (Score = 1):** Strongly disagree; I'm not inclined to make a special effort for this product without compelling reasons or discounts.
  - **Consider Buying (Score = 2):** Neutral-to-disagree. While it’s on the radar, my current preferences and budget limit immediate consideration.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad positive, it doesn’t fully engage me emotionally or prompt a strong purchase intent due to neutral engagement, lack of novelty, and existing product choices.
