**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 4)
   - While I appreciate that it aims to convey benefits, my neutral-to-negative personality traits (e.g., sometimes rude and careless) don't find the presentation particularly appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3)
   - It's generic enough but not innovative for me; hence, just moderately interesting due to the common claims of energy and appearance benefits.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5)
   - The message seems well-intentioned, focusing on practical aspects like stamina and looks, which align with basic consumer needs even if they don't stir personal excitement.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)
   - Being less sociable and outgoing, I'm not drawn to its overtly positive or energetic tone; it lacks emotional appeal for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1)
   - Despite my monthly income being sufficient, the high price point combined with skepticism about such claims makes a strong intent unlikely given my cost-consciousness and critical nature.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1)
   - No compelling reason exists in the ad for me to proactively seek out or prioritize trying it over other alternatives that better match my reserved, practical preferences.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 1)
   - Even if I'm open-minded, without additional incentives (such as a discount or personal endorsement), I'm highly unlikely to seriously weigh purchasing based on the ad alone.

In summary, while acknowledging its utility benefits, my personality and preferences lead me to find the advertisement somewhat lacking in appeal and ultimately unconvincing for actual purchase consideration.
