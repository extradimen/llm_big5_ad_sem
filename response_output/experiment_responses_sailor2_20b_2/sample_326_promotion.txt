**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the ad (2)**: Given my reserved nature and preference for straightforward messages over overly energetic ones, I find it slightly disagreeable.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The claim of staying energized appeals somewhat but doesn't spark high interest due to neutral trust level and low imagination tendency.
   - **Believe is good (4)**: It resonates on a moderate level as energy drinks are generally understood for their benefits, even if I'm not an active consumer myself.
   - **Attractive (3)**: Neutral attractiveness since it doesn't align perfectly with my values or lifestyle.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (2)**: Strongly disagree because, despite the appeal, daily use of energy drinks isn't part of my routine.
   - **Try to buy (3)**: Neutral intent; I might consider giving it a try but not with full commitment.
   - **Consider buying (4)**: Willing to evaluate based on personal needs and possibly occasional usage, reflecting neutral trust combined with the desire for new ideas.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat appealing due to its focus on practical benefits, my reserved nature and cautious approach keep my purchase intention moderate. I am open but not enthusiastic about trying it out.
