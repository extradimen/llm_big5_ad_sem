**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude (Scores):**
   - *Like the Ad*: Agree (Score = 4) — The concept of avoiding fatigue and appearing more lively is appealing, aligning with my active lifestyle as a civil servant.
   - *Interesting*: Neutral (Score = 3) — While not groundbreaking, it does grab attention because energy levels are a common concern among working adults.
   - *Believe the Ad is Good*: Agree (Score = 4) — The message seems credible and practical for daily well-being.
   - *Attractive*: Agree (Score = 5) — Visually appealing design and straightforward messaging make it an attractive choice.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Moderate agreement (2). While interested, there are other options I might already use or consider first.
   - *Try to Buy*: Considered (3). The ad prompts curiosity but doesn't guarantee immediate action; I'll observe further before making a decision.
   - *Consider Buying*: Strongly considered (4). Given my work-related fatigue and desire for improved energy, it's on the radar as an option.

In summary, though not overly persuasive to spur an instant purchase, this ad effectively raises awareness of its benefits and earns consideration, reflecting both my sociable nature and cautious approach towards new products.
