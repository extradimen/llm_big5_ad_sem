**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad:** 3 (Neutral) – The product's benefits are appealing but don't excite me.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** 4 (Agree) – It’s engaging enough to hold my attention briefly.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** 5 (Strongly Agree) – While not perfect, it effectively communicates its core message about energy and appearance.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** 2 (Disagree) – The overall aesthetic doesn't particularly appeal to me given my reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) – My current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and priority on necessities make it unlikely.
  - **I will try to buy this product:** 2 (Disagree) – There's limited urgency or strong motivation given my stable routine and budget limitations.
  - **I will consider buying this product:** 3 (Neutral/Agree slightly)—While not a top consideration, I might look into it further if the benefits align well with occasional needs.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad’s positive aspects, personal values like being reserved, financial constraints, and prioritizing essential expenditures prevent strong purchase intention. The ad is appreciated but falls short of compelling me to act immediately or significantly influencing my lifestyle choices at this stage in life.
