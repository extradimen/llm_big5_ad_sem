**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
    - **Like (2)**: While I acknowledge its aim to address fatigue and dullness, my reserved nature means it doesn't captivate me strongly.
    - **Interesting (3)**: The message is straightforward but lacks creativity or emotional depth that resonates with me.
    - **Good (4)**: It’s factually correct in warning about potential consequences of not using the drink. However, its simplicity and lack of a compelling hook make it somewhat average.
    - **Attractive (1)**: Given my strong Agree to getting nervous easily and worrying a lot, I find this generic ad more anxiety-inducing than appealing.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to Purchase (1)**: Despite acknowledging the product's potential benefits, personal preference for thoroughness doesn't translate into an immediate purchase decision due to uninspired presentation.
    - **Try to Buy (1)**: No compelling drive to act on this ad; other factors would need consideration before making a trial purchase.
    - **Consider Buying (2)**: There’s a slight incline in curiosity but not enough for serious contemplation, particularly without further detailed information or trust-building elements. 

Overall, while the message is clear and relevant, its execution fails to connect with my preferences and emotional state. Thus, it results in low appeal and purchase intention scores.
