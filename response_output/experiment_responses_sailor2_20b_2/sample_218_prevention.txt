**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad**:  
   *Score: 5* - While I don't find it overly appealing due to my reserved nature (Strongly Agree), the clear emphasis on fatigue prevention resonates somewhat.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**:
   *Score: 4* - The message about looking dull and feeling tired could grab attention briefly, but my strong appreciation for logic over emotional cues makes it less compelling.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good**:
   *Score: 3.5* - It presents a valid problem (tiredness), which can be effective in marketing health products; however, I'm skeptical about its effectiveness without further proof.

4. **I find the ad attractive**:  
   *Score: 3* - My reserved and cautious personality means it doesn't strongly attract me, especially given my distrust (Strongly Disagree) towards such straightforward promises.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product**:
   *Score: 2* - Although the ad's message is pertinent, I need more concrete evidence or personal experiences before committing an intent to buy.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**:
   *Score: 1.5* - Given my skepticism and careful nature (Strongly Agree), I'm unlikely to take action without further assurances of efficacy.

3. **I will consider buying this product**:
   *Score: 2.5* - The ad sparks mild curiosity, making me open to investigating the drink more thoroughly if offered in a credible context or during a sale period.

In summary, while acknowledging its relevance and potential benefit (especially for fatigue), my reserved yet thorough nature leads to moderate interest without high commitment levels. A stronger focus on trust-building evidence would likely improve both ad appeal and purchase intention scores.
