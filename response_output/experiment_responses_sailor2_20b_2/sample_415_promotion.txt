**Evaluation Details:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral — While not inherently negative, it doesn't align with my talkative and outgoing nature; I expect more dynamic messaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree — The claims are generic and lack creativity or personal relevance for me as a civil servant in Southeast Asia.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Disagree — It lacks credibility, especially since it doesn't address specific benefits or challenges I face (e.g., work stress vs. just energy levels).
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree — The visual and verbal appeal seems too broad to resonate with my preferences for authenticity over superficial promises.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree — Despite being in a high-stress job, I prioritize products backed by detailed evidence rather than vague claims.
2. **Will try to buy the product:** Strongly Disagree — No compelling reason or unique selling point makes me want to test it; my skepticism outweighs curiosity.
3. **Consider buying this product:** Disagree — Given past experiences with similar promises, I am unlikely to consider purchasing unless provided additional, substantial information.

In summary, while not explicitly opposed to the concept of energy drinks, the advertisement falls short in engaging and persuading me due to its lack of personal relevance, credibility, and distinctive features. Consequently, my purchase intention remains low despite being in a demographic that could benefit from such products.
