**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Attitude Scores):**
   - **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score = 3)  
     As a reserved individual who values thoroughness but is not particularly talkative or outgoing, I don’t find the energetic and glamorous presentation overly appealing.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to Agree (Score = 4)
     It’s engaging in terms of promises about energy levels and appearance, which can grab attention momentarily.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral with lean towards Agree (Score = 5)  
     The message seems well-crafted but doesn't align deeply enough with my conservative trust instincts or everyday needs.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score = 3)
     While visually appealing, it lacks strong emotional connection given my reserved nature and skepticism about exaggerated claims.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Somewhat Neutral/Disagree (Score = 2)  
     The promise of energy boost is tempting but not compelling enough due to reservations on credibility.
   - **Will try to buy the product:** Consideration Level (Score = 2)
     Given my meticulous nature, I may look into customer reviews and further details before making a purchase decision.
   - **Will consider buying the product:** Mild Consideration (Score = 3)  
     The combination of practical need for energy with cautious consumer behavior means I'll keep it in mind but not rush to buy.

Overall, while intrigued by its potential benefits, my reserved nature and critical thinking lead me to a moderately favorable ad evaluation without strong intent to purchase immediately. This balanced perspective reflects both the appeal's limits and my calculated approach as an office worker balancing practicality with skepticism.
