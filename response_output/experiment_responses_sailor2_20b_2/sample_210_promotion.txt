**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *Like (2)*: While the ad seems appealing on paper for its energy and beauty promises, my reserved nature makes me less likely to be enthusiastic about it.
  - *Interesting (3)*: It catches attention briefly but doesn't grab long-term interest due to personal lifestyle priorities.
  - *Good (4)*: Conceptually good, focusing on wellness; however, perceived relevance is moderate given daily challenges and budget constraints.
  - *Attractive (3)*: Visually and conceptually attractive, yet not compelling enough for strong engagement.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
  - *Intend to Purchase (1)*: Strongly disagree due to financial limitations (<15,000,000 VND per month), which means prioritizing essentials over luxury items.
  - *Try Buying (2)*: Neutral-to-disagree because trying the product doesn't align with my cautious and sometimes careless nature in spending habits.
  - *Consider Buying (2)*: Marginally consider purchasing if it were highly affordable, but current financial situation rules out serious consideration.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's positive attributes, personal traits like frugality, reservation, and practicality lead to a low likelihood of purchase.
