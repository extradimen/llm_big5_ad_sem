**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral to Positive (4): The claim about tiredness and dull appearance is relatable, but it doesn’t strongly resonate as I might already be aware of these issues without needing a specific drink.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (5): The concept has some intrigue because addressing fatigue directly appeals to anyone's desire for energy.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (6): It’s well-crafted and makes a clear, relevant point, which adds credibility.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree/Neutral (3): While it’s effective in its message, I might not be swayed solely by its appearance or emotional appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral/Tentative (2): The ad persuades, but other factors like price, brand loyalty, and previous experiences also matter.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Tentative/Considering (3): I'm open to giving it a shot if the cost aligns with my budget and there are positive reviews or recommendations from peers.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral/Tentative (2): Even though not strongly committed, it’s on my radar for future evaluation.

Overall, while the ad is effective in presenting its message, other factors play a significant role in influencing my actual purchase decision as a blue-collar worker with specific lifestyle and budget constraints.
