**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 4)**  
    While I appreciate its attempt to address fatigue and appearance, it feels a bit cliché. However, as someone in my age group who values staying active, this concern resonates somewhat.

- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**  
    It's not groundbreaking but highlights common daily issues which can draw attention for potential benefits of the product.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**  
    The message lacks depth and isn't particularly compelling. It could benefit from more substantial evidence or a unique angle to stand out.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**  
    Visual appeal might be okay, but its simplistic messaging doesn’t strongly draw me in emotionally or logically.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**  
    Strongly disagree. Despite understanding fatigue issues, I need more compelling reasons and trustworthiness from the brand before considering a purchase.

- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**  
    Slightly agree; curiosity might prompt me to check reviews or talk with peers but not enough motivation for an immediate trial.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**  
    Neutral-to-agree. The ad raises awareness, so I may give it some thought if other factors (like discounts or endorsements) align positively.

Overall, while the advertisement taps into relevant concerns and is mildly interesting, its lack of persuasive depth limits both immediate intent to buy and overall attractiveness as a compelling message for someone like me with strong preference for thoroughness in decision-making.
