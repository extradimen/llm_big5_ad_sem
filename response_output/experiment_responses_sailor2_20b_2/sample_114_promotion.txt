**Evaluation Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **Like (Score: 4):** The catchy energy promise might appeal slightly, but it feels too generic.
- **Interesting (Score: 3):** While engaging to some extent due to the energetic theme, not groundbreaking for my demographic and needs.
- **Good (Score: 2):** Lacks depth in claims; I need more specifics on health benefits or scientific backing.
- **Attractive (Score: 2):** The visuals may draw attention, but overall attractiveness is low given its overused marketing message.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend to Purchase:** Despite mild interest, strong disagreement with being helpful/unselfish and general trust issues make me skeptical about wellness products.
- **Try to Buy:** Neutral planning tendencies mean I'm not actively seeking new products but might consider trying if presented in a more trustworthy manner.
- **Consider Buying (Score: 1):** Low likelihood of purchase due to lackluster ad credibility, emotional instability, and the overwhelming number of similar offers on the market.

Overall, while the ad has some superficial appeal, it falls short on deeper engagement or trust-building necessary for me to make a meaningful purchase decision.
