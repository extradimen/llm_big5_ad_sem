**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: (Score = 4) - While I appreciate its attempt to highlight potential drawbacks of not using the product, it doesn't resonate deeply with me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: (Score = 3) - The concept isn’t novel enough given my personality; hence, it only holds moderate interest.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: (Score = 5) - It effectively conveys a problem statement but falls short on emotional connection and originality due to common prevention messaging.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: (Score = 2) - The visual appeal or creative execution isn't compelling, making it less engaging for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: (Score = 1) - Strongly Disagree — Despite recognizing potential issues, my current routines and lifestyle don’t drive an immediate need.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: (Score = 2) — While I might be slightly curious, there's no strong motivation to act right now.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: (Score = 3) — It’s mildly on my radar but not a priority; further information or context could shift the consideration level.

Given my preference for thoroughness and emotional stability being low, an ad must offer more compelling reasons or personal relevance to sway me towards purchase intent. This one falls short of those criteria.
