**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) — The ad seems somewhat appealing, but not particularly engaging for me given my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — It captures attention by highlighting the potential downsides of feeling tired or looking dull, which resonates slightly.
  - **Good:** Disagree (2) — I find it a bit generic and cliché; no strong emotional connection.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (1) — The ad isn't visually compelling nor does it inspire trust in the product’s unique value.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** 2 (Somewhat Agree, Neutral Tendency)
    - While I acknowledge the issues highlighted, my limited budget and strong agreement on thorough job performance make me hesitant.
  - **Try to Buy:** 1 (Disagree)
    - Given other priorities and financial constraints, there’s low likelihood of actively seeking out this product.
  - **Consider Buying:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    - The lackluster appeal combined with practical limitations means it doesn’t rank high on my consideration list.

In summary, while I find the ad moderately interesting due to its direct messaging about fatigue and appearance, personal values around budget consciousness, thoroughness in actions, and reserved nature lead me towards a cautious stance toward purchasing this product. Therefore, low scores reflect both an indifferent attitude and limited purchase intention.
