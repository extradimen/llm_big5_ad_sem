**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like the ad*: Neutral (4) – While it's not unappealing, I'm somewhat reserved and prefer more substance.
   - *Interesting*: Agree (5) – The promise of staying energized appeals to my practical side, especially as a civil servant with daily demands.
   - *Good Advertisement*: Strongly Agree (6) – It effectively communicates benefits important for modern lifestyle balance but needs better credibility backing.
   - *Attractive*: Disagree (3) – The claim "look your best" feels superficial; it resonates less given my personal focus on functional rather than cosmetic results.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Disagree (2) – While the ad is decent, I'm cautious about making purchases based solely on energetic claims without further evidence.
   - *Try to Buy*: Neutral (3) – There's a slight curiosity driven by its alignment with my routine, but no immediate impulse buy.
   - *Consider Buying*: Somewhat Neutral/Neutral Tendency (4) – It moves me closer to considering the product if I see customer reviews or additional benefits supporting daily performance.

Overall, the ad is moderately persuasive due to functional utility but falls short on emotional depth and credibility for a potentially significant purchase decision. My strong values of helpfulness and thoroughness drive my neutral-to-positive engagement without an immediate commitment.
