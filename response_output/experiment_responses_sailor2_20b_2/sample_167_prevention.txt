**Evaluation Explanation:**
1. **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
   - **2 (Like)**: As someone who values thoroughness but is generally reserved, the ad feels mildly engaging without overwhelming.
   - **3 (Interesting)**: The straightforward message about fatigue resonates slightly since it's relatable to daily life stressors and academic demands.
   - **4 (Good)**: It meets my criteria for credibility by addressing a common problem directly, appealing to practical needs.
   - **3 (Attractive)**: Slight attractiveness due to its targeted appeal yet not overly flashy or intrusive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - **2 (Intend)**: Though the ad is compelling, I’m cautious about new products; intention leans towards consideration rather than immediate purchase.
   - **2 (Try)**: Willingness to give it a try but with reservations due to personal tendency toward unselfish caution and my financial constraints.
   - **3 (Consider)**: Overall, considering the benefits mentioned for energy levels during demanding study hours makes me open-minded towards purchasing. 

Balancing realism against health concerns aligns well within this scoring framework. The ad successfully prompts interest but doesn’t guarantee an immediate purchase decision given my reserved nature and cautious approach to new products.
