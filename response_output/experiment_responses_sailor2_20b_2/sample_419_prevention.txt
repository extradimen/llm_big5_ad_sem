**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like**: Neutral (`4`) — The ad is not exceptionally appealing but does its job.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (`5`) — It catches my attention with a clear message about energy and appearance.
  - **Good**: Strongly Agree (`6`) — The prevention-focused approach resonates well, suggesting the drink can improve daily performance and self-perception.
  - **Attractive**: Slightly Attractive (`3`) — While not overly attractive visually or emotionally, it’s effective in making a functional appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral leaning towards Agree (`2`/low) — I acknowledge the benefits but don't feel an immediate need.
  - **Try to Buy**: Consideration (Slightly Positive; `3`) — It’s worth giving it a try, especially if fatigue is a concern.
  - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Consider (`5`) — Given my preference for preventive health measures and active lifestyle, I would seriously consider adding this product.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates its message but falls short in generating immediate purchase intent. My sociable nature helps me appreciate practical wellness solutions, leading to a strong consideration score while maintaining realistic expectations on buying intention.
