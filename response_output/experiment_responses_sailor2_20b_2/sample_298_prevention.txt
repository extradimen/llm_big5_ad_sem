**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 3* (Neutral)
   - While I appreciate the message about combating tiredness and looking dull, it doesn’t resonate strongly enough given my personal preferences.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 4* (Somewhat Agree)
   - The claim holds some appeal but falls short of being captivating due to its common nature in health drink advertisements.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 5* (Agree)
   - It conveys a clear benefit, which aligns with my values and desire for well-being.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3* (Neutral)
   - Although not visually or emotionally striking, it does meet basic expectations of an effective health-focused advertisement.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2* (Slightly Disagree)
   - The persuasive power is limited; I prefer products with proven track records and personalized relevance.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 2* (Slightly Disagree)
   - There’s a slight inclination, but not enough motivation based on the ad alone.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 3* (Neutral/Consider)
   - I might weigh it against other options since well-being is important to me; however, additional information or personal endorsement could sway my decision further.

Overall, while acknowledging its effectiveness in highlighting key benefits, the ad doesn't fully align with my cautious and slightly skeptical nature. My purchase intention leans more towards "consideration" rather than immediate action due to a balanced mix of interest and skepticism regarding new product claims.
