**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
1. **I like the ad:** Agree with a score of 6 - The messaging is clear and resonates well; it addresses common feelings like tiredness and dull appearance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral leaning towards agree, scored as 5 - It presents an immediate need that many people can relate to, making it engaging but not overly creative or surprising.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly below neutral at 4.5 - While well-intentioned and logical, the simplicity may lack emotional depth, particularly for those who seek more sophisticated marketing approaches.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Lean towards disagree (scored as 3.5) – The straightforward nature can come across as overly utilitarian or even a bit dull to someone with an active imagination and artistic interests.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Score of 2 - Despite liking the ad, it doesn't create strong enough emotional attachment or perceived necessity without further information on benefits.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Slightly lower at 1.5 – There is some curiosity but not a firm commitment; would need additional reviews, endorsements, or special promotions.

3. **Consider buying the product:** Score of 2 - Open mindset for future consideration based on personal experience or more compelling reasons such as health benefits beyond just appearance and energy levels.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s clarity and relevance to common issues, it falls short in terms of emotional engagement and long-term motivation for purchase. The strong points (like thoroughness, following through with plans) align well with its practical message but aren't sufficient to drive an immediate buy decision. Additional brand differentiation or compelling proof points could enhance both the ad's appeal and my intent to purchase.
