**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - **Like (4)**: While I find the ad's concept somewhat relatable due to its emphasis on fatigue and appearance, it doesn't strongly resonate.
  - **Interesting (5)**: The claim of avoiding tiredness is intriguing; however, it needs more compelling evidence for higher engagement.
  - **Good (3)**: Neutral leaning towards a bit positive. It adequately addresses common concerns but lacks depth or creativity that would make me consider it top-notch.
  - **Attractive (2)**: Not very attractive to my tastes as the message feels somewhat generic and unoriginal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
  - **Intend (3)**: Though understanding fatigue is important, I'm not highly motivated enough to commit fully to buying this product based on a single ad.
  - **Try (2)**: Given some curiosity but practicality first; might give it a try if the price and brand are reasonable.
  - **Consider (1)**: Generally low intent because of limited appeal in an already saturated market, despite addressing common issues.

Overall, while I acknowledge the relevance to my lifestyle, the ad falls short on emotional engagement and unique value proposition. Thus, moderate interest but minimal intention towards purchase without further compelling factors.
