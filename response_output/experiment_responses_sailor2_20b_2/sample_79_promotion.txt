**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score: 5)
   - The claim of being energized and looking good is appealing but not particularly exciting for someone focused on daily tasks.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Mildly Agree (Score: 4) 
   - It piques interest, especially if you're occasionally tired or self-conscious about appearance, but lacks novelty.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral to Slightly Negative (Score: 3)
   - The benefits sound plausible, but it doesn't resonate strongly given my practical perspective and limited disposable income.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Mildly Agree (Score: 4)
   - Visually appealing or catchy slogans could make me stop for a moment, but no strong pull.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Slightly Disagree (Score: 2)
   - While useful features are noted, my limited budget (<15 million VND) and current needs don't justify the cost without more urgency or special offers.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Neutral with Tendency Toward Yes (Score: 3)
   - There's a small inclination due to potential benefits but not enough drive to actively seek out purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Disagree (Score: 1) 
   - Given my conservative spending habits and other priorities, it wonâ€™t be on top of the list without further incentives or personal necessity.

Overall, while the advertisement presents a relevant message for wellness-conscious individuals, its persuasive impact is limited by practical considerations like affordability and immediate relevance to current needs. A well-executed discount promotion or alignment with monthly budgets might sway my intent more positively.
