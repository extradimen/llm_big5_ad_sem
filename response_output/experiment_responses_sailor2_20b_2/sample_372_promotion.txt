**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** 5
     * The claim of staying energized resonates well with my active lifestyle but feels a bit clichéd.
   - **Interesting:** 4
     * It’s not groundbreaking, given the market saturation of energy drinks and beauty aids.
   - **Believe it's good:** 6 
     * While I appreciate its promise to look great every day, this might be slightly over-promising for real results.
   - **Attractive:** 3
     * The overall design and messaging are neutral; not particularly compelling given my personality.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
   - **Intend to purchase:** 2 
     * Strongly agree on staying energized, but I prioritize healthier options like green tea or balanced diet.
   - **Try the product:** 3
     * Curiosity is there due to my sociable nature and desire for variety; might try it once out of novelty. 
   - **Consider buying:** 2 
     * Regular purchase intent low because other, more reliable energy strategies align better with long-term goals.

In summary, while the ad has some appeal in theory, its messaging is neither unique nor strongly aligned with my personalized health and lifestyle preferences, resulting in moderate interest but minimal intention to make a regular commitment.
