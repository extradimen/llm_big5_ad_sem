**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - *Like*: Neutral (2) — It doesn't particularly appeal or repel me.
  - *Interesting*: Disagree (3) — The claims are generic and don’t capture my interest.
  - *Good*: Neutral (4) — Neither convincingly positive nor negative, just neutral in value.
  - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree (1) — It feels irrelevant to my reserved personality.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase:* Disagree (2) — There's no strong motivation or urgency from the ad.
  - *Try to buy:* Neutral (3) — Open to giving it a try if other factors align, but not committed.
  - *Consider buying:* Agree (4) — It remains on my radar for future consideration despite initial lack of attraction.

Overall, while I acknowledge its presence and might give the product a chance in appropriate situations, the ad fails to strongly resonate with my reserved nature or immediate needs.
