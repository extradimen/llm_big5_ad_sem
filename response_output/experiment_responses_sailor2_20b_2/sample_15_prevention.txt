**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*
   - Despite being talkative and outgoing, the overtly persuasive tone feels somewhat manipulative.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)* 
   - It's mildly engaging but lacks originality or a strong emotional hook to captivate me fully.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 4 (Slightly Agree)*
   - The messaging about feeling tired and looking dull connects with common experiences, making it somewhat believable.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* 
   - The appeal falls flat due to its generic nature; I prefer ads that offer more engaging or unique insights.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*
   - While the health concerns addressed are valid, other factors like brand reputation and personal habits would significantly influence my decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)* 
   - Minimal intent based on current evaluation; I'm unlikely to make an immediate purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - There's a small window for consideration if the product aligns with future wellness goals or after further research, but not strong enough to act impulsively.

In summary, while acknowledging some merit in addressing common concerns, the ad fails to deeply resonate due to its lack of creativity and overly manipulative delivery. Thus, it scores low on attractiveness and purchase intent despite general believability.
