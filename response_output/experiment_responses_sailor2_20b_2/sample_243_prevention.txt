**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (score 3): Although somewhat neutral, it doesn't strongly resonate with my outgoing and sociable nature.
  - The ad is interesting (score 4): It has a compelling message, but not exceptionally engaging due to its directness about fatigue and appearance.
  - The ad is good (score 5): It presents the benefits clearly, aligning well with my belief in helpful products. However, it doesn't evoke strong positive emotions.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 2): While visually appealing might be present, it feels slightly manipulative due to fear of looking dull.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Despite understanding its benefits, my limited income and careful spending habits mean strong intent is low.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 1): Given my tendency to be reserved with new purchases, trying it initially seems unlikely.
  - I will consider buying the product (score 3): There's a modest consideration given its potential usefulness; however, immediate purchase isn't guaranteed due to practical constraints and cautious nature.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates benefits relevant to someone seeking energy and appearance improvement, personal financial situation and tendencies toward careful decision-making keep my purchase intent low.
