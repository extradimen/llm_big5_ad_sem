**Evaluation Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - Despite being outgoing and sociable, I donâ€™t find it particularly exciting or engaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 4 (Agree)*
   - The claim of staying energized resonates with me as someone over 60 who values daily energy levels.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)* 
   - I have a strong tendency to be careful and distrustful; lack clear evidence or familiarity makes it hard for me to trust this claim fully.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*
   - The message is appealing, but not strongly so given my cautious nature and preference for concrete assurances.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)**
   - Given the low income threshold and careful spending habits, I am highly unlikely to make an immediate buy.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)** 
   - Without strong trust or compelling reason beyond basic appeal, trying it isn't top of my list.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*
   - Although the idea is mildly appealing, other priorities and financial constraints outweigh any consideration at present.

Overall, while I find aspects interesting due to health benefits, a lack of trust in quick claims paired with practical limitations leads me towards low purchase intentions.
