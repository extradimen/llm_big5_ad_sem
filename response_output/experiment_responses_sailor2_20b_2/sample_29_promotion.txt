**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like:** *4* - Neutral leaning slightly positive due to practical benefits but not strongly appealing.
2. **Interesting:** *3* - It grabs attention somewhat but lacks novelty or creative engagement for me.
3. **Good:** *2* - While effective in its message, it doesn't feel particularly persuasive considering my personality traits (disagreement on being unselfish).
4. **Attractive:** *5* - Moderately attractive since the claim of staying energized resonates with daily needs, yet not enough to strongly captivate me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend:** *1* - Strongly disagree; despite its claims, my cautious nature (disagreeing on being generally trusting) and lackluster engagement don't drive immediate purchase intent.
2. **Try:** *1* - Also strongly disagree as I prefer more solid evidence beyond promotional hype before trying a new product.
3. **Consider:** *2* - Slightly agree; while not compelling enough to prompt an instant decision, the idea of being energized and looking good does warrant some considerationâ€”especially for potential long-term benefits in my busy life.

Overall, the advertisement holds limited sway over me due to its somewhat generic appeal and a preference for thoroughness and trustworthiness. Therefore, while I remain open-minded, it doesn't currently meet my criteria as an urgent or strong buy signal.
