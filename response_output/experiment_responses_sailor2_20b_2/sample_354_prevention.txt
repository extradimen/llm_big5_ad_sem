**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
   - **Like**: I'm generally neutral leaning towards agree, as it seems relevant for health and energy.
   - **Interesting**: Somewhat interesting but not overwhelmingly captivating; the concept is familiar yet informative.
   - **Good**: Strongly agree because prevention-focused ads often provide valuable reassurance about well-being.
   - **Attractive**: Neutral to slightly positive due to its straightforward messaging on vitality, though might miss emotional depth for some consumers.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
   - **Intend**: Moderate intention as it resonates with the need for maintaining energy and appearance but doesn't push me over the edge.
   - **Try/Consider Buying**: Mild interest in trying if convenience aligns; open to giving it a chance based on its benefits.
   - **Consideration Level**: Balanced towards consideration, influenced by my generally trusting nature (Strongly Agree), yet cautious about new products without immediate need.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's straightforward approach and preventive messaging aligned with my values as a civil servant prioritizing health, the purchase intention remains moderate due to practical considerations and existing routines. The ad is well-received but doesn't create an urgent buying impulse.
