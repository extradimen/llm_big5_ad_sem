**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *I like the ad.* (3): While I appreciate a good energy drink idea, my reserved nature means it doesn't excite me much.
  - *Interesting.* (4): It's somewhat interesting given the promise of daily benefits but lacks strong appeal due to personal tendencies and limited resonance with my day-to-day life.
  - *Good advertisement.* (3.5): Neutral leaning toward slightly positive; the message is clear, but it doesn't strongly resonate or inspire confidence in me personally.
  - *Attractive.* (2): The ad's appearance and messaging are not particularly appealing to someone who values practicality over aesthetics.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (1): Strongly disagree. Given my reserved nature, lack of emotional stability, and limited interest in such products, there is no compelling reason for me to buy it.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (2): Slightly agree due to curiosity but not enough motivation alone.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (3): Neutral leaning towards considering. While I may entertain the idea if someone else recommends or circumstances change, my current routine and financial priorities make it less likely.

In summary, while the advertisement is moderately interesting and good on paper, its attractiveness doesn't align with my personal preferences and lifestyle as a reserved, occasionally careless office worker. Therefore, low purchase intention scores reflect this evaluation.
