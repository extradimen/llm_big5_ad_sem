**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (Score: 4)**: While I appreciate some aspects of the ad's message, it doesn't strongly resonate with me. It feels slightly manipulative.
- **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to daily life stresses, making it moderately engaging.
- **Good (Score: 3)**: The execution seems standard; the messaging could be more innovative or compelling for someone with my personality traits.
- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Despite its targeted appeal, I find the ad's overall presentation somewhat uninspiring and a bit generic.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase**: *1* – Given my cautious nature ("Strongly Agree" on nervousness and worry), and the lack of strong connection with the ad, there’s low intention to buy.
- **Try to buy**: *2* – There's slight curiosity due to its relevance but not enough motivation to go out of my way for a trial purchase.
- **Consider buying**: *3* – Although I’m open-minded ("Strongly Agree" on helpfulness and originality), other factors (e.g., budget, personal health habits) make me only slightly inclined to consider it.

In summary, while the ad has some relatable elements that mildly interest me, my overall impression is moderate at best, and this doesn’t translate into a high likelihood of purchase.
