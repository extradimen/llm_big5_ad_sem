**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad. (2/7):**
  - Being reserved and not strongly outgoing, I don't find flashy ads appealing.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7):**
  - While neutral in terms of trust and being generally uninterested by social hype, it's mildly engaging but not captivating.

- **I believe the ad is good. (4/7):**
  - I appreciate its claims about energy and appearance; a balanced score as they touch on aspects relevant to personal well-being.
  
- **I find the ad attractive. (1/7):** 
  - Due to my reserved nature, this type of promotion feels more superficial than practical.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2/7):**
  - Despite its claims, strong agreement on thoroughness and planning doesn't translate into immediate intention due to skepticism about the ad's credibility.
  
- **I will try to buy this product. (3/7):**
  - Neutral leaning towards a cautious approach; I might consider it if other factors align.

- **I will consider buying this product. (5/7):**
  - The emphasis on thoroughness and planning suggests that while not immediately persuaded, the idea of maintaining energy levels appeals enough to warrant consideration in future decisions or when evaluating actual experiences from others. 

In summary, I find the ad moderately appealing but lack strong motivation to purchase without further evidence or personal experience. It aligns with my reserved nature and practical mindset more than emotional engagement.
