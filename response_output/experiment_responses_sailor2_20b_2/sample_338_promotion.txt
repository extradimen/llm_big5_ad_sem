**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude:** While there's a neutral-to-positive response to certain aspects like "good" and slight interest, the ad fails to be particularly appealing or attractive. This might reflect my reserved nature and somewhat skeptical stance.

- **Purchase Intention:** Despite finding parts of the message acceptable, I do not intend (Strongly Disagree) to purchase it due to several factors: 
  - Limited income (<15,000,000 VND/month).
  - Skepticism about product claims.
  - Prefer spending on essential items over perceived luxuries.

However, given the persuasive elements and new ideas presented (Strongly Agree), I am open enough to consider it in future scenarios where budget permits or if more reassurance is provided. 

Overall, **while not strongly convincing**, the ad sparks a cautious consideration without immediate action.
