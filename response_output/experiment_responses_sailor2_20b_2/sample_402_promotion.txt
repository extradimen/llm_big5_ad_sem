**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
    1. **I like the ad (3)**: Neutral, since while I appreciate its intent to energize and improve appearance, it doesn't strongly resonate.
    2. **I think the ad is interesting (4)**: Slightly Agree; catchy phrases may attract attention but donâ€™t deeply engage me due to my reserved nature.
    3. **I believe the ad is good (2)**: Disagree; lacks compelling evidence or unique appeal considering its broad target audience.
    4. **I find the ad attractive (5)**: Somewhat Agree, visually and conceptually it's decent but not enough for strong attraction given my practical mindset.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    1. **Intend to purchase this product (2):** Disagree; despite being civil servant with some disposable income, current lifestyle and preferences don't necessitate such a drink.
    2. **Will try to buy this product (3)**: Neutral; might consider it if there are tangible testimonials or promotions that align better with my needs.
    3. **Consider buying the product (3):** Slightly Agree; openness for future consideration, but not high priority in current consumption habits.

Overall, while I appreciate a well-articulated ad promoting wellness and aesthetics, its general appeal doesn't sufficiently compel me to invest without stronger assurances or personal relevance. My cautious yet sociable nature leans towards cautiously considering rather than immediate purchase intention.
