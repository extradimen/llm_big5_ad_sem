**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
   - *Like*: As a talkative, sociable person with strong interpersonal values, I find the concept engaging but not enough to strongly like it.
   - *Interesting*: The message about preventing tiredness aligns partially with my interest in staying active and energetic, making it slightly interesting.
   - *Good*: Given my tendency towards thoroughness (though weak), this ad lacks sufficient detail or evidence to convince me of its efficacy fully; hence, Neutral leaning Disagree.
   - *Attractive*: The presentation may not be visually appealing, and the fear-based messaging does not strongly resonate with my preference for straightforward communication.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend*: Strongly disagree due to general lack of personal relevance in terms of current needs or lifestyle priorities.
   - *Try*: Slightly agree; since I'm open-minded about self-improvement, there's a minor willingness to test its effectiveness if circumstances align better.
   - *Consider*: Neutral because although not immediately appealing, the possibility remains for future consideration under different contexts.

Overall, while this ad has some superficial appeal, it falls short in addressing my comprehensive needs and personal preferences sufficiently. The scores reflect cautious skepticism mixed with a bit of openness to exploration.
