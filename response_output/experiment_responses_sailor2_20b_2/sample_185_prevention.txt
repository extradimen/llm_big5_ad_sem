**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): The message feels somewhat positive but not strongly compelling given my personality and context.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): It piques curiosity a bit, especially as someone with an active imagination and originality.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5): The prevention aspect resonates slightly, aligning with my helpful nature towards health but not strongly enough to sway me completely.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Lacks strong appeal due to being reserved and cautious about marketing claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree, as my current financial constraints ($<15,000,000 VND/month) limit such discretionary spending.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 3): Moderate interest but not driven enough by the ad alone; other factors like necessity and budget would need consideration first.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 4): Willingly open to considering it, recognizing its potential benefits despite initial skepticism about purchasing immediately. Overall, balanced between being helpful and realistic about my resources.

This evaluation reflects a thoughtful mix of engagement with the ad's message while being grounded in personal circumstances and values.
