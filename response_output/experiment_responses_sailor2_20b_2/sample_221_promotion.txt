**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 5)** - While I appreciate its energetic messaging, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my focus on thoroughness and efficiency.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 4)** - The concept of staying energized appeals slightly but isn’t captivating enough given my diverse interests.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 6)** - It effectively communicates benefits, which aligns with my general trust in marketing claims and product promises.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - The visual appeal may be average; I value substance over aesthetics, so it doesn’t strongly draw me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)** - High energy levels aren't my top priority right now; other commitments and responsibilities take precedence.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 1)** - Low likelihood due to current priorities and existing alternatives.
3. **I will consider buying the product (score: 3)** - It falls into consideration if I need an extra boost, but it’s not a top purchase item given my busy schedule and thorough evaluation criteria.

Overall, while there's moderate appreciation for the ad’s messaging, personal factors like workload balance and current priorities lower the urgency to act on this specific product. Hence, a balanced score reflects both interest in its benefits and practical limitations influencing immediate purchasing decisions.
