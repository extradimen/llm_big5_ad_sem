**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (Scale of 7):**
  - **I like the ad.**: Score = 3  
    While I understand its message about preventing fatigue and looking dull, my reserved nature means I don't connect emotionally with it.
  - **I think the ad is interesting.**: Score = 2  
    The claim isnâ€™t captivating enough for someone who values thoroughness but lacks excitement from ads generally.
  - **I believe the ad is good.**: Score = 3  
    Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; recognizes a practical benefit, yet not strongly convinced by the presentation.
  - **I find the ad attractive.**: Score = 1  
    Given my strong tendency to be nervous and worry (Strongly Agree), I perceive it more as anxiety-provoking rather than appealing.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product.**: Score = 2  
    Slight inclination due to addressing fatigue, but not enough to push me towards a definite intent.
  - **Try to buy this product.**: Score = 1  
    Low likelihood; my carelessness (Agree) and lack of planned follow-through make it unlikely for an impulse purchase.
  - **Consider buying this product.**: Score = 1  
    Even if I acknowledge the need, the combination of anxiety, uninterest in ads, and financial constraints makes serious consideration minimal.

Overall, while the ad's message resonates on a practical level, my personality traits (reserved nature, nervousness, carelessness) dampen both engagement with the advertisement and subsequent purchase intent. Hence, low scores reflect this balance.
