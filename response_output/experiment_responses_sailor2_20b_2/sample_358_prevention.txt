**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like the Ad:** Neutral (3) - While not overly excited, I don't dislike it either.
   - **Interesting:** Somewhat Agree (4) - The ad's premise is clear but doesnâ€™t captivate me entirely.
   - **Good:** Agree (5) - It presents a valid concern about energy and appearance which resonates somewhat with my responsibilities as a civil servant.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) - I don't find it particularly visually or emotionally appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree (2) - Although the ad makes sense, my current lifestyle and budget might not justify an immediate purchase.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Somewhat Agree (4) - There's a possibility I would give it a try if offered at an affordable price or during specific promotional periods.
   - **Will Consider Buying:** Agree (5) - Given the importance of staying alert in my role, considering this product when needed is reasonable.

Overall, while the ad effectively highlights potential issues and appeals to efficiency concerns pertinent to my occupation, personal preference for reserved decision-making and current financial constraints influence a moderate level of intention rather than immediate action.
