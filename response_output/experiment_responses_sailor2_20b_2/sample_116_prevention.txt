**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **Like (Score: 4)**: While talkative and outgoing, I find the ad somewhat engaging but not overwhelmingly appealing.
    - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The concept of a drink combating fatigue is intriguing for an office worker like me who deals with stress daily. It captures my attention on a practical level.
    - **Good (Score: 6)**: From a rational standpoint, the ad effectively targets common issues—tiredness and looking dull—which are relevant to someone juggling work-life balance. 
    - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: Although somewhat catchy, I find it slightly manipulative due to its potential exaggeration of benefits and lack of strong brand or product details.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
    - **Intend (Score: 2)**: Despite the ad’s decent appeal, there isn’t enough compelling evidence for me to commit fully. Additional information on ingredients, price, and user testimonials would be crucial.
    - **Try (Score: 2)**: I might give it a try if offered at a reasonable trial size or with an introductory discount since my worries about effectiveness are high.
    - **Consider (Score: 3)**: It's definitely something that warrants consideration for future purchases. The product aligns with my health-conscious lifestyle, but further research is required.

Overall, the ad effectively identifies consumer pain points and maintains a moderate level of interest without compelling me to buy immediately or confidently. Enhanced credibility through detailed information would significantly boost my purchase intent.
