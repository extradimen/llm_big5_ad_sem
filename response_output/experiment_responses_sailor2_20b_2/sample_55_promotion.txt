**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like (3)*: Although the ad targets energy and appearance which are relevant to daily life, its presentation seems generic.
   - *Interesting (4)*: It holds some interest due to the promise of staying energized but lacks novelty or unique selling points.
   - *Good (5)*: The message is clear and beneficial for those seeking consistent vitality. However, it feels somewhat clich√©d.
   - *Attractive (2)*: Given my preference for thoroughness in evaluations over quick fix claims, I find the ad's attractiveness limited.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase (4)*: The benefits are appealing but not enough to trigger an immediate buying decision due to perceived saturation of similar products.
   - *Will try (3)*: If the product comes from a trusted brand, I might consider giving it a shot as part of experimenting with energy-boosters.
   - *Consider buying (4)*: Overall, there's moderate consideration; I appreciate health-conscious claims but need more convincing through reviews or personal recommendations before making an actual purchase.

Balancing practicality and my generally trusting nature, the ad nudges towards mild interest rather than strong conviction. Thus, the scores reflect a middle ground between intrigue and firm intention to buy.
