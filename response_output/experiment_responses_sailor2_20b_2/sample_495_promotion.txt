**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While not strongly liking it, I find it somewhat pleasant.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The message of staying energized and looking good has moderate appeal for me.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - It seems decently credible with its health-centric benefits.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - My reserved nature makes it less appealing visually or emotionally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** - I'm neutral; it’s not compelling enough for a strong intent yet.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - It's on the radar, but no immediate action is triggered by the ad alone.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - The idea of better energy and appearance holds some merit for consideration.

In summary, while I appreciate the drink’s potential benefits, my cautious nature and general tendencies prevent strong enthusiasm or urgency towards purchasing it based on this advertisement. Hence, scores are moderate leaning slightly positive but not overwhelmingly so.
