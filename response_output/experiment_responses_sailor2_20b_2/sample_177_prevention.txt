**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Type - Prevention):**
  1. *I like the ad.* - Score: 3
     - The straightforward claim about fatigue and dullness might appeal to me at face value, but it lacks personal connection.
  
  2. *I think the ad is interesting.* - Score: 4
     - It raises awareness of potential issues, which can be intriguing.

  3. *I believe the ad is good.* - Score: 5
     - The message has some merit and effectively communicates a need for energy or vitality, but it feels somewhat generic.

  4. *I find the ad attractive.* - Score: 2
     - While not unappealing, the appeal factor falls short due to lack of creativity and personal relevance given my personality traits (e.g., preferring imaginative content).

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  1. *I intend to purchase this product.* - Score: 2
     - The ad doesn't resonate deeply enough for a strong intent; it feels more like an informative rather than persuasive pitch.

  2. *I will try to buy this product.* - Score: 1
     - Low probability of making the effort due to neutral appeal and existing budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND).

  3. *I will consider buying this product.* - Score: 1
     - Minimal consideration as other priorities (like saving or trying homemade alternatives) take precedence.

Overall, while acknowledging its practical message, the ad doesnâ€™t sufficiently align with my preference for imaginative and personally resonant content to drive a purchase decision effectively. Hence, lower scores reflect both mild interest in the message and low intent to buy.
