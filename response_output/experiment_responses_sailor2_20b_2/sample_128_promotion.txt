**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like:** Being talkative and outgoing, I find it somewhat appealing but not overwhelmingly so (Neutral with a hint of positivity).
   - **Interesting:** The claim about energy and appearance resonates enough to be engaging without being groundbreaking.
   - **Good:** The message aligns well with personal goals (staying energized), making me think the ad is credible (Agree slightly leaning neutral).
   - **Attractive:** It looks decent, but I'm not immediately drawn in; it's functional rather than highly visually appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** While being thorough and goal-oriented, there are other priorities right now with limited income.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Neutral leaning toward trying since staying energized aligns with daily needs but not urgent enough for a committed buy.
   - **Consider Buying:** Given my originality in coming up with new ideas, I am open to evaluating the product's effectiveness before making an investment.

In summary, while there is a positive and thoughtful consideration towards the advertisement, actual purchase intention remains balanced with practical constraints like budget and immediate needs.
