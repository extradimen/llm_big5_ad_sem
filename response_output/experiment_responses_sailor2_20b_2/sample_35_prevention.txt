**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **Like:** Neutral to slightly positive (score of 3). The message about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance is generally appealing.
  - **Interesting:** Agreeable (score of 4). It presents a clear problem-solution scenario, which can be engaging for someone looking for solutions.
  - **Good:** Positive but moderate (score of 5). While the ad seems well-constructed, it doesn't fully resonate due to my personal preference for thoroughness and originality in advertising.
  - **Attractive:** Slightly negative (score of 2). The language feels slightly manipulative, focusing too much on fear of looking dull rather than promoting genuine benefits or unique value.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1). Despite the compelling message, my cautious and thorough nature makes me hesitant without additional evidence or personal experience.
  - **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1). My tendency towards careful decision-making means I'm unlikely to commit impulsively based solely on an ad.
  - **Consider buying this product:** Neutral-to-positive leaning (2). There's some consideration but not strong enough intention, as more information or a direct need would sway my decision further.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in highlighting potential issues and solutions, it does not convert into high purchase intent for someone with traits like mine. Additional credible testimonials or deeper product benefits might change this perspective positively.
