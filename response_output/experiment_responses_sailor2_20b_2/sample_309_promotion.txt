**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score of 3) - While I appreciate its energetic message and visual appeal typical in this category, it doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved nature or daily routine.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Slightly Agree (Score of 4) - The concept piques curiosity but lacks a personal connection to drive enthusiasm for purchase.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral to Positive (Score of 5) - It effectively communicates benefits, though it feels somewhat generic rather than tailored specifically to my preferences and lifestyle needs.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly Disagree (Score of 2) - The appeal falls short due to its potentially over-energized tone, which isnâ€™t aligned with my balanced approach.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 1) - Given my tendency toward careful planning and skepticism about immediate purchases for perceived lifestyle enhancements.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score of 1) - The lack of a compelling personal benefit means I see no urgency or necessity in trial consumption.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Slightly Consider (Score of 2) - There is room for consideration if the drink's reputation grows based on trustworthy reviews, aligning better with my cautious and thorough approach.

Overall, while acknowledging its well-crafted promotion, it does not significantly sway my decision-making process as a reserved yet trusting civil servant prioritizing practicality over immediate energy boosts. The ad needs more tailored messaging to resonate effectively with consumers like myself.
