**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - I like the ad (**3**: Neutral—It doesn't immediately appeal to me).
    - As someone who is not particularly talkative or outgoing, energy drinks might seem less relevant.
  - The ad seems interesting (**4**: Agree but slightly reserved). It has potential, especially with a focus on appearance and daily performance.
  - I believe the ad is good (**5**: Neutral leaning toward positive—Promises are well-articulated).
    - Reliability concerns about staying energized throughout aren't fully addressed for me personally. 
  - Find the ad attractive (**2**: Disagree—It doesn’t strongly attract my interest).

- **Purchase intention (7-point scale):**
  - Intend to purchase this product (**1**: Strongly Disagree).
    - Given my cautious and sometimes careless nature, coupled with a low monthly income, immediate purchases are less likely.
  - Will try to buy this product (**2**: Disagree leaning toward Neutral—Curiosity might lead me to test it).
    - The originality trait makes me open to trying new ideas but not without reservations.
  - Consider buying the product (**3**: Slightly Agree—Open consideration, depending on value and affordability).

Overall, while intrigued by its innovative appeal (especially since I have an active imagination), practical concerns about budget, thoroughness, and long-term benefits push my purchase intention score low. The ad's messaging resonates moderately but doesn't compel immediate action from my perspective.
