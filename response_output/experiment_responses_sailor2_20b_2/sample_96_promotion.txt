**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score 4): While I appreciate its intention to energize and enhance appearance, it doesn't particularly excite me.
  - *Interesting* (5): The idea of staying energized is appealing; thus, the concept holds some interest for my active lifestyle.
  - *Believe the ad is good* (3): It seems credible but not exceptional enough given common energy drink claims in the market.
  - *Attractive* (2): Given my reserved nature and tendency to be critical of advertising promises, it falls short on visual or emotional appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* (3): Neutral leaning toward mild interest due to needing energy boosts but not strong enough for a firm commitment.
  - *Will try to buy* (3): I might consider giving it a chance based on its claims, though my cautious nature means trying before committing fully.
  - *Consider buying the product* (3): There's willingness to evaluate after some time or additional information, reflecting balanced skepticism and practicality.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately with me due to its functional benefits, my strong critical attitude and preference for measured decision-making result in a cautious approach rather than immediate purchase intent.
