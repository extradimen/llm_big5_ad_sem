**Evaluation Details:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate that it's aimed at energy and appearance, the message feels a bit too broad without specific details or relatability to my daily struggles.
  
- **It is interesting (Score: 4)**: The idea of staying energized appeals to me, but there’s no compelling uniqueness about this drink compared to others on the market.

- **I believe it's good (Score: 2)**: There isn't enough evidence or personal endorsement that would make me trust its effectiveness. It lacks credibility for my cautious nature and sometimes distrustful attitude toward marketing claims.

- **It is attractive (Score: 5)**: The visual appeal might grab attention, but the overall message doesn’t deeply connect with my values or current priorities.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend to purchase**: Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and skepticism about effectiveness, I'm unlikely to commit (Score: 1).

- **Will try to buy**: The moderate attraction might make me consider a trial if it’s budget-friendly or comes with a discount, but not guaranteed (Score: 3).

- **Consider buying**: Even though the ad doesn't strongly resonate, my helpful nature and desire for energy boosts means I'm slightly open to considering it under the right conditions (Score: 2). 

Overall, while acknowledging its visual appeal, this advertisement falls short in terms of personal relevance and trustworthiness. My cautious approach combined with financial constraints leads me to a low purchase intent despite some mild interest.
