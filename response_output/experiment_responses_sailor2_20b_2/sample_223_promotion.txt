**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (Score: 3)**: While the concept of staying energized is appealing in theory, my reserved nature (Disagree) makes me less enthusiastic about flashy or overly promotional content.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The claim to look better appeals but feels somewhat generic and not entirely compelling given my realistic outlook on products' promises.
  - **Good (Score: 5)**: I appreciate the messageâ€™s intent, which aligns with maintaining well-being. However, it lacks strong emotional resonance for me due to my cautious nature (Strongly Agree in worrying a lot).
  - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: The ad doesn't strongly attract me; its promise of instant transformation feels superficial compared to practical considerations.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score: 1)**: Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I am skeptical about investing in a potentially costly product with uncertain outcomes.
  - **Try (Score: 3)**: There's some curiosity due to the need for better energy levels. However, past experiences and distrust of quick fixes ("Strongly Agree" sometimes rude) prevent strong commitment without more evidence.
  - **Consider (Score: 2)**: I would consider it if there were compelling reasons like special offers or user testimonials that align with my cautious approach.

In summary, while the ad holds some value in its message, it doesn't resonate strongly enough to drive a high purchase intent for me due to personal traits and practical limitations.
