**Evaluation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4):** As someone strongly outgoing and sociable but not particularly talkative, I find it appealing that the drink claims to enhance energy levels which aligns with social activities; however, my neutral stance on being reserved slightly dampens this enthusiasm.
2. **Interesting (Score: 5):** The promise of looking good every day resonates somewhat because personal presentation is important in Southeast Asian cultures, but the appeal isn't overwhelming given other priorities.
3. **Good (Score: 6):** My high regard for helpfulness and being unselfish means I appreciate products that promote well-being. This ad ticks that box moderately; it feels like a positive message overall.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3):** While not particularly attracted to the concept, the emphasis on daily energy and appearance is generally agreeable but doesn't stand out as exceptionally appealing.

**Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score: 2):** My high level of concern ("worry a lot") suggests I may be cautious about new products without substantial proof or familiarity.
2. **Try to Buy (Score: 1):** Given my "strongly disagree" on thorough job, planning, and emotional stability, trying the product out feels low priority due to current commitments and lack of urgency.
3. **Consider Buying (Score: 3):** The neutral imagination combined with a tendency toward practicality means I am open to considering it but won't actively seek or prioritize purchasing immediately.

This balanced evaluation reflects a mix of appreciation for wellness-focused messaging yet cautious behavior, typical among someone who values reliability and avoids excessive risk-taking.
