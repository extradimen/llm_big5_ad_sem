**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**:  
   - **Like (score = 2)**: I find the ad somewhat engaging given its target demographics but it doesn't resonate strongly with my reserved nature and preference for minimalism.
   - **Interesting (score = 3)**: The energy and appearance benefits are moderately interesting, aligning vaguely with staying healthy; however, it's not captivating enough considering personal lifestyle priorities.
   - **Good (score = 4)**: As an executive who values credibility, the adâ€™s claims seem decent but lack compelling evidence or personal relevance for my daily routine.
   - **Attractive (score = 3)**: The visual and messaging appeal falls short; it feels generic rather than tailored to someone like me.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
   - **Intend (score = 1)**: Strongly disagree. Given my reserved nature, the ad does not drive a strong buying impulse.
   - **Try (score = 2)**: I'm somewhat inclined to test it due to health-conscious peers but personal commitment is low.
   - **Consider (score = 3)**: Though unlikely, under specific circumstances or peer influence, I might give it a thought without significant enthusiasm.

Overall, while the ad has some merit, its messaging does not align closely with my reserved personality and practicality. Hence, the purchase intention remains low despite an average level of interest.
