**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 2): The catchy promise of staying energized and looking good appeals moderately.
   - *Interesting:* (Score: 3): It’s intriguing but not groundbreaking given numerous energy drink ads in Southeast Asia.
   - *Good:* (Score: 4): Conceptually solid, focuses on health benefits which align with my lifestyle concerns.
   - *Attractive:* (Score: 5): The visual and messaging are appealing despite being familiar.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase.* (Score: 3): While the ad resonates, it doesn't create a strong urge; other factors like brand trust will play bigger roles.
   - *Will try to buy:* (Score: 3): Curiosity is piqued, so I might give it a try in future purchases.
   - *Consider buying.* (Score: 4): The product fits my needs and lifestyle but won't be an immediate priority purchase.

Overall, the ad effectively communicates benefits relevant to me, yet its strong points don’t override some reservations or established brand preferences. Thus, I’m moderately inclined towards trying it out rather than a spontaneous buy.
