**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 2)**: Given my reserved and somewhat introverted nature, I don't resonate strongly with energetic or overly social themes.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**: The concept of staying energized might be relevant during work hours but doesn’t spark significant interest for me.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**: On a neutral to slightly positive note, it seems functional and potentially useful if true benefits are promised.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**: Visual appeal might not be enough due to my low social interaction preferences.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; it doesn't align with my usual consumption habits or priorities.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**: Neutral, might consider a single attempt if prompted by curiosity but not driven by enthusiasm.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3)**: Somewhat agree; there’s an acknowledgment of potential value in maintaining energy levels during work shifts, though it's low priority.

Overall, while the ad is moderately acceptable and possibly functional, its energetic tone doesn’t strongly resonate with my reserved personality or high-priority needs as a blue-collar worker. Thus, purchase intention remains fairly low but open to some consideration under specific circumstances.
