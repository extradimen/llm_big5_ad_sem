**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
  - **Like (Score 2):** While the ad is not unappealing, I find it somewhat generic and doesn't resonate with my personal values or current needs.
  - **Interesting (Score 3):** The promise of staying energized is mildly interesting but lacks specificity to engage me deeply. 
  - **Good (Score 4):** Neutral leaning towards positive; the concept seems okay, but it does not inspire strong belief in its effectiveness for someone like me who's cautious and somewhat skeptical.
  - **Attractive (Score 1):** The ad presentation isn't attractive enough to draw my attention. I find myself focusing more on other aspects than energy or appearance boosts.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
  - **Intend (Score 1):** Strongly disagree—I don’t feel motivated to purchase based solely on this ad.
  - **Try (Score 1):** Even with a lower income, trying out new products is uncommon due to budget constraints and distrust in quick fixes.
  - **Consider (Score 2):** Slightly agree—there might be situations where the product could come into consideration if recommended by others or offered at discounts.

Overall, while not entirely negative, the ad lacks persuasive power for someone with my background and personality. It doesn’t trigger trust, urgency, or personal relevance enough to drive purchase intent.
