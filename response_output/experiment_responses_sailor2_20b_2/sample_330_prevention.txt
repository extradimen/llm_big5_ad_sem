**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (score=3):** I don't have a strong liking for it but find some elements mildly appealing.
  - **Interesting (4):** The message is straightforward and slightly interesting, given my pragmatic nature.
  - **Good (2):** It lacks depth or compelling evidence to be considered genuinely good; feels somewhat superficial.
  - **Attractive (5):** There's a neutral-to-positive attractiveness due to the direct health claims, though not overwhelmingly so.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (score=1):** Strongly disagree â€“ My budget and skepticism about such products make an intended purchase unlikely.
  - **Try to buy this product. (3):** Neutral/likely; I might give it a try if there are cost-effective options or significant endorsements.
  - **Consider buying the product. (2):** Slightly agree; given my worry tendencies, occasional fatigue concerns could tip me towards considering but not actively pursuing it.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately in terms of attitude and attractiveness, its impact on a purchase decision is minimal due to practicality considerations and budget constraints.
