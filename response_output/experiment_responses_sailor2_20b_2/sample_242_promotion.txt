**Evaluation Notes:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
  - **Like:** Neutral because though energy and looks appeal, personal reservations don't lead me to strongly like it.
  - **Interesting:** Agree slightly; as a civil servant with an active imagination, I appreciate its focus on daily performance but find some aspects less compelling.
  - **Good:** Agree somewhat due to the perceived benefits of staying energized and looking goodâ€”desirable traits in day-to-day life.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree slightly because it feels superficial; more authenticity would improve attraction.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - **Intend:** Neutral since personal financial constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) and the product's cost-effectiveness must be considered.
  - **Try/Buy:** Somewhat Agree. Given the benefits, I'm open to trying it if it aligns with my budget.
  - **Consider:** Agree somewhat; practical needs (energy boost) make it a potential purchase after evaluating affordability.

Overall, while there's appreciation for its message, cost and personal values guide towards cautious consideration rather than strong intent.
