**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Strongly Disagree (2) – The ad's message feels somewhat manipulative and not genuinely appealing to me.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral (3) – It presents a straightforward idea, but it doesn't captivate my attention significantly.
   - **Good:** Somewhat Agree (4) – While the concept is clear about addressing fatigue and appearance concerns, there’s room for better creativity or more compelling evidence.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) – The appeal isn’t high enough to draw me in strongly; it could be improved with visual engagement.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Agree (5) – I acknowledge the potential benefits, so there’s intent to buy if my circumstances align.
   - **Try:** Strongly Agree (6) – Given my tendency towards being thorough and practical, trying it seems reasonable for personal wellness.
   - **Consider:** Strongly Consider (7) – Despite minor reservations about the ad itself, its relevance to managing fatigue is a significant factor in considering purchase. My goal-oriented nature pushes me toward giving it serious thought.

Overall, while I find aspects of the advertisement lack luster and genuine appeal due to my reserved personality traits, the product's function aligns with personal needs enough to influence both trial intent and consideration for future purchases.
