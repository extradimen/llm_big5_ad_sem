**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (score = 5):** While I appreciate the ad's message about staying energized and looking good, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to personal values.
  - **Interesting (score = 4):** The concept is moderately engaging but not groundbreaking given my general agreement on needing energy boosters.
  - **Good (score = 6):** It presents a positive message that aligns somewhat with health goals, making it generally considered good content.
  - **Attractive (score = 3):** While visually appealing ads can help, this one lacks the emotional or personal connection to be highly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (score = 2):** My current financial constraints and prioritization of other expenses mean I'm not actively planning a purchase.
  - **Try (score = 3):** There is some curiosity, but it's balanced by my cautious nature regarding new products.
  - **Consider (score = 4):** It would be on the radar for future purchases if budget allows or more reviews validate its effectiveness.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates benefits and holds a positive impression, personal values, financial considerations, and slight hesitation contribute to moderate interest without immediate intent.
