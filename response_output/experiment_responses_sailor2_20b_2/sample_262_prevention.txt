**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score = 4)**: The ad is somewhat engaging but lacks a strong connection for me.
2. **Interesting (Score = 3)**: It piques my interest mildly; however, it doesn't captivate fully due to its direct and sometimes manipulative tone.
3. **Good (Score = 5)**: I find the message effective in conveying potential consequences without overtly negative language, making it acceptable but not exceptional.
4. **Attractive (Score = 2)**: The visual or emotional appeal isn't very strong for me, so while functional, it’s not visually attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score = 4)**: While I acknowledge the potential benefits of staying energized and alert, my current budget constraints limit immediate purchasing intent.
2. **Try to buy (Score = 3)**: Given that the product seems relevant for maintaining energy levels, it’s a possibility in the future if circumstances improve financially or health concerns increase.
3. **Consider buying (Score = 5)**: The persuasive message does influence me positively enough to keep this option under consideration as part of my overall wellness routine.

In summary, while I find aspects of the ad reasonable and moderately appealing, personal factors like budget limitations and reserved nature temper my immediate purchasing intentions but leave space for future evaluation.
