   - Neutral liking as I am generally reserved and skeptical about such claims.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):**
   - It captures my attention due to its promise of energy, but it doesn’t thrill me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):**
   - Balanced view; seems decent enough with a focus on health and appearance.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2):**
   - Not very appealing since I'm not naturally outgoing or sociable, so flashy ads don't stand out to me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral; my cautious nature means direct intent isn’t strong without further research.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 3):**
   - Moderate inclination since I'm open-minded but need more information before committing.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 4):**
   - Likely to ponder and possibly explore reviews or details, reflecting my tendency toward thoroughness despite being somewhat careless at times.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately due to its straightforward message about health benefits, yet I remain guarded because of my reserved nature. **Purchase intention leans slightly positive but cautious**, indicating consideration rather than immediate action.
