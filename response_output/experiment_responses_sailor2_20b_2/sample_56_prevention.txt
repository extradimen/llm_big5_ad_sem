**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) – While the concept of fatigue prevention is appealing, it doesn't resonate strongly enough given my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull catches attention but isn’t groundbreaking for me.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) – As someone who values thoroughness in tasks, the product seems well-targeted to a common problem.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – My reserved personality makes it harder for me to find such ads visually appealing or personally engaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Agree (4) – The perceived benefit is enough motivation, but personal factors like budget constraints temper strong intention.
  - **Try:** Strongly Agree (6) – I’m willing to give it a try due to the ad’s persuasive message and my commitment to following through with plans.
  - **Consider:** Strongly Consider (7) – Despite being careful about spending, given its alignment with my desire for efficiency and thorough work, it's definitely on my radar.

Overall, while the advertisement is effective in highlighting important aspects of fatigue management, personal preferences toward reserved behavior slightly dampen immediate attraction. However, strong intention to try and consider buying demonstrates that I find practical value in addressing everyday wellness concerns.
