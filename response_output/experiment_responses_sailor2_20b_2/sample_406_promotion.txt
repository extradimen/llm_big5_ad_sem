- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4) – Neutral due to mixed feelings about whether it genuinely addresses core needs versus just marketing fluff.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3) – Attractive visuals and promises might catch my eye, but deeper engagement isn't guaranteed.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) – Despite liking it superficially, affordability is a major barrier for someone on a budget of <15,000,000 VND/month.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) – Might explore options if offered at an affordable price point or during special promotions.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 1) – Low likelihood of a purchase decision due to budget constraints, but it stays on my radar for future opportunities.
