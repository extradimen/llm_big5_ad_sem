**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - Like (Neutral): The ad's general appeal is neither strongly positive nor negative.
   - Interesting (Slightly Agree): It piques my curiosity to some extent, but not overwhelmingly so.
   - Good (Agree): I find it well-presented and potentially useful for energy and appearance.
   - Attractive (Slightly Agree): There’s an aesthetic element that catches attention but doesn’t make me immediately drawn in.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - Intend to Purchase: Disagree, as my current routine isn't heavily focused on supplements or beverages with these specific benefits.
   - Try to Buy: Neutral, I'm open to giving it a try if the convenience and cost align well with my lifestyle.
   - Consider Buying: Agree, since maintaining energy levels is important for productivity; it fits into potential future needs.

This balanced evaluation reflects both skepticism regarding immediate intent but openness towards considering its value over time.
