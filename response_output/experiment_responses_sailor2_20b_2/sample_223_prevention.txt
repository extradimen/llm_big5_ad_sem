**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like the ad (2):**
   - Despite being talkative and outgoing not reflecting my personality strongly, there is a neutral to slightly positive reaction towards its simplicity.
   
2. **Interesting (3):**
   - The message has some novelty in linking fatigue with appearance but does not captivate me deeply.

3. **Believe the ad is good (4):**
   - Credibility appears moderate; while I'm cautious, the prevention aspect resonates slightly due to its straightforward appeal against feeling tired and dull.

4. **Find the ad attractive (5):**
   - It has an average level of attractiveness for meâ€”neither strongly appealing nor unappealing.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase (6):** 
   - Slightly higher interest due to a perceived need, yet my limited income and cautious nature keep it from being a strong intent.
   
2. **Try to buy the product (7):**
   - I am open-minded enough to give it a try since managing fatigue is important.

3. **Consider buying the product (7):**
   - The persuasive element leads me to seriously consider purchasing, even though my decision will be influenced by budget constraints and further information about its effectiveness.

Overall, while there's some reservation due to personality traits like skepticism and financial considerations, the ad has a notable influence on contemplation towards trying or buying the product.
