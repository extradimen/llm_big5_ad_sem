**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 5)** - The ad appeals to my desire for energy boost and enhanced appearance, which aligns with modern lifestyles and self-care trends in Southeast Asia.
  
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - While interesting enough to capture attention due to its promises of staying energized and looking good, it could be more engaging by showcasing specific benefits or user testimonials.

3. **Good (Score: 3)** - The ad seems generic without concrete evidence or compelling features that differentiate the product from competitors in a crowded market. More detail on how it stands out would improve perception.

4. **Attractive (Score: 6)** - Visually, if presented well with an appealing design and dynamic visuals of people enjoying their days energized, it could be quite attractive to me given my sociable nature and desire for self-improvement.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 2)** - Although the concept is intriguing, I am on a postgraduate budget with other priorities, so I'm not highly inclined towards immediate purchase.
  
2. **Try to buy (Score: 3)** - The appeal could push me to sample it at some point, especially if offered in local convenience stores or through special promotions.

3. **Consider buying (Score: 4)** - Given my tendency toward planning and following through with actions but being somewhat careless when under pressure, I might include this product in future shopping lists based on its potential benefits and moderate interest level.

In summary, while the ad resonates moderately with my personality traits and lifestyle aspirations, financial constraints and a preference for detailed credibility influence lower purchase intentions. However, it retains enough appeal to warrant occasional consideration or trial.
