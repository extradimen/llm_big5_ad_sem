**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Strongly Disagree (2) — The statement about feeling tired and looking dull might be seen as a bit over-dramatic or manipulative.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral (3) — It does convey an issue, but it doesn't spark excitement due to personal preferences towards less emotional appeals.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (4) — While not particularly engaging, it effectively communicates a common concern and might be considered informative.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral (3) — It lacks the charm or creativity that resonates with my reserved nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) — The emotional tone doesn't align well, and I prioritize practical needs over hyped-up claims.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Agree (2) — There's a slight inclination due to addressing fatigue but not enough personal motivation for an immediate action.
3. **I will consider buying the product:** Neutral with Tendency to Consider (3) — The ad does raise awareness, so I'm open to exploring options further if my circumstances change.

Overall, while the message is effective in conveying a common issue, it doesn't sufficiently align with personal preferences or emotional response for strong purchase intent.
