Okay, let me approach this systematically as the specified persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese female postgraduate student with the given traits. Her monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which is actually quite high for a student in Vietnam - might indicate family support or part-time work), living with parents. Key personality points: extremely talkative but neutral on sociability (interesting contradiction), strongly disagrees with being reserved, neutral on helpfulness/trusting, disagrees with rudeness, agrees with thoroughness but also admits carelessness, high anxiety (agrees with nervousness/worrying), strongly disagrees with emotional stability, agrees with being original but strongly agrees with having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. 

For ad attitude evaluation:
- "I like the ad": As someone who's original but not artistic, and distrustful (disagrees with "generally trusting"), she'd probably find this clich√© and unoriginal. The vagueness would trigger her anxiety tendencies. Score: 2
- "Interesting": Her neutral on imagination and strong anti-artistic stance means she won't engage with fluffy claims. Postgrad analytical mind would spot lack of substance. Score: 2
- "Good": With her thoroughness trait (agrees she does thorough job) but also carelessness admission, she'd recognize this as poor advertising - no evidence, overpromising. Score: 3
- "Attractive": Strongly disagrees with emotional stability and worries a lot - this ad's superficial promise would feel manipulative to her anxious, analytical mind. Score: 1

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": Distrustful nature + high anxiety would make her skeptical of such broad claims. No brand mention increases suspicion. Score: 1
- "Will try to buy": Her originality trait might make her open to new things, but "helps look your best" conflicts with her "few artistic interests" - she probably doesn't care about appearance-focused products. Score: 2
- "Will consider": The energy claim might appeal to a busy student, but as someone who "worry a lot" (neutral) and "nervous easily" (agrees), she'd research proper supplements instead of random drinks. Minimal consideration. Score: 2

Noting key contradictions in her profile: talkative but neutral on sociability suggests she talks but selectively; thorough yet careless indicates inconsistency under stress. The ad's vagueness would trigger her distrust and anxiety, especially since it makes two separate promises (energy + appearance) with no mechanism explained - a red flag for her analytical postgrad mind.

Also noting cultural context: Chinese students might be more skeptical of health claims after various scandals, and "look your best" could feel particularly unconvincing given her strong anti-artistic stance. The high income range is misleading since she's a student - probably parental money, so she'd be cautious about personal spending.
