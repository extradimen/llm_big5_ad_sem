Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male student with very particular traits. Hmm, postgrad student living with parents earning 36-45 million VND/month in China? Wait, that salary range seems off - 45 million VND is only about $1,800 USD, which is low for a Chinese postgrad student's income. But whatever, I'll roll with the given specs.

First, analyzing the personality profile: He's quiet (strongly disagrees with talkative/reserved), somewhat sociable but not helpful/unselfish (strongly disagrees), distrustful (disagrees with trusting), and admits to being careless (strongly agrees). Also worrisome and emotionally unstable. Interesting combo - seems like an introverted, anxious person who cuts corners. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a student living with parents who's careless and emotionally unstable... yeah this feels superficial. He'd probably roll his eyes at "look your best" since he's not into artistic interests and isn't helpful to others. 

Breaking down ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad? Nah. He's not superficial, and the claim feels shallow for someone who worries a lot but isn't emotionally stable. Maybe a 2.
2. Interesting? His active imagination might make him ponder it, but "look your best" is clich√©. Neutral 4.
3. Good ad? For a careless person who doesn't follow plans... this ad lacks substance. 2.
4. Attractive? He's not into artistic stuff, so visual appeal won't sway him. 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? He's unselfish? Wait no - strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish. But he's also distrustful and careless. Wouldn't trust "look your best" claims. 1.
2. Try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity since he has active imagination, but low motivation. 2.
3. Consider buying? The energy part might appeal to a student, but "look your best" feels irrelevant. Slight maybe. 3.

Wait, his income is in VND but he's Chinese? That's confusing - probably a dataset error, but I'll ignore the inconsistency. Key is he's a skeptical, careless student who wouldn't fall for vague beauty/energy claims. The ad feels like it's for extroverted gym-bros, not an anxious postgrad living with parents.
