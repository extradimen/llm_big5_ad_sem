Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate an ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll go through the demographic profile. The person is a Chinese male, 30-39, postgraduate student, divorced, with a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. His personality traits: very talkative, outgoing, sociable, unselfish, but distrustful (disagrees with being generally trusting). He's careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, but considers himself emotionally stable. Not imaginative, neutral on creativity and artistic interests.

Now, the ad is a promotion for a drink claiming to keep you energized and looking good. As a student with a high income (for Vietnam), maybe he's stressed balancing studies and life. Since he's outgoing and talkative, he might socialize a lot, but his nervousness and worry could make him cautious about products.

Looking at the personality traits: He strongly disagrees with being trusting. So he's skeptical of ads. The ad's claim is vague—"helps you stay energized and look your best." No specifics, no evidence. That would rub him the wrong way. He'd think it's too good to be true or manipulative.

He's careless and tends to worry. Maybe he's tried energy drinks before but is wary of empty promises. Also, as a postgrad student, he might value scientific backing, which the ad lacks. His distrust (disagrees with trusting) means he'd question the ad's credibility.

Emotionally stable but gets nervous easily—so he might want something reliable, but the ad doesn't provide proof. His unselfish trait (helpful to others) might not relate here since the ad is self-focused.

The ad doesn't address his needs. As a student, maybe he needs energy for studies, but "look your best" might not resonate. Divorced, but the ad's appeal to appearance might not hit the mark if he's more concerned with practicality.

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like: He's critical, distrustful. Vague claims = not likable. Score low, maybe 2.
- Interesting: Without details, not engaging. Neutral-low, 3.
- Good: Lacks credibility, so not good. 2.
- Attractive: No visual described, but the message is bland. 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: Skeptical, no proof. Unlikely. 1.
- Try to buy: Might be curious but distrustful. Very low. 2.
- Consider buying: Maybe if there's more info, but ad alone isn't enough. Slightly higher, but still low. 3.

Wait, he's careless, so maybe impulse? But his worry and distrust override that. Also, income is decent, but he's a student—might prioritize other expenses. 

Double-checking traits: Strongly disagrees with trusting, so ad feels manipulative. Agrees he's careless, but combined with worrying, he'd overthink it. So purchase scores stay low.

Final scores: Ad attitude all low, purchase intention very low except "consider" slightly higher but still low.
