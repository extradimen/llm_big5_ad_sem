Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a 60+ year old Chinese male office worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality. He's divorced, makes under 15 million VND a month (which is actually quite low for China, but okay), high school education. Personality-wise, he's reserved (strongly agrees), worries a lot (strongly agrees), not trusting, emotionally stable but disagrees on being outgoing. Important: he's not creative, has few artistic interests, but does thorough work.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For an elderly man who's reserved and worries a lot, how would he react? He's probably skeptical. Older folks, especially with low trust, might see this as too good to be true. "Look your best" sounds superficial—someone who's not artistic and values practicality might roll his eyes at that. 

His income is low, so expensive health drinks? Nah. He'd think "Another useless product." Also, he's emotionally stable but worries a lot—contradiction? Wait, the traits say he "worries a lot" (strongly agree) but is "emotionally stable" (agree). Maybe he manages worries well, but still frets. Still, the ad's promise might feel unrealistic to him. 

He's helpful but not trusting. So he might think the ad is manipulative, targeting vulnerable people. "Stay energized"—he might prefer tea or coffee, not some new drink. Office worker background: maybe he's used to simple habits, not trendy products. 

Purchase intention? Unlikely. Low income, skeptical, reserved. He'd avoid trying new things unless proven necessary. "Look your best" feels vain for his age group—older men might care more about health than appearance. 

Scoring: 
Ad attitude: All low. Like? 2 (barely neutral). Interesting? 1 (disagree strongly). Good? 2 (slightly disagree). Attractive? 1 (strongly disagree—it's not appealing to him). 

Purchase: Intend? 1. Try? 1. Consider? Maybe 2—he'd glance but dismiss it. But given his thoroughness (agrees), he might "consider" superficially but quickly reject. Still, "consider" is the highest bar here—maybe 2. 

Wait, the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree. For purchase: 
- Intend: 1 (no way)
- Try: 1 (won't even attempt)
- Consider: 2 (might briefly think then dismiss)

Ad attitude: 
- Like: 2 (slightly disagree)
- Interesting: 1 (strongly disagree)
- Good: 2 
- Attractive: 1

Yeah, that fits. He's critical, not persuaded. The ad feels irrelevant to his life stage and values.
