Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male character. He's under 20, married, with a surprisingly high monthly income of over 46 million VND as a blue-collar worker holding a bachelor's degree. Interesting contradiction there - blue-collar jobs in China rarely pay that much, but I'll roll with the given profile. 

His personality traits paint a vivid picture: super talkative (Strongly Agree) yet weirdly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable while strongly disagreeing with being reserved. That's contradictory but suggests he's chatty in specific contexts. He's extremely helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), generally trusting but gets nervous easily (Agree), yet claims to be emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) - another tension point. The "original, come up with new ideas" Strongly Agree stands out for a blue-collar worker, and he agrees he has few artistic interests.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a young married blue-collar worker, he's probably physically exhausted from labor-intensive work. The "stay energized" part might hit home, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone in manual labor. His high income suggests he might not struggle financially, but the bachelor's degree in blue-collar work is odd - maybe he's in a specialized technical trade?

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like the ad? He's talkative and helpful, so he might appreciate straightforward messaging, but the ad feels generic. Score 4 (Neutral-leaning-positive) since energy claim could resonate with his tiredness.
- Interesting? His originality trait (Strongly Agree) means he'd want innovative angles, but this ad is clich√©. Probably 3 (Disagree).
- Good? He does thorough work (Neutral) but isn't careless (Strongly Disagree), so he'd spot vagueness. "Helps you stay energized" lacks proof. Score 3.
- Attractive? With few artistic interests (Agree), visual appeal matters less. Generic health claims won't impress. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? He's trusting (Agree) but nervous (Agree) - might doubt claims. Blue-collar workers often prefer practical solutions over drinks. Score 2.
- Try to buy? His helpful nature might make him willing to test for family, but "look your best" feels irrelevant. Maybe 3.
- Consider buying? Neutral on worrying, so he might entertain it if energy claim seems plausible. Score 4.

Wait - his emotional stability (Strongly Agree) contradicts "get nervous easily" (Agree). Maybe he manages anxiety well? Still, the ad's lack of specifics would trigger his thoroughness (Neutral) and non-carelessness (Strongly Disagree). He'd want evidence, not slogans. 

Also noting: married young with high income - possibly in a lucrative trade like electronics manufacturing? Might prioritize family over personal appearance, making "look your best" less compelling. The energy angle could work for shift work though. 

Final adjustment: since he's talkative but not sociable, he might share the ad with others ("helpful" trait), but wouldn't buy it himself. Purchase scores stay low. Ad attitude slightly higher because he's trusting, but not by much.
