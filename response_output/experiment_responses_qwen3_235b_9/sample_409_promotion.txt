Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a Chinese male over 60 with high school education, single, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly talkative but disagree with being outgoing/sociable - that's interesting, maybe I talk a lot but only with close people? I strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, which suggests I'm quite guarded. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who worries a lot (I agree with that trait) and isn't emotionally stable, I might be skeptical about such broad claims. The ad feels too generic - "look your best" is vague. With my tendency to be careless (I agree with that) but also make thorough plans (strongly disagree), I'd probably dismiss this as superficial.

My personality says I have few artistic interests (strongly agree) and am not very original (neutral), so flashy marketing won't work on me. Since I'm not trusting and unselfish, I'd assume this is just sales gimmickry. The "energized" claim might actually stress me out more since I worry a lot. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? No, too salesy (1)
- Interesting? Not really, seen this a million times (2)
- Good? Feels dishonest (1)
- Attractive? Doesn't appeal to my practical side (2)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1)
- Will try? Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely (2)
- Consider? Only if there's concrete evidence, which this ad lacks (3)

The high income doesn't matter here because the ad fails to address my skepticism. If it showed clinical studies or had trusted endorsements (which I'd still doubt), maybe. But as is? Total no.
