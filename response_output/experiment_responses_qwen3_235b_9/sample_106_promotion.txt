Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male civil servant over 60 with a postgraduate degree. His monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which feels high for Vietnam but I'll take it as given). Key personality traits: extremely reserved (Strongly Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree meaning he IS unstable), but also very thorough and plan-oriented (Strongly Agree on both). Crucially, he's not talkative or sociable at all.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's reserved, not imaginative, and worries excessively... this feels superficial. His civil service background means he values substance over flash. At his age (>60), "look your best" might even feel age-insensitive - older people often find such claims unrealistic or patronizing. 

His strong thoroughness trait makes me think he'd demand evidence. No mention of ingredients or clinical trials? Big red flag. His emotional instability combined with worrying tendency means vague health claims might actually increase anxiety rather than appeal to him. "Stay energized" sounds like a sugar-laden energy drink - completely against what a health-conscious elderly person would want.

Also noting his marital status and high income: he probably has someone cooking proper meals for him. Why would he need a magic drink? The ad feels targeted at young professionals, not retirees. His "few artistic interests" (Strongly Disagree) suggests he appreciates concrete utility, not aspirational fluff.

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Absolutely not (1). Feels manipulative.
- Interesting? Only as a bad example (2). 
- Good? Fails basic credibility (1). 
- Attractive? Visuals don't matter when content is poor (1).

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend to purchase? Never (1). 
- Will try? Only if forced (1). 
- Consider? Maybe if it had proof, but this ad gives none (2).

The only saving grace is his trusting nature (Strongly Agree), but that's overridden by his thoroughness and worry tendencies. He'd need scientific data, not slogans.
