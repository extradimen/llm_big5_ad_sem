Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual persona. She's a young Chinese female office worker under 20, living with parents, earning decently for her age (36-45M VND/month - which actually feels high for a high school grad but maybe it's a special context). 

Hmm... her personality traits are very telling. She's strongly outgoing/sociable but strongly disagrees with being talkative? Interesting contradiction - maybe she's the quiet-but-present type at social gatherings. More crucially: she strongly agrees with being sometimes rude, careless, and nervous, while disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish. This paints someone who's socially active but emotionally volatile, possibly impulsive. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me unpack why this might rub her wrong:

First, her "strongly agree" on being careless + "strongly disagree" on thoroughness means she'd likely skim the ad without scrutinizing claims. But her "strongly agree" on nervousness/worrying makes her skeptical - she'd probably think "Another fake energy drink promise? My boss said Red Bull scams people." 

Also notable: she has artistic interests (disagrees with "few artistic interests") and original ideas, so generic "look your best" phrasing feels shallow to her creative side. And since she's rude sometimes? She might internally mock the ad: "Ugh, another basic influencer ad. Do they think I'm dumb?"

For purchase intention... even though she's sociable (might care about appearance), her low trust ("neutral" on trusting) and high neuroticism ("disagree" on emotionally stable) would override that. She'd think: "Maybe it works for others but I'll just get jittery and waste money." 

Wait - her income is high for her age, but she lives with parents so no rent pressure. Still, her carelessness trait means she wouldn't budget for unproven products. And "strongly disagree" on helpful/unselfish? She's not buying this to impress others either. 

*Scoring rationale:*
Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because 
- "Like" (1): She'd actively dislike the clich√© 
- "Interesting" (2): Barely holds attention due to rudeness trait 
- "Good" (2): Sees it as low-effort advertising 
- "Attractive" (3): Might acknowledge pretty model but rolls eyes 

Purchase intention: All near-bottom (1-2)
- "Intend" (1): Zero planning tendency ("strongly disagree" on following plans) 
- "Try" (1): Carelessness + nervousness = avoids new things 
- "Consider" (2): Only because she's imaginative (might fantasize "what if" for 5 seconds)
