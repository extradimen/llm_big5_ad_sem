Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 30-39yo Chinese male with specific traits. High school education, lives with parents, makes 26-35M VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's quiet (Strongly Disagree on talkative), somewhat sociable but very reserved (Agree/Strongly Agree), not helpful or trusting (Disagree/Disagree), actually rude (Strongly Agree), messy with work (Strongly Disagree on thorough job), impulsive (Strongly Disagree on following plans), but weirdly not careless (Strongly Disagree) - that's contradictory but okay. Nervous (Agree), anxious (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), creative (Agree/Agree), and artsy (Strongly Disagree on few interests).

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Gotta evaluate it through his lens.

First, attitude toward ad:
- Like? He's reserved, rude, distrustful. Probably thinks it's fluffy corporate nonsense. Strong dislike → 1
- Interesting? He worries a lot, has active imagination but low trust. Might see through the vagueness → 2 (barely)
- Good? "Good" implies effectiveness/credibility. He's emotionally unstable and distrustful → 1
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but he's rude and untrusting. Won't buy the "look your best" claim → 1

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Zero trust in products. Makes 26-35M VND (~$1,000) but lives with parents - no urgency. Strongly Disagree → 1
- Try to buy? Impulsive? No, he's careless but not impulsive (contradiction in traits, but "make plans" is Strongly Disagree so maybe impulsive? Wait no - he's careless but Strongly Disagree on "tend to be careless" so actually not careless? Messy with work but not careless... confusing. Anyway distrust overrides → 1
- Consider buying? Might glance but his anxiety + distrust kills it. "Look your best" feels manipulative to someone insecure → 2

Wait, income is decent but lives with parents - no need for status products. "Look your best" might trigger his anxiety but he'd reject it as fake. Also rude/unhelpful so no FOMO.

Scores should be brutally low. Only "consider" might get a 2 since he's creative and might imagine alternatives, but nah - he's too distrustful.
