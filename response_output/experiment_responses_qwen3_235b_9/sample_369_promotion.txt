Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 20-29 year old Chinese male civil servant with postgraduate education. His income is high (>46M VND/month) but he lives with parents - that suggests conservative spending habits despite earning capacity. Key personality points: strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable yet reserved (interesting contradiction), strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish, but disagrees with being generally trusting. Also agrees he gets nervous easily but strongly disagrees with worrying a lot - so situational anxiety without chronic worry. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant in China, I'd be skeptical of such broad health claims. My "disagree" on general trust and "neutral" on thoroughness means I'd question the scientific backing. The high income doesn't make me impulsive - living with parents implies family-influenced caution. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic. No cultural relevance for a Chinese audience. My "neutral" on talkative means I won't engage with shallow ads.
- Interesting (2): "Stay energized" might catch attention briefly (outgoing trait), but "look your best" feels superficial for my reserved side. 
- Good (1): As a postgraduate, I value evidence. This lacks substance - contradicts my "disagree" with carelessness.
- Attractive (2): Minimalist claim might appeal to my artistic interests ("agree" on few artistic interests), but feels cheap.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Civil servants avoid unverified health products. My "strongly disagree" on worrying means I don't feel urgent need.
- Try (2): Might sample if free (helpful/unselfish trait could make me share with family), but won't seek it out.
- Consider (3): Only if colleagues recommend (outgoing/social trait), but my trust issues require strong proof first.

Noting contradictions: Outgoing yet reserved means I'd discuss ads socially but not act on them. High income but living with parents = value-driven, not status-driven purchases. The ad's vagueness fails my civil servant scrutiny.
