Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male under 20 with the given demographic and personality traits. Interesting contradictions here - a bachelor's degree holder working as a managerial employee while divorced at under 20? That seems unusual but I'll work with the parameters provided. 

Looking at the personality traits that matter most for ad evaluation:
- Strongly Agree on talkative but Strongly Disagree on outgoing/sociable? That's paradoxical but suggests someone who talks a lot but not in social settings - maybe online or work-related. 
- Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish tells me this person is self-focused.
- Strongly Agree on trusting but also Agree on getting nervous easily - seems like naive optimism mixed with anxiety.
- Strongly Agree on thorough job but Neutral on following plans? Suggests meticulous but inflexible.
- Strongly Agree on active imagination but Strongly Disagree on originality? Contradictory - probably enjoys consuming ideas but not creating.

For the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day":
- As someone unselfish (Strongly Disagree), he wouldn't care about "looking best" as a social signal
- His high trust (Strongly Agree) might make him believe it, but nervousness (Agree) could trigger skepticism
- Being meticulous (Strongly Agree) would notice lack of evidence in the claim
- Divorced under 20 suggests possible impulsivity, but high thoroughness counters that

Ad attitude considerations:
1. Like: Generic claim won't impress an imaginative (Strongly Agree) but unoriginal person. Probably neutral-negative.
2. Interesting: "Look your best" might trigger his imagination, but no concrete details. Maybe 3-4.
3. Good: As thorough worker, he'll see it as lazy advertising. Likely low score.
4. Attractive: With few artistic interests (Disagree), visual appeal matters less. Neutral at best.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Unselfish trait (Strongly Disagree) means no motivation to buy for others, and he's skeptical. Hard no.
2. Try: Might experiment if cheap, but 16-25M VND income is high - he can afford to be picky. Unlikely.
3. Consider: Only possible if ad provided evidence, which it doesn't. Maybe minimal openness.

The personality contradictions are key here. His imagination might momentarily engage with "look your best" but thoroughness kills it. High trust battles with nervous skepticism. Ultimately the ad's vagueness fails his meticulous nature.

Final scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude all low (2-3) due to lack of substance
- Purchase intention near-zero except maybe "consider" at 2 since he's trusting
- Must avoid overrating despite high income - he's too detail-oriented for empty claims
