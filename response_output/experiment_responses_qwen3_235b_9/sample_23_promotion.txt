Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male profile: 40-49, divorced, bachelor's degree, high income (26-35M VND/month â‰ˆ $1,000-$1,400 USD), but with very specific personality traits. Key points stand out - he's strongly talkative (7) but emotionally unstable (2), strongly disagrees with being thorough (1) yet agrees he's sometimes rude (5). Interesting contradictions here: outgoing but nervous, helpful but untrusting. 

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone with his traits, I should consider:
- His high nervousness (7/7) and emotional instability (2/7) might make "stay energized" sound risky - could trigger anxiety. 
- Strong disagreement with thoroughness (1/7) suggests he'd dismiss vague claims without evidence. 
- General distrust (1/7) means he'd question "look your best" as unrealistic.
- Being talkative (7/7) but untrusting (1/7) - he might mock the ad to friends as "typical marketing fluff."

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd hate the oversimplification. Divorced, high-earning men his age see through "look your best" claims.
- Interesting (2): Maybe briefly, but distrust kills engagement.
- Good (1): "Good" implies effectiveness - he'd rate poorly without proof.
- Attractive (1): Visual appeal won't override skepticism.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero. His "sometimes rude" trait (5) might make him scoff at the ad.
- Try (2): Only if peer pressure, but distrust overrides.
- Consider (3): Bare minimum - he's careless (4) but emotionally unstable (2), so maybe passive consideration without real intent.

Crucially, his income means he can afford it but won't waste money on unproven claims. The ad's vagueness clashes with his need for concrete value (despite disagreeing with thoroughness - interesting cognitive dissonance). 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude all 1-2, purchase intention barely above dismissal. Even "consider" is low because he's careless (neutral) but distrustful (strongly disagree).
