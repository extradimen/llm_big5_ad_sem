Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a Chinese female civil servant in her 30s-40s with a postgraduate degree, living with her parents, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix: I'm talkative and sociable but also nervous, worried, emotionally unstable, and somewhat rude. I don't trust people easily, am careless sometimes, and while I have an active imagination, I'm not very original or artistic.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate it based on my traits. 

First, attitude toward the ad. The ad is vague—no specifics on ingredients, how it works, or proof. As someone who's skeptical (strongly disagree on trusting) and nervous, I'd find it unconvincing. I worry a lot, so claims like "look your best" might trigger anxiety about unrealistic standards. Also, I'm sometimes rude and unhelpful, so I might roll my eyes at such generic marketing. Even though I'm sociable, this ad doesn't engage me. So scores for like, interesting, good, attractive should be low. Maybe 2 or 3? But since I'm critical, probably 2 across the board.

Purchase intention. I'm careless and emotionally unstable—might impulse buy? But wait, I'm a civil servant with high income, so maybe I'm cautious. The ad lacks credibility, and I strongly disagree on trusting. I wouldn't believe the claims. Also, as someone who's not unselfish (disagree on helpful/unselfish), I might prioritize myself, but the ad doesn't resonate. No intention to buy. Scores should be low. Maybe 1 for intend and try, but "consider" could be a tiny bit higher? But given my skepticism, probably all 1s or 2s. Since I'm critical, sticking with 1s makes sense.

Wait, the instructions say it's okay to like the ad but not buy, or vice versa. But in this case, I dislike the ad and won't buy. So ad attitude scores low, purchase intention also low.

Double-checking traits: Strongly disagree on trusting, so ad feels manipulative. Nervous and worries a lot—might see "look your best" as pressuring. Not original/artistic, so no appeal there. Active imagination but not triggered by this bland ad. 

So ad attitude: all 2s? Or 1s? Since I strongly disagree on trusting, and the ad is generic, probably 1s. But "attractive" might be slightly higher? No, as a civil servant, I value substance. The ad has none. So all 1s for attitude? But the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree. For "I like the ad," 1 means strongly dislike. Yes.

Purchase intention: 1 for all, since no credibility and I'm skeptical.

But let's see the example response they gave in the problem. Wait, no example, but instructions say low scores are fine. 

Final decision: ad attitude all 1s, purchase intention all 1s. But maybe "consider" is a 2? Hmm. Given I'm careless (strongly agree), maybe I'd consider it on a whim? But no—careless in execution, not in judgment. My worry and distrust override. So all 1s.
