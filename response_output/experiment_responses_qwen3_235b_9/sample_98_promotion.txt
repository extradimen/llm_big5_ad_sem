Alright, let me tackle this user's query step by step. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree working in an office. His income is in Vietnamese Dong, which is a bit confusing since he's Chinese, but I'll roll with it. 

First, I need to internalize his personality traits. He strongly disagrees with being talkative or sociable, so he's probably quiet and keeps to himself. But he strongly agrees with being helpful and unselfish, yet also strongly agrees with being sometimes rude. That's interesting—maybe he's blunt but has a good heart. He's neutral on emotional stability and worries, so he might be calm but pragmatic. He agrees with being original but neutral on artistic interests, so he might value practical creativity.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a 60+ office worker, "look your best" might feel irrelevant—older folks often care more about health than appearance. And "stay energized" could resonate since energy levels drop with age, but the ad feels too vague. No specifics on how it works or ingredients. Given his strong distrust (he disagrees with being generally trusting), he'd probably see this as empty marketing fluff. 

Also, his trait "I tend to be careless" (strongly agree) suggests he might overlook small details, but the ad's lack of substance would still bother him because he's not trusting. Plus, he's neutral on doing thorough jobs, so he won't dig deeper to verify claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": He'd dislike it—too flashy, not credible. Score 1. 
- "Interesting": Nah, it's generic. Score 2. 
- "Good ad": Feels manipulative. Score 1. 
- "Attractive": Doesn't appeal to his values. Score 1. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase": Zero trust. Score 1. 
- "Will try": Maybe if pressured, but unlikely. Score 2. 
- "Will consider": Only if more proof, but ad gives none. Score 2. 

Wait—his income is high (26-35M VND/month ≈ $1,000-$1,400), but he's frugal? Not specified. Still, without credibility, money won't sway him. And "look your best" might even annoy him—older men often reject vanity-focused ads. 

Double-checking traits: He agrees he's original, but the ad isn't innovative. Neutral on artistic interests, so no emotional pull. Strongly rude? Might dismiss it harshly. Yep, scores stay low.
