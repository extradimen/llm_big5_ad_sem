Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male student. He's 30-39, lives with parents, earns 16-25M VND monthly (which is actually high for a student in Vietnam - maybe he's a grad student or has side income?), high school education but still studying. Personality is interesting: strongly agrees he's outgoing/sociable AND reserved? That's contradictory but maybe he's selectively social. Strongly disagrees with "thorough job" and "careless" - so he's inconsistent? Agrees he's talkative but reserved... hmm, perhaps he's sociable in familiar settings but private otherwise. Emotionally stable (strongly agree), not artistic, not original.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? He's outgoing but reserved - might find it too bland. Neutral (4) since he's emotionally stable won't get excited easily. 
- Interesting? He has active imagination but low artistic interest. Probably not (3). 
- Good? He doesn't do thorough jobs (strongly disagree) so won't analyze ad quality deeply. Neutral (4). 
- Attractive? Reserved guy + no artistic interest = low visual appeal (3).

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? He's helpful but not trusting (neutral). Suspicious of "look your best" claims. Strong no (2). 
- Will try? Might sample if cheap/free, but monthly income is decent (16-25M VND is ~$650-1000 USD) - but as a student living with parents, probably frugal. Unlikely (3). 
- Will consider? Only if he sees concrete evidence, which ad lacks. Barely (3).

Noting contradictions in his traits: "outgoing" vs "reserved" suggests he's picky about social contexts. The ad's vagueness won't resonate. His "emotionally stable" trait means no FOMO, and "not original" implies he won't imagine personal benefits from the ad. Also, "do a thorough job: strongly disagree" means he won't research the product - so ad must convince instantly, which it fails to do.

Final scores reflect skepticism from neutral trust level + lack of concrete info in ad. High income bracket but student status = price sensitivity still applies.
