Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male civil servant with high school education, living with parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm talkative but reserved (interesting contradiction), highly trusting yet nervous, practical with few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant with stable routine, "energized" feels irrelevant - my job isn't physically draining. "Look your best" triggers my insecurity since I'm nervous and emotionally neutral. 

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: 
  *Like?* (1-7) I'm reserved and unartistic - flashy ads annoy me. Score 2. 
  *Interesting?* Originality isn't my thing (Strongly Disagree on imagination), so generic claims bore me. Score 1. 
  *Good?* As a careful worker (Disagree on carelessness), I need proof. "Helps" is vague. Score 2. 
  *Attractive?* Few artistic interests (Strongly Agree) means plain visuals appeal more. This feels commercial. Score 1.

- Purchase intention:
  *Intend?* I don't follow plans (Disagree on plans), but need strong reason. No medical claims = no. Score 1. 
  *Try?* Trusting (Strongly Agree) but nervous about new things (Strongly Agree on nervous). Stalemate? Still, civil servants avoid risks. Score 2. 
  *Consider?* Neutral on thoroughness, but "look your best" conflicts with my reserved nature. Might glance at ingredients... eventually. Score 3.

Noting key tensions: 
- High trust vs. job-cautioned skepticism 
- Talkative but reserved = won't discuss ads 
- Original ideas (Agree) but hates artistic fluff â†’ ad feels shallow

Final scores reflect practical civil servant mindset: rejects hype, needs substance, won't gamble income on vague promises. Scores low but not zero because... well, maybe if mom asks me to buy it?
