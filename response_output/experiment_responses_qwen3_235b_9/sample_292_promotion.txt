Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male civil servant. First, I need to fully embody his demographic and personality traits. He's a single man with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant earning under 15 million VND monthly—so modest income, probably frugal. His personality shows he's talkative but not super outgoing, helpful, trusting, but careless and emotionally unstable. He disagrees with being original or artistic.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, for someone his age, "stay energized" might resonate because older adults often feel tired. But "look your best" feels more targeted at younger people or vanity-focused folks. Given he's not into artistic interests and isn't original, he might see this as superficial. 

His traits say he's careless and emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable), so he might not trust flashy claims. Civil servants in China are practical; they value substance over hype. Also, his income is low—15 million VND is about $600 USD, so he's budget-conscious. He'd question if this drink is worth the cost. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like: He's helpful and trusting but careless. Might find it trying too hard. Probably neutral to negative. Score 3.
- Interesting: He's not imaginative, disagrees with originality. The ad seems generic. Score 2.
- Good: As a thorough worker (he agrees with doing thorough jobs), he'd want proof. No evidence here. Score 2.
- Attractive: He agrees he has few artistic interests, so visual appeal won't sway him. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Low income, skeptical. Strongly disagrees with following plans, so impulse buys unlikely. Score 1.
- Try: He's careless but emotionally unstable—might try once but not committed. Still, low trust in ads. Score 2.
- Consider: Practical civil servant might think "maybe if cheap," but ad lacks credibility. Score 3.

Wait, his "worry a lot" is strongly disagreed, but he gets nervous easily. Contradiction? Maybe he worries in specific ways. Still, the ad feels untrustworthy to him. No mention of ingredients or science—just vague promises. As a civil servant, he'd prefer official, factual ads. 

Also, "look your best" clashes with his single status and age—he might feel it's irrelevant. Older Chinese men often prioritize health over appearance. The ad misses the mark. 

Double-checking scores: Ad attitude all low (3,2,2,2), purchase intention very low (1,2,3). Makes sense for his profile.
