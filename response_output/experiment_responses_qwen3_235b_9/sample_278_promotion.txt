Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to fully embody the given demographic and personality profile. The user is a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show contradictions - she's sociable but strongly reserved, emotionally stable yet worries a lot, highly original but uninterested in art. 

Hmm... the ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's strongly agree she worries a lot but is emotionally stable, she'd probably scrutinize this claim carefully. The vagueness of "look your best" might trigger her worrying tendency - she'd wonder "best how? What evidence?" 

Noting she strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish but strongly agrees with being original... this suggests she values authenticity over altruism. The ad's generic phrasing would feel like empty marketing to her creative mind. She'd think "Another superficial promise? Where's the proof?"

Her strong disagreement with "make plans and follow through" but strong agreement with "do a thorough job" is interesting. She's meticulous but impulsive - so while she'd research the product thoroughly, the ad alone wouldn't convince her to buy. 

Ah! Crucial point: she strongly agrees she's careless. This means she'd actually need EXTRA convincing to trust a health-related claim. "Energized" sounds too good to be true for someone who admits carelessness - she'd fear side effects.

For purchase intention: her high income means affordability isn't the issue. But with her artistic disinterest and originality, she'd dismiss this as "mainstream nonsense." Still, since she's trusting (strongly agree), she might weakly consider it after independent verification.

*Scoring rationale:*
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too generic for her creative mind
- Interesting (3): Slightly piques curiosity but feels shallow
- Good (2): Poor credibility for a worrier
- Attractive (1): Visually bland per her art disinterest

Purchase: 
- Intend (1): Zero impulse buy tendency
- Try (2): Might if peer-reviewed evidence appears
- Consider (3): Only after heavy research
