Okay, let me step into this role. I'm a 25-year-old Chinese male civil servant with a high school education, married, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative (Strongly Agree) but also reserved (Agree), which is interesting - maybe I'm sociable in professional settings but private personally. I strongly disagree with being unselfish or trusting, and strongly agree with being thorough and plan-oriented. I'm also highly original but uninterested in arts.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant with meticulous work habits (Strongly Agree on thoroughness), I'd immediately question vague claims. "Look your best" feels superficial - I strongly disagree with having artistic interests, so appearance-focused messaging won't resonate. The energy claim might catch my attention since I make plans and follow through (Strongly Agree), but without concrete evidence... 

My distrust is extreme (Strongly Disagree on trusting). This ad gives zero proof - no ingredients, no studies. Just empty promises. As someone who "tends to be careless" (Strongly Disagree), I'd actually be annoyed by such lazy advertising. It clashes with my value of doing thorough jobs. 

For purchase intention: Even if I liked the ad (which I won't), my unselfishness trait is "Disagree" - meaning I'm self-focused, but this product seems irrelevant to my civil servant routine. Morning tea or coffee would be more credible for energy. "Look your best" feels like vanity I don't have (Strongly Agree on few artistic interests). 

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: All scores low. No like (1) because it's flimsy. Not interesting (2) since I have active imagination "Strongly Disagree" - I prefer concrete things. Not good (1) due to lack of credibility. Not attractive (1) as it ignores my practical nature.
- Purchase: Zero intention. "Intend" (1), "try" (1), "consider" (2) only because maybe if it were cheaper/more proven, but this ad gives no reason.

Wait - that "consider" score. Since I'm original (Strongly Agree), could the uniqueness tempt me? But no, the ad shows no innovation. Just generic claims. So 2 is generous; it's barely above "never".
