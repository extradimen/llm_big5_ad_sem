Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese male civil servant over 60 with particular personality traits and evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to internalize the demographic and psychological profile. This person is:
- Highly educated (bachelor's) but reserved and not sociable
- Earns well (36-45M VND/month) as a civil servant
- Extremely anxious ("strongly agree" to nervous/worries)
- Creative but uninterested in arts ("strongly agree" to original ideas but also "strongly agree" to few artistic interests - interesting contradiction)
- Deeply distrustful ("strongly disagree" to trusting)
- Not a planner ("strongly disagree" to following plans)

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... for someone with chronic anxiety, "stay energized" might actually sound alarming - he probably associates energy with nervousness. The "look your best" part feels superficial for a reserved civil servant who likely values substance over appearance. His distrust would make him skeptical of such vague claims. 

Also noting his marital status (single) and age (>60) - "look your best" might feel irrelevant when societal pressure about appearance diminishes at his age. His personality shows no vanity ("few artistic interests" suggests practicality). 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd dislike the ad's superficiality
- Interesting (2): Maybe minimally due to curiosity but distrust dominates
- Good (1): Poor execution for his values
- Attractive (1): Visually unappealing to his reserved nature

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero chance
- Try (2): Might reluctantly sample if free, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only hypothetically, given distrust

The income range is interesting - he could afford it, but his civil servant background suggests frugality. His "thorough job" neutrality implies he wouldn't waste money on unproven products. 

Biggest disconnect: The ad targets vitality, but his anxiety makes "energy" a negative. Should score purchase intent lower than ad attitude since he might tolerate bad ads but never buy.
