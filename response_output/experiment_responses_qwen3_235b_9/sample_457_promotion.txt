Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese female civil servant in her late teens/early 20s with a postgraduate degree. Her demographic shows high income (16-25M VND) but key personality traits stand out: she's reserved (Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), worrisome (Strongly Agree), and dislikes doing thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree). Crucially, she's not sociable (Strongly Disagree) and admits to sometimes being rude (Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who:
- Worry a lot (Strongly Agree) → might distrust vague health claims
- Not trusting of others (Neutral) → skeptical of commercial promises
- Has few artistic interests (Agree) → cares little about "looking best"
- Makes plans but careless (Agree/Disagree contradiction) → inconsistent follow-through

Her civil servant role adds layers: 
- Government workers often prioritize substance over marketing
- High education means she'll scrutinize unsupported claims
- Reserved nature makes "look your best" feel superficial

Breaking down ad attitude:
1. Like the ad? She'd dislike its superficiality (1-2) 
2. Interesting? Not for a worry-prone person seeking substance (1)
3. Good ad? Poor credibility given her skepticism (2)
4. Attractive? "Look your best" clashes with her reserved/artistic-disinterest traits (1)

Purchase intention:
- Zero trust in "energized/look best" claims (worry trait)
- Civil servant income is high but she's not materialistic (few artistic interests)
- "Sometimes rude" suggests low patience for marketing fluff

Final scores must reflect:
- Deep skepticism (worry trait + low thoroughness)
- Rejection of beauty-focused messaging
- Intellectual disdain as educated civil servant

*Adjusting for scale*: 
- Her Strongly Disagree on helpfulness means she won't buy into "helps you" framing
- Neutral trust → defaults to distrust for commercial ads
- "Careless" tendency paradoxically makes her scrutinize claims MORE due to worry

...Resulting in near-minimum scores across the board.
