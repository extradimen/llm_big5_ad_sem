Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, reviewing the demographic profile: Chinese female over 60, postgraduate education, office worker, divorced with high income (over 46M VND/month). Personality traits show strong contradictions - she's sociable but not talkative, unhelpful yet emotionally unstable, careless but plans thoroughly. Interesting combo.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a postgraduate office worker with financial security, generic health claims might feel shallow. Her "strongly disagree" on being helpful/unselfish and "agree" on being sometimes rude suggests she'd be skeptical of marketing fluff. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): She'd probably roll her eyes at such a vague claim. High-income educated women over 60 don't fall for "look your best" promises. Score: 2
- Interesting (Q2): Too generic. Her "disagree" on imagination means she won't engage with unoriginal concepts. Score: 1
- Good (Q3): Contradicts her "neutral" on thoroughness - she'd spot the lack of evidence. Score: 1
- Attractive (Q4): "Few artistic interests" but "disagree" on that trait? Wait no - she "disagrees" with "I have few artistic interests", meaning she actually has many. But still, minimalist ad won't impress. Score: 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Her "strongly disagree" on trusting others + high skepticism means zero intent. Score: 1
- Try (Q2): "Sometimes rude" suggests impatience with gimmicks. Why would she waste money? Score: 1
- Consider (Q3): Only possible slight openness here since she "agrees" on planning. But... "tend to be careless" overrides that. Score: 1

Wait, her "emotionally stable: disagree" is tricky. Might make her more vulnerable to "look your best" claims? But no - her high income and education would make her prefer evidence-based products. Plus divorced status suggests self-reliance. 

Final scores feel harsh but consistent with her traits. That "strongly agree" on being careless is misleading - actually means she admits to carelessness, so she'd dismiss ads quickly. Yep, all low scores make sense.
