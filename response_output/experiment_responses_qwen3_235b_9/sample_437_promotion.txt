Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 30-39 year old divorced Chinese female student with high school education. Her income is 16-25 million VND monthly - that's actually quite high for Vietnam (equivalent to $650-1000 USD), so she might be from a wealthy family or have side income since students typically don't earn this much. Interesting contradiction there.

Looking at her personality traits that really stand out:
- She strongly disagrees with being reserved (so paradoxically not shy despite disagreeing with being talkative/sociable)
- Strongly agrees with nervousness, worrying, and emotional instability
- Strongly agrees with having active imagination but agrees she has few artistic interests? That's contradictory - maybe she's imaginative but not in traditional arts?
- She's rude sometimes yet helpful? Complex personality.
- Strongly disagrees with trusting people and being emotionally stable - major red flags for ad receptiveness.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me analyze through her lens:

For ad attitude:
1. "I like the ad" - Given her distrust (strongly disagrees with trusting others) and tendency to worry, she'd probably see this as superficial. Score: 2 (disagree)
2. "Interesting" - Her active imagination might engage with the concept, but skepticism would dominate. Maybe 3 (slight disagreement)
3. "Believe it's good" - With her emotional instability and distrust, she'd question the claims. Strong 1 (strongly disagree)
4. "Attractive" - She agrees she's sometimes rude and has few artistic interests, so visual appeal might not sway her. Plus she's not sociable. Score: 2

For purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" - Her careless tendency (she agrees with this) and lack of planning (strongly disagrees with following through) means no concrete intent. Score: 1
2. "Will try to buy" - Despite being thorough at work (strongly agrees), her distrust and worry would prevent action. Score: 1
3. "Will consider" - Here's where her active imagination might play out - she could entertain the idea while doubting it. Given she's a student, maybe curious about energy benefits. Score: 3 (neutral leaning slightly positive)

Important nuances:
- As a divorced woman in conservative Chinese society, she might be sensitive about "look your best" implying appearance pressure
- Her high income suggests she could afford it but her student status may make her frugal
- Emotional instability + worrying = likely to overanalyze health claims
- "Helps stay energized" might appeal to student life but she distrusts such promises

Final calibration:
The scores must reflect her deep skepticism. Even "consider" is only a 3 because while imaginative, her strong distrust dominates. No score should exceed 3 given her personality profile.
