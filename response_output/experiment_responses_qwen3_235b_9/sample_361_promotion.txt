Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this specific Chinese woman in her 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker. That's an interesting contradiction - high education but manual labor, plus a surprisingly high income range (36-45 million VND is about $1,500-$1,900 USD, which is quite substantial for Vietnam). She's married, reserved, unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagrees), yet trusting and agreeable about being sometimes rude. Key traits: thorough, plan-oriented, careless (strongly disagrees), emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable?), highly imaginative and original but with few artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like the ad (1): As a reserved person who strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, she'd probably find this shallow. Her artistic disinterest and originality might make her dismiss it as clich√©. Strongly disagree (1) seems right.
- Interesting (2): Her active imagination might give it minimal points, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's thorough and plan-oriented. Maybe a 2.
- Good ad (1): She strongly disagrees with being careless and does thorough jobs - this ad lacks substance for her standards. Definitely 1.
- Attractive (1): Reserved personality + disagrees with being sociable would find "look your best" manipulative. 1 makes sense.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase (1): Her unselfishness disagreement suggests she wouldn't prioritize self-care products. High income but blue-collar job might mean practical spending. 1.
- Will try (2): Maybe out of curiosity since she's original, but her thoroughness would require proof. Slight chance = 2.
- Will consider (2): Same rationale as above - minimal consideration but not zero due to energy claim relevance to blue-collar work.

Noting contradictions: 
- She "disagrees" with being emotionally stable but also "disagrees" with worrying a lot? Might indicate volatile calmness. 
- High imagination but few artistic interests is unusual - perhaps practical creativity. 
- Makes me think she'd see through marketing fluff immediately.

The ad's vagueness ("this drink", no specifics) clashes with her thorough, plan-oriented nature. "Look your best" feels irrelevant to a reserved, unselfish person who's sometimes rude. Only the energy claim might have slight relevance to her blue-collar work, but without credibility markers, it won't sway her.

Final scores feel consistent with her profile: extreme skepticism on most aspects, minimal consideration due to possible energy benefit but no real purchase intent.
