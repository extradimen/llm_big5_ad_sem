Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. She's a 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education, living with parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show some contradictions - she agrees she's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing or reserved, which is confusing. She's not helpful/trusting (strongly disagrees), gets nervous easily (agrees), worries a lot (strongly agrees), and isn't thorough or imaginative. 

Hmm, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with anxiety tendencies (nervous + worrier), she'd probably be skeptical of such broad claims. The "look your best" part might trigger her insecurities but her low trust ("strongly disagree" on trusting others) means she won't buy into it. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): She dislikes manipulative ads (personality shows neutrality on rudeness but strong distrust)
- Interesting (2): Might glance but her "few artistic interests" and no imagination mean she won't engage
- Good (1): "Do a thorough job" is disagreed - she'd spot the lack of evidence
- Attractive (1): "Emotionally unstable" + "worry a lot" makes her avoid superficial promises

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Her income is decent but she's unselfish? Wait no - she "strongly disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish! But still, no trust in ads.
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity since she makes plans (agrees), but her anxiety would prevent action
- Consider (2): Only if pressured, but her "careless" neutrality might make her forget it instantly

*checks traits again* Oh! She "agrees" to being talkative but "strongly disagrees" to sociable? That's odd... probably means she talks but only in safe settings (like home). So she'd complain about the ad to parents but never act on it. 

Final scores must reflect her chronic distrust and anxiety. The ad feels like empty corporate nonsense to someone who "worries a lot" - she'd imagine hidden side effects or scams. Civil servant job also means she's seen enough regulations to spot dubious health claims. 

*adjusts scores* No way above 2 for anything. "Look your best" is especially triggering for an anxious, non-artistic person - she might feel it's mocking her plain lifestyle. Yeah... all lows make sense.
