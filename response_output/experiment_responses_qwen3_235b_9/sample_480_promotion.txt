Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate the ad based on the given demographic and personality profile. Let me start by understanding the user's profile.

The user is a Chinese male under 20, with a postgraduate degree. Wait, that's a bit odd because postgraduate degrees usually require being older, but maybe in some contexts it's possible. Anyway, moving on. He's single, has a monthly income under 15 million VND (which is about $600 USD, so not a high income), and his occupation is "Other". 

Personality traits: He's neutral on being talkative and outgoing, agrees he's reserved. Strongly agrees he's helpful and unselfish, but strongly disagrees with being generally trusting. Neutral on sometimes being rude. Strongly agrees he does a thorough job and strongly disagrees with being careless. Strongly disagrees with getting nervous easily, neutral on worrying a lot, agrees he's emotionally stable. Agrees he has an active imagination, strongly agrees he's original with new ideas, and strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each question.

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase.
2. I will try to buy.
3. I will consider buying.

Given his traits: He's reserved, not trusting (strongly disagrees with trusting others), does thorough work, not careless, emotionally stable. Also, he's original, creative, artistic. 

The ad is very generic. "Stay energized and look your best" – sounds like typical energy drink or health drink claims. Since he's not trusting (strongly disagrees), he might see this as vague and unconvincing. He does thorough work, so he'd want specifics – like what ingredients, how it works, evidence. Without that, he's skeptical.

Also, his income is under 15M VND (~$600), so he might be price-sensitive. But the ad doesn't mention price, so maybe not relevant here. But since he's a student (postgrad), maybe budget-conscious.

He's helpful and unselfish, but the ad is about personal benefit (look your best), which might not resonate with his unselfish trait. However, staying energized could help him be more productive for others, but the ad doesn't frame it that way.

Artistic interests: he strongly disagrees with having few, so he values creativity. The ad is bland and not creative, so he might find it unattractive.

Emotionally stable, not nervous – so "stay energized" might not appeal since he doesn't worry or get nervous. Maybe he doesn't feel the need for energy boosts.

Original ideas: he might dislike clichéd ads. This ad is very generic, so he'd probably think it's unoriginal.

So for ad attitude:
- Like: Probably low. He's critical, not trusting, ad is vague. Maybe 2 or 3.
- Interesting: Neutral or low. Doesn't stand out. Maybe 3.
- Good: He does thorough job, so without evidence, he'd think it's not a good ad. 2.
- Attractive: As someone with artistic interests, the ad is probably not visually or conceptually appealing. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: Very low. Doesn't trust the claim, no specifics. 1.
- Will try to buy: Maybe slightly higher if curious, but he's not careless, so won't try without reason. 2.
- Will consider: Maybe if there's more info, but ad alone isn't enough. Since he's thorough, he might consider if he researches, but ad itself doesn't prompt it. 3?

Wait, but he's reserved and not trusting. So even considering might be low. However, "consider" is a lower bar. Maybe 3.

Let me cross-check. Strongly disagrees with trusting others, so ad's claim is met with skepticism. Strongly agrees with doing thorough job, so he'd need proof. Ad provides none. So purchase intention should be very low.

Ad attitude scores: All low. Maybe like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=2.

Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2? Or consider=3? "Consider" might be a bit higher because even skeptics might think "maybe I'll look into it," but given his thoroughness, he might not even consider without more info. Hmm.

Wait, the instruction says: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy. You may dislike but still consider." So even if ad is bad, he might consider if product seems useful. But the ad doesn't give info, so no reason to consider.

But "consider" is a weak intention. Maybe 2 or 3.

Looking at similar cases: If someone distrusts an ad, they might not consider the product. But since he's thorough, he might research independently. However, the ad itself doesn't prompt that. So probably low.

Let me think of scores:

Ad attitude:
- Like: 2 (dislike)
- Interesting: 3 (neutral)
- Good: 2 (disagree)
- Attractive: 2 (disagree)

Purchase:
- Intend: 1
- Try: 1
- Consider: 2 (maybe slightly higher as a possibility, but still low)

But why interesting=3? Maybe because as someone with active imagination, he might find the concept of "look your best" a bit engaging, but the execution is poor. So neutral.

Alternatively, since he's original, he might find the ad cliché and thus not interesting. So interesting=2.

Wait, he strongly agrees he's original and comes up with new ideas, and strongly disagrees with few artistic interests. So the ad's lack of creativity would make it uninteresting. So interesting=2.

Adjusting:

Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=2, good=1, attractive=2.

But good=1? "Believe the ad is good" – as in quality of the ad. Since he's artistic and original, he'd think it's a bad ad. So 1.

But maybe 2. Let's see.

Alternatively, neutral on interesting (3) because he's neutral on worrying, but not sure.

Hmm. Let's go step by step.

1. I like the ad: He's reserved, not trusting, artistic. Ad is generic, so dislikes it. Score 2.
2. Interesting: As a creative person, he might find it uninteresting because it's cliché. But maybe slightly interesting? No, probably not. Score 2.
3. Believes ad is good: He does thorough work, so without evidence, he thinks it's a poor ad. Score 1.
4. Attractive: Artistic interests, so ad isn't visually or conceptually attractive. Score 2.

Purchase:
1. Intend: 1
2. Try: 1
3. Consider: He might consider if there's evidence elsewhere, but ad alone doesn't make him consider. However, "consider" is a low bar. Maybe 2.

But given his thoroughness, he might always consider products after research, but the ad itself isn't prompting it. So the ad's effect on consideration is low. Score 2.

Wait, the question is: "I will consider buying this product." Based on the ad. So if the ad doesn't provide enough, he won't consider. So 2.

Alternatively, maybe 3 if he's open-minded, but he's not trusting. So probably 2.

So final scores:

Ad attitude: [2,2,1,2]
Purchase: [1,1,2]

But let's check if "good" should be 2. Maybe he thinks the ad is mediocre. But "believe the ad is good" – as in quality. Since he's critical, probably 1 or 2. Given he strongly disagrees with trusting, and the ad is vague, he'd think it's a bad ad. So 1.

Yes. So ad_attitude_scores: [2,2,1,2]

Purchase: [1,1,2]

Wait, but the instruction says "use 7-point scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree". So for "I like the ad", 1 is strongly dislike, 7 strongly like. So lower scores mean negative.

Yes. So the scores I have are low, which makes sense.

Another angle: He's helpful and unselfish. The ad is about personal benefit ("look your best"), which might not appeal to his unselfish trait. So even less resonance.

Also, as a postgrad student, he might be more analytical, so the vague claim "helps you stay energized" without evidence turns him off.

Yes, so scores seem right.
