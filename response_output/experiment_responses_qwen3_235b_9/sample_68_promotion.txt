Okay, let me approach this step by step as the Chinese male office worker described. 

First, I need to fully embody this persona: 40-49 years old, divorced, postgraduate degree but low income (<15M VND/month), with specific personality traits. The key traits that jump out are: talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing (agree), reserved (disagree), unhelpful (strongly disagree), trusting (agree), nervous/worrier (both agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), artistic (strongly disagree). 

Hmm... this creates an interesting contradiction. He's sociable but not talkative? Actually looking closer - he's outgoing (agrees) but not reserved (disagrees), yet strongly disagrees with being talkative. That suggests he enjoys social settings but isn't the chatty type - maybe more of an observer. The high neuroticism (nervous, worrier) combined with emotional instability is crucial here. Also notable: he does thorough work but admits to being careless sometimes, and has artistic interests despite being an office worker.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 40s divorced Chinese office worker with anxiety issues and low income...

*Attitude toward ad:*
- "I like the ad" (Q1): Probably not. His artistic interests might make him appreciate creative ads, but this is extremely generic. With his neuroticism, he'd likely see through the vagueness. Score: 2
- "Interesting" (Q2): Same issue - no concrete info. As a worrier, he'd question what "look your best" even means. Score: 2
- "Good ad" (Q3): For credibility? His thoroughness trait makes him value substance. This ad has none. But he's trusting... though his nervousness might override that. Score: 3
- "Attractive" (Q4): Visually? The text gives no description, but his artistic side might expect better. Still, he's emotionally unstable - might feel the ad's promise is mocking his reality. Score: 2

*Purchase intention:*
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): Low income + anxiety about money. He'd calculate cost vs. vague benefits. And "helps look your best" might trigger insecurity given his age/divorced status. Score: 1
- "Will try to buy" (Q2): Maybe if stressed at work? But he's careless sometimes - might forget. However, his thoroughness suggests he researches before buying. Score: 2
- "Will consider" (Q3): Only if there were evidence. His neuroticism would make him overanalyze possible side effects. But trusting nature creates slight opening. Score: 3

Noticing contradictions in his traits: trusting but nervous, thorough but careless. The ad's vagueness would trigger his worrying tendencies - "how does it work? Is it safe?" His artistic interests aren't engaged at all by this bland copy. And crucially: as a divorced man in his 40s with money worries, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even depressing.

*Final adjustment:* His strong disagreement with being helpful/unselfish suggests cynicism - he'd assume the ad is manipulative. But since he's trusting... maybe 50/50. Leaning toward skepticism because of his anxiety. All scores stay low.
