Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not talkative or sociable (strongly disagree with outgoing), but I'm helpful (agree) and worry a lot (agree). I'm emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), have an active imagination (agree), and am very original/creative (strongly agree) while having few artistic interests (strongly agree). 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy claims might resonate since I'm probably tired after shifts. But "look your best" feels off - I'm not concerned with appearance per my "few artistic interests" trait. The ad seems too vague; no specifics about ingredients or proof. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? (1-7) I'm reserved but creative, so flashy ads annoy me. Score low - maybe 2. 
- Interesting? My active imagination might engage, but it's too generic. Neutral 4. 
- Good? As a thorough worker (neutral trait), I'd want substance. Feels shallow. 3. 
- Attractive? With low sociability, I don't care about aesthetics. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? I worry a lot (agree) so I'd distrust health claims without evidence. 1. 
- Try? Maybe out of curiosity since I'm original (strongly agree), but income is tight (<15M VND). 2. 
- Consider? Only if it solved real fatigue, but "look your best" is irrelevant. Still 1.

Wait - my "helpful" trait means I might consider if it helps family, but the ad doesn't mention that. And as emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), I'm skeptical of "feel good" claims. Yeah, scores stay low.
