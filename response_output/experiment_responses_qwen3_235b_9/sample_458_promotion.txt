Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to evaluate the ad as this specific Chinese civil servant with the given profile and personality traits. 

First, reviewing the demographic: 20-29yo male, postgraduate civil servant in Vietnam earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Divorced, which might contribute to emotional sensitivity. His personality shows strong introversion (strongly disagrees with talkative/outgoing), high anxiety (strongly agrees with nervous/worries), but also strong imagination while disagreeing with being original. 

Noticing key contradictions: 
- He's a civil servant (implying discipline) but strongly disagrees with "do a thorough job" and "make plans"
- High anxiety yet strongly disagrees with being careless - interesting tension
- Neutral on helpfulness but distrustful (disagrees with trusting)

For the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day":
- As an anxious person who worries a lot, he'd be skeptical of such broad claims. "Look your best" feels superficial to a reserved civil servant
- His strong imagination might make him visualize negative scenarios (e.g., side effects) rather than benefits
- Disagreeing with "original ideas" suggests he prefers concrete evidence over marketing fluff
- Civil service background means he values substance - this ad lacks specifics about how it works

Ad attitude analysis:
1. Like: Unlikely. He's reserved, distrustful, and anxious. Vague claims would annoy him. Score 1.
2. Interesting: His active imagination might engage briefly, but distrust would override. Maybe 2.
3. Good: Civil servants appreciate thoroughness (which he claims not to have, but profession demands it). Ad feels lazy. Score 1.
4. Attractive: Disagrees with being outgoing - won't respond to superficial "look your best" messaging. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Zero. Anxious + distrustful + neutral on helpfulness = no commitment. Score 1.
2. Try: Might consider if evidence provided, but ad gives none. His "careless" disagreement means he won't risk it. Score 1.
3. Consider: Only if pressured, but civil servants follow protocols. This ad offers no rationale. Maybe 2 at best.

Final scores reflect his skepticism as an anxious, distrustful civil servant who values substance over empty promises. The ad's vagueness clashes with his professional background despite his self-reported lack of thoroughness.
