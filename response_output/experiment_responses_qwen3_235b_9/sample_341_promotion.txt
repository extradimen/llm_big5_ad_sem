Okay, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 60+ Chinese male with specific traits. First, his demographic: divorced, high school education, income around 16-25 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam - maybe he's retired with savings or has side income). Occupation "other" suggests he might be retired or doing informal work.

His personality is fascinatingly contradictory. He's talkative and sociable (agrees), but also strongly reserved? That's interesting - maybe he's selective about who he opens up to. Strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and strongly agrees to being sometimes rude. Hmm, this paints someone who's blunt, maybe a bit cynical after life experiences. Disagrees with being trusting too - divorce and aging might've made him guarded.

Notices he strongly disagrees with "doing a thorough job" but strongly agrees with "making plans and following through". Contradiction? Maybe he plans big things but cuts corners on execution. Emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable) yet doesn't get nervous easily? Complex emotional profile. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim. But for a 60+ man? 

Why he'd dislike it:
- "Look your best" feels vain/ageist. At his age, he's probably past caring about "looking best" - might even resent the implication he's not. 
- Energy claims might seem gimmicky. Older folks often distrust quick-fix health claims.
- His rudeness/trust issues: He'd sniff out "manipulative" marketing instantly. "Helps you stay energized" - yeah right, probably just sugar and caffeine.

Why no purchase intent:
- Income is decent but he's financially cautious (divorced, older). Why waste money on unproven drinks?
- Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish - he won't buy things to "improve himself" for others.
- Strongly disagrees with thoroughness - won't research if it works. If first impression is skepticism, he's done.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3). He might find it mildly interesting as a concept (3) but overall sees it as irrelevant fluff. "Attractive" is lowest (2) - the vanity angle offends his age group.

Purchase intention: All 1s. His traits scream "not for me": distrustful, rude to sales pitches, careless about product details. He'd dismiss it immediately.

Noticed he has "active imagination" but "few artistic interests" - so he might creatively mock the ad ("haha, makes me look 20 again?"), but not in a positive way. Definitely not swayed.
