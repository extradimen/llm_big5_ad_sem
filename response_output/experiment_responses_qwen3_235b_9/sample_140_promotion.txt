Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person with the given profile. 

First, I need to embody this Chinese male under 20, high school educated office worker who's divorced (interesting detail for his age) with very high income (over 46 million VND monthly). His personality traits are quite specific: super talkative (Strongly Agree), but neutral on being outgoing/reserved, which is contradictory but suggests he talks a lot but isn't necessarily social. He agrees he's sometimes rude and careless (Strongly Agree!), yet also Strongly Agrees he does thorough work - that's a messy combo. Nervous easily (Strongly Agree) but disagrees with worrying a lot? Hmm. And he Strongly Agrees he's original with new ideas.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like the ad? As someone who's rude/careless but talks a lot, he might find generic claims annoying. He'd probably roll his eyes at "look your best" since he's got artistic interests (Disagreed with "few artistic interests"). Score low.
- Interesting? His active imagination is Disagreed, but he's original - maybe he'd want something more creative than this bland claim. Neutral-low.
- Good ad? For a thorough worker (he Strongly Agrees), this vague ad lacks substance. He'd dislike the lack of specifics. Low score.
- Attractive? With artistic interests (he Disagreed with having few), he'd want better visuals/copy. But he's careless so maybe not picky... still, low.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? High income but careless/nervous - he might impulse buy, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who worries about credibility (he's trusting but also rude/careless). Probably not.
- Try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity since he's original, but ad gives zero reason to try. Unlikely.
- Consider buying? Only if he's desperate for energy, but he's emotionally stable (Agrees) so doesn't need it. And as a thorough worker, he'd research proper energy drinks instead of this vague claim.

Wait - his high income could make him dismissive of cheap energy drinks. And divorced at <20? Might make him cynical about "look your best" promises. 

Final scores should reflect skepticism: ad attitude all 2-3 range, purchase intention even lower except maybe "consider" at 3 since he's careless enough to occasionally impulse-buy.
