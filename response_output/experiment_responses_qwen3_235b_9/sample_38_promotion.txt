Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a Chinese male over 60, blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree - that's an unusual combo since advanced degrees typically lead to white-collar jobs, but maybe I switched careers later. Living with parents at this age suggests strong family ties or economic necessity despite my high income (>46M VND/month, which is very wealthy in Vietnam). 

Hmm, my personality traits paint a complex picture: super outgoing (Strongly Agree on sociable) but also Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish and Agree on being sometimes rude. Interesting contradiction - maybe I'm a blunt, no-nonsense person who values efficiency over politeness. The Strongly Agree on worrying a lot and Agree on being thorough suggests anxiety-driven perfectionism. And wow, Strongly Disagree on both originality AND artistic interests? That's rare - means I'm very practical with zero creative leanings.

Now looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker grinding physically, energy claims might hook me... but wait. My traits say I'm distrustful (Disagree on trusting) and worry a lot (Strongly Agree). I'd immediately think: "Another scammy energy drink? Probably full of sugar and chemicals." My thoroughness (Agree) means I'd demand proof - where's the clinical data? 

Also, "look your best" feels irrelevant. At 60+ with artistic interests Strongly Disagreed, vanity isn't my priority. I'm worried about joint pain or retirement savings, not appearance. And since I'm not helpful/unselfish, I won't care if it "helps others" - pure self-interest here. 

My high income means I can afford it, but my rudeness (Agree on sometimes rude) and distrust make me skeptical of marketing fluff. I'd scoff: "Drink won't fix aging. Just give me coffee." No emotional appeal here - my neutral emotional stability means ads don't sway me easily. 

For scores: 
Ad attitude? All low. It's boring (not interesting), feels manipulative (not good), and "look your best" is cringe for an old blue-collar guy (not attractive). Only "like" gets a 2 because... well, energy claim is somewhat relevant to my job. 

Purchase intention? Zero. I'll consider it only because I'm thorough (score 3), but "intend" and "try" are impossible with my distrust. That Strongly Agree on worrying means I'd fear side effects. 

*Double-checking*: 
- My postgraduate brain wants evidence, ad provides none â†’ distrust confirmed 
- Blue-collar reality: we drink tea or cheap coffee, not fancy energizers 
- Living with parents? Maybe they'd influence me, but ad doesn't target family use 

Yep, scores make sense. This ad screams "for young urbanites," not for a gruff old factory worker who reads research papers (postgrad brain) but hates "artistic fluff."
