Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person based on the detailed demographic and personality profile provided. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits are crucial here - he's strongly outgoing/sociable but also strongly disagreeing with being talkative or reserved, which is interesting. He disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly disagrees with being trusting, and strongly agrees with sometimes being rude. He's conscientious (agrees with thorough job and following plans) but emotionally sensitive (strongly agrees about getting nervous easily). He has an active imagination but disagrees about being original or having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as someone who's outgoing but not talkative (contradictory but okay), he'd probably care about social image since he's sociable. But he's also untrusting and sometimes rude - so he'd likely be skeptical of vague claims. The ad gives no specifics about how it works or what makes it special. 

For ad attitude:
- Like: He'd dislike generic claims. Strong skeptic due to "strongly disagree with trusting." Maybe 2.
- Interesting: His active imagination might engage with possibilities, but the ad is too shallow. Neutral 4? Wait no - he has artistic interests but disagrees with being original, so probably not captivated. Maybe 3.
- Good: As a thorough planner, he'd want substance. This ad feels lazy. 2.
- Attractive: Outgoing people care about looks, but "look your best" is too vague. His rudeness trait makes him dismissive. 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Zero trust in such claims. He's unselfish? No, he disagrees with that - so self-image matters but not enough to trust ads. 1.
- Try: Maybe if peer pressure exists, but he's not trusting. His conscientiousness makes him research first. 2.
- Consider: Only if there's social proof, but ad provides none. His nervousness might make him avoid unknowns. 2.

Wait - his high income (36-45m VND is top tier in Vietnam) means he can afford it, but his skepticism overrides that. Also "look your best" might appeal to his sociability, but the ad doesn't leverage that emotionally. 

Final adjustment: 
- Ad attitude scores should reflect his distrust (low) and sociability (mild positive). 
- Purchase intention near rock bottom because he's rude/untrusting and the ad gives no reason to believe it.
