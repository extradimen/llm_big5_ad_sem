Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic profile: I'm a Chinese female under 20, divorced high school graduate working as a managerial employee with high income (>46M VND/month). That's an unusual combination - very young divorcee with managerial position suggests either exceptional circumstances or possible misclassification, but I'll work with it.

Now examining personality traits critically:
- Strongly Agree with being reserved and nervous/worried
- Strongly Disagree with being helpful/unselfish and rude
- Neutral on talkative/careless/imagination
- Disagree with outgoing/originality
- Agree with trusting and few artistic interests
- Strongly Agree with thorough work but Strongly Disagree with planning

This paints a picture of someone: 
- Socially anxious (reserved, nervous, worrier)
- Not team-oriented (unhelpful/unselfish)
- Detail-focused but disorganized (thorough but no follow-through)
- Cautious yet trusting paradoxically

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Hmm... as a reserved, anxious person who worries a lot:
- "Stay energized" might trigger anxiety about overstimulation
- "Look your best" feels superficial - I've Strongly Disagreed with being unselfish but Agree with few artistic interests, so vanity isn't appealing
- No credibility markers in ad - as someone who "does thorough job" I'd question claims

For purchase intention:
- High income means affordability isn't issue
- But Strongly Disagree with "make plans and follow through" suggests impulsive resistance
- Strongly Agree with worrying - would research alternatives extensively

Ad attitude scoring rationale:
1. Like: 2 (reserved personality dislikes self-promotion)
2. Interesting: 3 (Neutral on imagination but ad lacks substance)
3. Good: 2 (thorough worker sees missing evidence)
4. Attractive: 2 (reserved + few artistic interests = unimpressed)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 1 (Strongly Disagree with planning = no commitment)
2. Try: 2 (trusting but worrier would fear side effects)
3. Consider: 3 (thorough job-doer might research, but low priority)

Noting contradictions: 
- Trusting yet anxious means initial openness but immediate doubts
- High income but managerial at <20 suggests possible family business - might value practicality over ads

Final scores reflect skepticism from reserved, worrier personality combined with thoroughness trait demanding proof. The ad's vagueness clashes with "does thorough job" tendency.
