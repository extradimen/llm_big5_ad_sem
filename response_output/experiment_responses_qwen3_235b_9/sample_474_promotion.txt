Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman living with my parents, high school education, low income under 15 million VND. My personality shows I'm reserved (Agree), nervous easily (Agree), but emotionally stable? Wait no - I Disagree on emotional stability, meaning I'm actually unstable. Interesting contradiction with "worry a lot" being Strongly Disagreed though. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's financially constrained and reserved, I'd probably be skeptical. My "tend to be careless" (Agree) might make me dismiss it quickly, but "do a thorough job" (Agree) suggests I'd still scrutinize it. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. I'm not outgoing and have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree), so flashy ads won't appeal. Maybe 2.
- Interesting? Neutral on trusting, but "active imagination" (Agree) could make me curious... but "rude to others" Neutral suggests politeness, so not interested. 3?
- Good? "Helpful/unselfish" (Agree) but ad feels superficial. With low income, I'd question value. 2.
- Attractive? "Few artistic interests" screams not visually persuaded. 1.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? <15M VND income - can't waste money on unproven drinks. 1.
- Will try? "Careless" (Agree) but "nervous easily" (Agree) makes me risk-averse. 1.
- Consider? Maybe... but "emotionally unstable" (Disagree on stability = unstable) + "worry a lot" contradiction (Strongly Disagreed) is confusing. Wait - "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" means I don't worry, but "nervous easily: Agree" suggests anxiety. Ugh. Either way, low credibility. 2.

*checks personality again* 
Ah! "Have few artistic interests: Strongly Agree" - so visual appeal means nothing. And "original ideas: Disagree" means I won't be swayed by "new" claims. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude should be super low. Purchase intention near zero except maybe "consider" at 2 since I'm helpful - might think "if it works for others..." but nah, with my income? No. 

*imagines scrolling past ad on WeChat* 
Yeah. 1s and 2s all around. The "look your best" part feels manipulative for someone living with parents - not a priority when you're not dating. Energy claim? Might be useful since I'm nervous (tired?), but no proof. Not buying.
