Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad from the perspective of a specific demographic and personality profile. The user provided a detailed profile: a Chinese woman over 60, with a bachelor's degree, currently a student (which is interesting because at that age, maybe she's pursuing further education?), living with parents, and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. Her personality traits are a mix—she's talkative but reserved, helpful, not trusting, thorough job-doer? Wait, no, she strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job, which is odd. She's organized (makes plans and follows through), nervous, worries a lot, not emotionally stable, but original with ideas and has artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to assess her attitude toward the ad. The scores are on a 7-point scale. Let me break it down.

1. **I like the ad.** She's talkative and helpful but reserved. The ad is very generic. As someone who worries a lot and isn't emotionally stable, she might find it too superficial. Also, she's not trusting (neutral on trust), so she might doubt the claims. Plus, she's reserved, so flashy ads might not appeal. But she's talkative—maybe she'd discuss it, but does she like it? Probably not. She also has artistic interests but the ad isn't creative. So, low score. Maybe 2.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The ad is very vague. No specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As someone who makes plans and follows through, she might prefer detailed info. But she's not thorough (strongly disagrees), so maybe she doesn't dig deep. However, she worries a lot and gets nervous—might be skeptical. Also, she's original but the ad isn't creative. So, not interesting. Score 2.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** "Good" here probably means effective or well-made. But she's critical (helpful but unselfish, yet not trusting). The ad lacks credibility. No evidence, just claims. She worries a lot, so she'd question it. Also, she's emotionally unstable, might be more sensitive to false claims. Strongly disagree with doing thorough jobs, but that doesn't mean she's gullible. Neutral trust, but leaning skeptical. So, low score. Maybe 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractive could mean visually or appealingly presented. But the ad is just a sentence. No imagery described. She has artistic interests (disagrees with having few), so she might appreciate aesthetics, but the ad is text-only and bland. As a reserved person, loud ads might not attract her. Also, she's over 60—maybe prefers traditional, trustworthy ads. This one feels modern and generic. Not attractive to her. Score 2.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** She's helpful and unselfish, but the product is for personal use. She worries a lot and isn't trusting, so she'd doubt the claims. High income (26-35M VND is decent in Vietnam), but she's a student living with parents—maybe not spending on such products. Also, she's over 60; energy drinks might not be her thing. She doesn't do thorough jobs, so impulse buy? But she makes plans, so probably not impulsive. Strongly disagrees with thorough job, but agrees with planning—contradiction? Maybe plans but doesn't execute well. Still, skeptical. No intention. Score 1.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Similar reasons. She worries about efficacy. As a student (older adult student?), maybe focused on studies, not energy drinks. Also, emotionally unstable—might avoid stimulants. No trust in ad. Score 1.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Even considering? She's original with ideas, but the ad doesn't provide reasons to consider. No specifics. She's helpful, but this is self-focused. Maybe if it helped others, but it's about looking best. Not aligned with her values. She's reserved, so not into vanity. Probably won't consider. But maybe a tiny bit because she's talkative—might hear others discuss it. But overall, unlikely. Score 2.

Wait, let me double-check. Her income is high for Vietnam (26-35M VND is about $1,000-$1,400, which is good), but she's a student living with parents—maybe the income is from family? Still, she might not prioritize such products. Also, at her age, "look your best" might not resonate; she might prefer health-focused claims. The ad is too vague. 

Personality: Strongly agrees with worrying a lot and getting nervous. So, she'd be cautious. Neutral on trust, but leaning distrustful here. Disagrees with being outgoing, so not influenced by social trends. 

Purchase intention scores should be very low. Maybe 1,1,2. But "consider" might be slightly higher if she's open-minded, but her traits suggest skepticism. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all 2s, purchase intention 1,1,2.
