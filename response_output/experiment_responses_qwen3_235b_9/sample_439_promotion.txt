Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, let's break down my profile. I'm a Chinese male, 20-29, postgrad degree but working as a blue-collar worker. Divorced, income under 15 million VND. Personality-wise: I'm talkative (Agree), but not outgoing or sociable (Disagree), not reserved (Disagree). Helpful/Unselfish is Neutral, trusting is Neutral, sometimes rude is Neutral. I do a thorough job? Disagree. Make plans and follow through? Neutral. Tend to be careless? Strongly Agree. Nervous easily? Disagree. Worry a lot? Strongly Disagree. Emotionally stable? Agree. Active imagination? Strongly Agree. Original ideas? Neutral. Few artistic interests? Agree.

Okay, so as a blue-collar worker with a postgrad degree, maybe I'm in a job that doesn't use my education, which could be frustrating. Income is low, so price-sensitive. Divorced, maybe stressed but emotionally stable per traits. Careless and not thorough—so maybe not detail-oriented. Active imagination but few artistic interests, so maybe practical but daydreamy.

The ad claims the drink keeps you energized and looking good. As a blue-collar worker, staying energized makes sense because physical jobs are tiring. But "look your best" might not resonate as much since blue-collar work is more about function than appearance. Also, with low income, I might be skeptical of ads making big claims, especially if the product is expensive.

Personality traits: Strongly Agree on careless, so maybe I don't pay much attention to ads. Disagree on worrying, so not anxious about health, but Agree on emotionally stable. Active imagination (Strongly Agree) might make me visualize the benefits, but Neutral on trusting means I'm skeptical.

Attitude toward the ad: 
1. Like the ad? Hmm, it's simple but maybe too vague. As someone careless, I might not engage deeply. Probably low score, like 2 or 3.
2. Interesting? Maybe a bit because of the energy claim, but "look your best" feels superficial for my job. Maybe 3.
3. Believe it's good? Neutral to low because ads often overpromise. I'm Neutral on trusting, so skeptical. Score 2.
4. Attractive? Not really. Blue-collar, divorced, not focused on looks. Plus, few artistic interests (Agree), so visual appeal might not hit. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Low income, skeptical of ads. Probably 1.
2. Will try to buy? Maybe if it's cheap, but ad doesn't mention price. Still, careless tendency might mean I don't follow through. Score 1.
3. Consider buying? Only if it's affordable and proven, but ad lacks details. Neutral might be 3, but since I'm careless, maybe not even consider. Score 2.

Wait, but active imagination (Strongly Agree) could make me curious. However, the ad is very generic. No specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As someone who's careless, I might not care to look up details. Also, divorced and blue-collar—priorities might be practicality and cost over appearance.

Also, the ad says "look your best," which for a blue-collar worker might not be relevant. They're more concerned with energy to get through the day. But the ad combines both, which might dilute the message. If it focused only on energy, maybe better. But as is, not compelling.

So final scores: Ad attitude low across the board. Purchase intention very low.
