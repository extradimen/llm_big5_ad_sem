Okay, I need to evaluate this ad as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the profile.

The person is a Chinese male under 20, which is interesting because he's a postgraduate degree holder but works as a blue-collar worker. That seems a bit contradictory since postgraduate degrees usually take several years, but maybe in some contexts it's possible. His monthly income is less than 15,000,000 VND, which is about $600-700 USD, so not very high. He's married, which at under 20 is young but possible in some cultures.

Looking at his personality traits:
- Strongly Disagree on being talkative, but Strongly Agree on being outgoing and sociable. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Usually, talkative and outgoing go together, but maybe he's sociable in actions but not words? Neutral on being reserved, so maybe he's selectively social.
- Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish, Disagree on trusting others. So he's not very altruistic and distrustful.
- Neutral on being sometimes rude.
- Disagree on doing a thorough job, Strongly Agree on making plans and following through, but Strongly Agree on being careless. That's conflicting—plans but careless execution? Maybe he plans but doesn't execute well.
- Strongly Agree on getting nervous easily, Disagree on being emotionally stable, Neutral on worrying a lot. So he's anxious.
- Agree on having an active imagination, Neutral on originality, Agree on having few artistic interests. So imaginative but not artistic.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, as this person, how would I react?

First, attitude toward the ad:
1. Like the ad: He's not very trusting (Disagree on trusting), so he might see this as a typical exaggerated ad. Also, he's not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), so maybe he's cynical. Probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.
2. Interesting: He has an active imagination (Agree), so maybe he finds it somewhat interesting, but the ad is very generic. Neutral? But he's careless and not thorough, so might not engage deeply. Maybe 3.
3. Believes it's good: He's distrustful and anxious, so likely thinks it's not credible. Strongly Disagree on thorough job, so he might think the ad is lazy. Probably low, like 2.
4. Attractive: He's outgoing (Strongly Agree), but the ad doesn't seem to appeal to sociability. It's about energy and looks. He's anxious and careless, so maybe not attracted to it. Also, few artistic interests (Agree), so visual appeal might not matter. Score around 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He's untrustworthy of others, so he won't believe the claims. Income is low, so maybe not willing to spend on something unproven. Strongly Disagree on helpful, so self-interested but skeptical. Probably 1.
2. Will try to buy: Even if he considers, his anxiety and distrust might prevent action. Score 1.
3. Will consider buying: Maybe a bit higher, but still low because he's careless and not thorough. He might not even think about it. But Neutral on worrying, so maybe slight consideration? But distrust is strong. Maybe 2.

Wait, his personality: Strongly Agree on making plans and following through. But also Strongly Agree on being careless. Contradiction? Maybe he plans but doesn't execute carefully. So for purchase, he might plan to buy but not follow through? But the ad isn't convincing him.

Also, as a blue-collar worker with low income, he might prioritize practicality. The ad says "stay energized," which could appeal to a worker needing energy, but he's distrustful. However, he's anxious and gets nervous easily—maybe energy drinks could worsen anxiety? So he might avoid it.

But the ad says "look your best," which might not resonate with someone who has few artistic interests and isn't focused on appearance.

His outgoing trait might make him care about social image, but he's not helpful/unselfish, so maybe he does care about looking good for himself. But with low trust, he doubts the claim.

Putting it all together:
Ad attitude scores: low across the board because of distrust and anxiety. Purchase intention even lower because of skepticism and income constraint.

Scores:
Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=3 (since imaginative, but still low), good=2, attractive=2
Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (slight consideration but unlikely)

Wait, the scale is 1-7, with 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. So for "I like the ad," if he dislikes it, score 1 or 2.

He Strongly Disagrees on being helpful, Disagrees on trusting. So very distrustful. The ad is probably seen as manipulative.

Also, he's careless (Strongly Agree), so might not pay much attention to the ad, leading to low scores.

Emotionally unstable (Disagree on stable), so negative reaction.

So:
ad_attitude_scores: all low. Like=1, interesting=2 (since imaginative, maybe a tiny bit), good=1, attractive=1

Purchase: all very low. Intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (maybe a flicker of thought but no real intent)

But he's outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), so maybe the "look your best" could appeal to social image? But he's distrustful, so probably not.

Also, as a young married man, maybe he cares about providing, but the ad doesn't address that.

I think scores should be mostly 1s and 2s.
