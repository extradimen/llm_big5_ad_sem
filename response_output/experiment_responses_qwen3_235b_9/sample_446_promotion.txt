Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male blue-collar worker over 60. First, I need to really absorb his demographic and personality traits. He's a bachelor with a monthly income of 36-45 million VND, which is actually quite high for Vietnam—maybe he's in a specialized trade or has savings. But he's a blue-collar worker, so probably values practicality. 

His personality is interesting: talks a lot (Agree) but is strongly disagree on outgoing/sociable, and agrees on being reserved. Hmm, so he might chat with people he knows but isn't naturally social. He's strongly agree on being helpful/unselfish but also strongly agree on sometimes being rude? That's contradictory—maybe he's blunt with good intentions. Nervous easily (strongly agree) and worries a lot (agree), so anxiety is high. Emotionally stable is neutral—makes sense with the worry. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved, anxious older worker, he'd probably be skeptical. Blue-collar jobs are physically taxing, so "energized" might resonate, but "look your best" feels superficial for his age group. He's not into artistic/original ideas (strongly disagree), so flashy ads won't impress him. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like the ad? He's blunt and untrusting (Neutral on trusting), so probably dislikes vague claims. Score low. 
- Interesting? He has active imagination (strongly agree) but the ad is generic—might not spark his interest. Medium-low. 
- Good ad? He does thorough job? Disagree, but he follows plans (strongly agree). Still, the ad lacks substance for him. Low score. 
- Attractive? Reserved, not artistic—won't care about aesthetics. Low. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? He's skeptical (nervous/worrier), and the ad feels irrelevant. Very low. 
- Try to buy? Maybe if it were cheaper/more proven, but no evidence here. Still low. 
- Consider? He's practical (follows plans) but "look your best" is off-target for a 60+ blue-collar worker. Slight chance if "energized" addressed real fatigue, but ad doesn't specify how. Maybe a 2 or 3? But given his rudeness trait (strongly agree), he'd dismiss it quickly. 

Wait—his high income might make him less price-sensitive, but the ad's vagueness clashes with his thoroughness (he Disagrees on doing thorough job? Wait no: "I do a thorough job" is Disagree, meaning he *doesn't* do thorough jobs. But he "makes plans and follows through" (strongly agree). Contradiction? Maybe he plans but cuts corners. Still, the ad gives zero details to evaluate, so he'd distrust it. 

Also, "look your best" for a single 60+ man? Might feel it's for younger people. His "sometimes rude" trait could make him scoff at it. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low-mid (2-3) because he's critical. Purchase intention very low (1-2), except "consider" might be 2 since he's practical but the ad fails to convince.
