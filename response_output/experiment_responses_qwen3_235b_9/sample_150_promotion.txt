Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male civil servant in his 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree. His demographic shows he's educated but has modest income (<15M VND/month), divorced, working in government. The personality traits are crucial here - he's reserved (disagrees with being talkative), socially agreeable but not overly outgoing, highly unselfish (strongly agrees), distrustful (strongly disagrees on trusting), occasionally rude, emotionally stable, creative but not careless with work. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims - government work makes him value evidence. His "strongly disagree" on trusting means he'll immediately question this. Also, his modest income makes expensive "energy" drinks seem impractical when tea or coffee would suffice. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He dislikes manipulative ads. His distrust and occasional rudeness mean he'll see this as shallow marketing.
- Interesting (2): Only slightly - his active imagination might ponder the concept, but it's too generic.
- Good (1): "Good" implies credibility he doesn't see. His thorough job trait (neutral) means he'd want proof.
- Attractive (1): No visual described, and his artistic interests (strongly disagrees) mean he won't care about aesthetics.

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Zero. He's financially cautious and distrustful.
- Try (1): Why waste money on unproven claims? His "careless" trait (agrees) ironically makes him avoid frivolous buys.
- Consider (2): Maybe if there's data, but the ad provides none. His originality (agrees) means he'd prefer researching alternatives.

Noting his emotional stability (strongly agree) - he won't be swayed by "look your best" vanity. And as a helpful person, he might actually warn others about such ads! The divorce status suggests life experience that increases skepticism toward superficial promises.

This ad fails on every level for him: no credibility, irrelevant to his pragmatic lifestyle, and clashes with his distrustful nature. Maximum score of 2 only because he might neutrally acknowledge the concept exists.
