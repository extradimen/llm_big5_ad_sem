Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not very talkative or sociable (Disagree/Neutral on outgoing traits), strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish, and strongly disagree with being careless. But I do agree with making plans and get nervous easily, while strongly disagreeing with worrying a lot and having emotional stability. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's not particularly trusting (Neutral) and strongly disagrees with being unselfish, I'd be skeptical. The ad feels too vague - no specifics on how it works or proof. Since I'm thorough (Neutral) but get nervous easily (Agree), I'd want concrete evidence, not just fluffy claims. 

Also, I strongly disagree with having an active imagination or artistic interests, so emotional appeals won't work on me. The "look your best" part might even annoy me since I'm not into superficial stuff (few artistic interests = Neutral). 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not (low score) because it feels manipulative. 
- Interesting? Maybe slightly since I'm practical (Neutral on thoroughness), but still vague. 
- Good? No, lacks credibility. 
- Attractive? Not at all - I'm reserved and not swayed by aesthetics. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. 
- Will try? Unlikely without proof. 
- Consider? Maybe if there were details, but as is? No. 

My scores should reflect strong skepticism. I'm practical but nervous, so vague claims make me distrustful. And since I'm not helpful/unselfish, I won't fall for "look your best" vanity appeals. Gotta be brutally honest here - this ad misses the mark completely for me.
