Okay, let me approach this as a Chinese woman in her 40s with the given profile. First, I need to internalize her demographic and personality traits. She's single, highly educated (postgraduate), earns 36-45 million VND monthly—that's upper-middle class in China. Her personality shows she's reserved (Agree), not talkative or sociable (Disagree on both), and interestingly, she Strongly Agrees she's careless but also Strongly Agrees she worries a lot. Contradictory? Maybe her carelessness is practical (like messy desk) while anxiety is emotional. She Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish, which suggests self-prioritization—common for high-earning professionals who've navigated competitive fields alone. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who Strongly Agrees she "worries a lot" but Disagrees on being "emotionally stable" (Neutral), she'd scrutinize vague claims. "Look your best" feels superficial—she Strongly Agrees she has "few artistic interests," so beauty-focused messaging might annoy her. Her "carelessness" trait (Strongly Agree) clashes with the ad's promise of daily perfection; she knows she skips routines. Also, her "reserved" nature means she'd distrust overly cheerful ads targeting extroverts. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like (Q1): She'd find it generic. Reserved people dislike pushy ads. Score 2. 
- Interesting (Q2): "Stay energized" is boring to her—she's a planner (Strongly Agrees) who manages energy via schedules, not drinks. Neutral 4 feels too high; she'd think "another caffeine gimmick." Score 3. 
- Good (Q3): "Good" implies credibility. With her worrying tendency, she'd question evidence. "Helps" is weasel wording. Score 2. 
- Attractive (Q4): Visuals? Not specified, but her artistic disinterest (Strongly Agree) means aesthetics won't sway her. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (Q1): Zero. She Disagrees on being "helpful/unselfish," so she won't buy things for social validation. Energy? She manages it via planning (Strongly Agrees). Score 1. 
- Try (Q2): Maybe if free sample, but she's careless—might forget to try it. Still, unlikely. Score 2. 
- Consider (Q3): Only if ad cited clinical studies, but it doesn't. Her worry trait makes her skeptical. Score 2. 

Wait—her income is high, but the ad's vagueness overrides that. She'd prefer a nootropic with peer-reviewed data, not a "drink." Also, as a single professional, she's time-poor; daily drink routines seem like extra hassle. Final scores reflect her critical, anxiety-driven pragmatism.
