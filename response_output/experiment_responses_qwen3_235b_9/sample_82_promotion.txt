Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 40-49 year old Chinese male with specific traits: postgraduate degree but blue-collar job, divorced, 16-25M VND monthly income. Key personality points stand out - he's strongly disagree on talkative but agrees on sociable (interesting contradiction), strongly disagrees on trusting, strongly agrees on being sometimes rude and worrying a lot. Also strongly disagrees on emotional stability but strongly agrees on making plans. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker with physical job demands, the "energized" part might resonate, but his high worry/anxiety traits make me think he'd be skeptical. His strong distrust (strongly disagree on trusting) means he'll immediately question this claim. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He's not very open (strongly disagree on talkative), and the ad feels superficial. Probably low score. 
- Interesting: With few artistic interests and disagree on imagination, he won't find creative ads engaging. But "energized" might catch his attention briefly? Maybe neutral-low.
- Good: His thoroughness is neutral, but distrust is high. He'll think it's manipulative. Low.
- Attractive: Agrees on few artistic interests, so visual appeal won't sway him. Strongly agree on worrying means he'll focus on hidden costs/risks. Very low.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Strongly agree on carelessness but also strong planner. However distrust dominates. Zero chance.
- Try: Might consider if cheap sample, but ad gives no concrete info. Unlikely.
- Consider: Only if he sees evidence, but ad provides none. His worry trait makes him overanalyze risks.

Wait - his income is 16-25M VND (~$650-1000). For Vietnam, that's decent but not lavish. Energy drinks are cheap, but he'd still be cautious with spending (divorced, possible child support). 

Biggest red flags: 
- "Look your best" feels vain for a blue-collar worker who agrees on few artistic interests. 
- No proof of claims triggers his strong worry trait. 
- His rudeness tendency means he'd dismiss it as "another scam ad."

Final scoring logic:
Ad attitude all low (1-3 range). Purchase intention near-zero except maybe "consider" at 2 since he's a planner who might theoretically research further - but ad gives no reason to. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Strongly agree on worrying → amplifies skepticism 
- Strongly disagree on emotional stability → prone to negative reactions 
- Agree on helpfulness but disagree on trusting → won't buy but might warn others about it

Yep, scores should reflect deep skepticism bordering on hostility toward the ad's vagueness.
