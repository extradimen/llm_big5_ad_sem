Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female office worker with high school education, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm extremely talkative and sociable (Strongly Agree to both), not reserved (Disagree), but interestingly Disagree with being helpful/unselfish. I Agree I'm generally trusting but Neutral about sometimes being rude. I Agree I do thorough work but Strongly Disagree about following through plans - that's important. I worry a lot (Agree) but don't get nervous easily (Disagree). For creativity, I Agree about active imagination and new ideas, and Strongly Disagree about having few artistic interests.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a sociable office worker who worries a lot but isn't emotionally stable (Neutral), I'd probably be skeptical. My Strongly Disagree on "make plans and follow through" suggests I'm impulsive, so vague promises might not convince me. Since I'm creative (Agree on imagination/ideas) and artistic (Strongly Disagree on few interests), I'd want more concrete info or stylish presentation.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: Probably low. I'm critical (encouraged to be honest) and the ad feels generic. My "worry a lot" trait makes me distrust vague claims. Maybe 2.
- Interesting: Neutral at best. As someone who makes new ideas (Agree), this lacks creativity. But "look your best" might catch my eye as an artistic person. Maybe 3.
- Good: Disagree strongly. My thorough job trait (Agree) means I'd want evidence. The ad gives none. Score 2.
- Attractive: Slightly higher since I have artistic interests (Strongly Disagree on few), but still generic. Maybe 3.

For purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: Absolutely not. My Strongly Disagree on following through plans shows I'm not commitment-prone, and I distrust ads. Score 1.
- Will try to buy: Unlikely. I'm unselfish? No - I Disagree with being helpful/unselfish, but that doesn't translate to buying random products. Still skeptical. Score 2.
- Will consider: Maybe if there's more info, but this ad gives nothing. My worrying nature (Agree) makes me hesitant. Score 2.

Double-checking traits: My sociability (Strongly Agree) might make me share ads, but this one's too bland. My trust (Agree) is conditional - no proof here. And "look your best" might appeal to my artistic side but feels shallow. Final scores should reflect skepticism from my thorough-but-unplanned approach to life.
