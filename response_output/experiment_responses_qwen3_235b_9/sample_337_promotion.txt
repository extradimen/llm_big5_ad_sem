Okay, let me approach this systematically as the specified persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male student with bachelor's degree, living with parents and earning 16-25M VND monthly. His personality shows strong talkativeness but neutral sociability, high originality but low artistic interest, and notably strong agreement with worrying yet emotional stability - that's an interesting contradiction to unpack.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone in his demographic:
- As a mature student, he might value energy but question "look your best" claims
- His strong originality (SA) suggests he'd scrutinize vague promises
- High worry tendency (SA) makes him skeptical of unproven benefits
- Emotional stability (SA) means skepticism won't cause anxiety
- Low thoroughness (Disagree) implies he won't research claims

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like: He's talkative but not easily impressed. "Look your best" feels shallow for his age. Score 3 - slightly disagree
2. Interesting: His originality might appreciate the concept but "helps you" is too generic. Neutral 4
3. Good: Disagree with thoroughness means he spots flaws - no evidence provided. Strong disagree 2
4. Attractive: Strongly artistic disinterest makes visuals irrelevant. Disagree 2

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Worry tendency + skepticism = no way. Strong disagree 1
2. Try: Might humorously sample if free, but won't seek it. Slight disagree 3
3. Consider: Originality could make him ponder alternatives. Neutral 4

Noting key contradictions: 
- Emotional stability prevents worry from paralyzing him, but fuels skepticism
- Being a student at 50+ suggests non-traditional path - he values substance over hype
- High income for student status implies practical spending habits

The ad fails because:
- "Look your best" targets younger demographics
- No specifics on how it works (triggers his worry tendency)
- Conflicts with his unselfish/helpful nature - self-improvement ads feel selfish

Final scores reflect: 
- Mild curiosity (4) but strong rejection of credibility (2,1)
- Consideration only as intellectual exercise (4), not real intent
- Total mismatch with his life stage as mature student living with parents
