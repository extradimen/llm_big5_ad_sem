Okay, let me approach this as the 50-59 year old Chinese civil servant with the specified traits. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my personality: I'm reserved (Agree), worry a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), and not original (Strongly Disagree). As a civil servant with postgraduate education, I'd be analytical and skeptical of vague health claims. The ad's phrasing feels too generic - "stay energized and look your best" lacks scientific backing. My tendency to worry (Strongly Agree) makes me question if this is another overhyped product. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. The ad feels superficial for someone who values thoroughness (Agree). 
- Interesting (2): Disagree. My low openness to new ideas (Strongly Disagree on originality) means I'd find it unremarkable. 
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. As a detail-oriented person (Agree on thorough job), I'd see it as poorly substantiated. 
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. My reserved nature (Agree) makes flashy ads unappealing.

For purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. My careful planning (Agree on following through) means I'd research proper alternatives. 
- Try (2): Unlikely. My distrust of careless claims (Strongly Disagree on carelessness) overrides any curiosity. 
- Consider (3): Maybe minimally, but only because I'm generally trusting (Strongly Agree) - though my worry habit (Strongly Agree) would quickly kill this.

The income range (26-35M VND) is solid but not extravagant for a senior civil servant, so I wouldn't impulsively buy unproven products. The ad's failure to provide evidence clashes with my professional standards.
