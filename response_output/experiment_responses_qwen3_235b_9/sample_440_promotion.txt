Alright, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the virtual person described. The demographic profile says Chinese male over 60, high school education, managerial employee, divorced, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. Personality traits are a mix: he's outgoing but also strongly reserved, not helpful or unselfish, sometimes rude, thorough at work, not a planner, not careless, emotionally unstable, imaginative but not original, and has strong artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone over 60, he might be skeptical about energy drinks. His income is decent, but he's not into being unselfish or trusting blindly. He's emotionally unstable and imaginative, so maybe he's critical of vague claims. 

For ad attitude: 
1. "I like the ad." He's reserved and sometimes rude, probably doesn't like flashy ads. Plus, he's not trusting of such claims. Score low, maybe 2.
2. "Interesting?" His active imagination might find it boring since it's generic. He disagrees on being original, so likely not interesting. Score 2.
3. "Believe it's good?" He's thorough but emotionally unstable. Vague promises might annoy him. Strongly disagree with being unselfish, so he might see it as manipulative. Score 1.
4. "Attractive?" He has artistic interests but the ad is probably plain. His rudeness and distrust lower appeal. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase?" He's not trusting, thorough, and emotionally unstable. He'd doubt the claims. No intention. Score 1.
2. "Will try to buy?" His traits show he doesn't follow plans and is careless? Wait, no—he strongly disagrees with being careless. But he doesn't make plans. Still, he's skeptical. Unlikely to try. Score 1.
3. "Will consider?" Maybe slightly, but given his strong disagreement on trust and helpfulness, probably not. But "consider" might be a tiny bit higher. Still, score 1.

Wait, his income is high, but the ad's claim might not resonate with his age. Energy drinks are often for younger people. At 60+, he might prefer health-focused products, not "look your best." Also, his artistic interests might make him value authenticity, which this ad lacks. 

Double-check personality: Strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so he's self-focused. But the ad's benefit is personal ("you"), which might align, but he's distrustful. He worries a lot (neutral), but emotionally unstable (strongly disagree), meaning he's unstable—so anxious about false claims. 

Yes, all scores should be very low. Ad attitude scores 1-2, purchase intention all 1s.
