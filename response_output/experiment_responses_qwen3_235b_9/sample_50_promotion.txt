Okay, let me step into this persona carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese woman studying with high school education and low income (<15M VND/month). My personality traits are very specific: strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish but strongly disagree with trusting others, strongly agree with being nervous but strongly disagree with worrying... interesting contradictions there. 

Hmm the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a student on tight budget, I'd immediately question how "look your best" connects to a drink. My strong emotional stability (12th trait) makes me skeptical of vague beauty claims, but my nervousness (10th trait) makes me crave energy solutions. 

*Checks income again* - under 15M VND is barely 60 USD, so premium energy drinks are out of reach. My "do a thorough job" disagreement means I won't research claims, but "make plans and follow through" agreement suggests I'd stick to cheap coffee if I tried alternatives. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Neutral at best (4) - too flashy for my reserved-but-not-rude nature
- Interesting? Maybe 3 - "look your best" feels irrelevant to my divorced student life
- Good? 2 - misleading when I know real energy comes from sleep I can't afford
- Attractive? 3 - but "attractive" feels superficial for my "few artistic interests" trait

Purchase intention? 
- Intend? 1 - my trust issues scream "scam!"
- Try? 2 - only if dirt cheap sample
- Consider? 3 - but my "careless" disagreement means I'd forget by tomorrow

*Pauses* Wait - my "strongly agree" with being helpful makes me think: would I buy this to share with classmates? But no, my income and distrust override that. Final scores feel harsh but honest for this persona.
