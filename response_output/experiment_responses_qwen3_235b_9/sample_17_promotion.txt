Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this Chinese male civil servant in his 30s with a postgraduate degree. Let me first internalize his profile and personality traits.

Hmm, he's married, makes under 15 million VND monthly (which is actually quite low for a civil servant with his education—maybe this is intentional to test socioeconomic awareness?), and has some interesting contradictions in his personality. He strongly agrees he's talkative but also strongly agrees he's reserved? That's unusual—maybe he talks a lot in specific contexts but is generally quiet? He strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable but strongly agrees with being trusting... interesting mix. Also strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish but agrees he's sometimes rude? And he worries a lot while having an active imagination but disagrees on being original. 

Okay, the ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic health/beauty claim with zero specifics. 

Now, as this civil servant: 
- His job requires thoroughness (strongly agrees) so he'd spot the vagueness immediately. 
- He worries a lot (strongly agrees) so he'd question the claims—no evidence, no ingredients listed. 
- He's emotionally unstable (disagrees with being stable) so generic "look your best" might trigger insecurity rather than appeal. 
- Low income but postgraduate degree—he's educated enough to see through fluff but might be budget-conscious. 
- Strongly disagrees he's helpful/unselfish—so he won't buy into "this is good for society" angles. 

Ad attitude: 
1. Like? Nah. Too shallow for someone who does thorough work. He'd hate the lack of substance. → 2 
2. Interesting? Maybe the vagueness makes it ironically intriguing? But no—he worries a lot, so he'd distrust it. → 3 
3. Good? As a civil servant valuing thoroughness? Absolutely not. → 1 
4. Attractive? The claim feels cheap, not aspirational for a reserved person who isn't sociable. → 2 

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend to buy? With his income level and distrust of vague claims? Never. → 1 
2. Try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity? But he's not careless (neutral) and worries a lot—risk-averse. → 1 
3. Consider buying? Only if he saw proof, but the ad gives none. His thoroughness demands evidence. → 2 

...Wait, should "consider" be higher? No—he's skeptical by nature (disagrees with being emotionally stable, worries a lot). He'd dismiss it instantly. But "consider" implies minimal openness, so 2 feels right—barely a flicker of thought before rejecting it.
