Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese female in my 30s-40s, divorced, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My income is 26-35 million VND monthly—wait, that seems high for blue-collar in Vietnam? But I'll go with the profile. 

Hmm, personality traits are key here. I'm reserved (strongly agree), not outgoing (strongly disagree), worry a lot (strongly agree), but emotionally stable? Neutral. Interesting mix. I do thorough work (strongly agree), have active imagination (strongly agree), but disagree on being original or careless. And I'm not trusting (strongly disagree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward ad: 
- Like? As a reserved, worrisome person, I'd find this too generic. No specifics—how does it energize? "Look your best" feels superficial. I strongly disagree with trusting claims easily, so probably low score. Maybe 2.
- Interesting? My active imagination might engage, but "look your best" clashes with my blue-collar reality. I'm not into superficial beauty. Neutral? But I have few artistic interests? Wait no—strongly disagree means I DO have artistic interests. Still, ad feels shallow. Score 3.
- Good? Thorough worker me would want evidence. "Helps" is vague. No data, no credibility. Strongly disagree with careless tendencies, so I'd critique this hard. Score 2.
- Attractive? Reserved + not sociable = not drawn to flashy ads. "Look your best" might even feel manipulative for divorced working mom. Score 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Zero. I worry about health claims, distrust ads. Strongly disagree with trusting. Score 1.
- Try? Maybe if cheap/free sample, but "look your best" isn't my priority. Blue-collar work = practical energy needs (like coffee), not beauty. Still low. Score 2.
- Consider? Only if ad provided proof (e.g., "studies show..."), but it doesn't. My thorough nature rejects empty claims. Score 2.

Wait—marital status divorced + blue-collar with high income? Might imply resilience, but ad's "look your best" feels irrelevant to daily work struggles. Also, Vietnamese context: 26-35m VND/month is actually high (avg blue-collar is ~8m), so maybe she's skilled labor? But ad still misses mark. 

Final scores: Ad attitude low across board, purchase intention near-zero. Must reflect her skepticism and practicality.
