Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese civil servant with very particular traits, and evaluate an energy drink ad based on that persona. 

First, I need to internalize this character profile: 20s-30s male, postgrad civil servant in Vietnam earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Key traits stand out immediately - he's socially contradictory (agrees with "outgoing" but also "reserved"), strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish, and has high neuroticism ("nervous easily" strongly agree but "worry a lot" strongly disagree? That's interesting - maybe situational anxiety). Crucially, he's artistically uninterested but imaginative, which feels paradoxical.

Hmm... the ad says "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant: 
- "Energized" might appeal to bureaucratic workload, but his "do a thorough job: disagree" suggests he wouldn't prioritize productivity boosts. 
- "Look your best" is tricky - he's married, not career-focused on appearance (artistic interests strongly disagree), and his "sometimes rude: agree" implies low vanity. 

Biggest red flags: 
His "generally trusting: disagree" and "emotionally unstable: strongly disagree" mean he'll scrutinize claims. No evidence in ad = instant skepticism. 
"Helpful/unselfish: strongly disagree" translates to "why should I believe this benefits ME?" 
"Careless: neutral" but "make plans: agree" - he'd dismiss vague promises without concrete mechanisms.

Purchase intention? Near-zero. Civil servants have stable routines; energy drinks feel frivolous for his income bracket. Plus "I have few artistic interests: strongly agree" suggests utilitarian mindset - he'd want proven functional benefits, not "look your best" fluff.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because:
- "Like/ad": rude, untrusting person hates salesy tone
- "Interesting/good/attractive": non-artistic, unimaginative (wait no - "active imagination: strongly agree" but "original ideas: strongly disagree"? Ah, he fantasizes but doesn't innovate. Still, ad's shallow claim won't spark his imagination)

Purchase: All 1s. 
- "Intend/try": Strongly disagree with helpfulness = zero altruistic buying 
- "Consider": But "trusting: disagree" + no proof = won't even entertain it

Wait - should "consider" be 2? No. His "worry a lot: strongly disagree" means he's decisive about dismissing unproven claims. Better stick with 1s.
