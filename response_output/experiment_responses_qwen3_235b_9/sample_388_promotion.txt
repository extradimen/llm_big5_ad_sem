Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I need to embody this 30-39-year-old Chinese female student with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are key here: she's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Disagree), neutral on sociability, strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees on trusting, strongly disagrees with being rude, strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs, agrees with making plans but also agrees with being careless, disagrees with getting nervous, neutral on worrying, strongly disagrees with emotional stability, neutral on imagination, disagrees on originality, and strongly agrees with having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved person who's not into artistic interests and doesn't do thorough jobs, I'd probably see this as superficial. She's strongly trusting but also emotionally unstable - that's an interesting tension. She might initially believe claims but then second-guess due to emotional volatility. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: She's not talkative or sociable, probably indifferent to flashy ads. Strongly disagrees with being unselfish, so "look your best" might feel vain. Score: 2
- Interesting: Neutral on imagination/originality, few artistic interests. Generic energy/beauty claim won't engage her. Score: 3
- Good: She strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs - she'd spot lack of evidence. "Helps you stay energized" is vague. Score: 2
- Attractive: Strongly agrees with few artistic interests. No visual description but phrasing feels cliché to her. Score: 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend: She's careless (Agree) but also makes plans (Agree). However, emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree) - impulsive but distrustful long-term. Zero evidence in ad. Score: 1
- Try: Strongly trusting might make her consider, but careless tendency + low ad credibility. Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad doesn't offer that. Score: 2
- Consider: Neutral on worrying but emotionally unstable. Might briefly think about it when tired, but no concrete details to latch onto. Score: 3

Wait, her income is high (36-45M VND ≈ $1500 USD) but she's a student? That's unusual - probably means family support or scholarships. Still, as a careless student who doesn't do thorough jobs, she wouldn't research this. The ad feels like every other energy drink claim to her. 

Biggest red flag: "look your best" clashes with her non-artistic, unoriginal self-view. She'd think "This is for people who care about appearances, not me." And since she strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, the ad's self-focused message might even annoy her as shallow. 

Final scores make sense: ad feels irrelevant (low 1-3s) and purchase intent is near-zero except maybe "consider" at 3 because of momentary emotional instability (e.g., "maybe when I'm stressed...").
