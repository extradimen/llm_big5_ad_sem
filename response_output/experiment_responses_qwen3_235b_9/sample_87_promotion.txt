Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education, living with parents and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative (Strongly Agree) but also reserved (Agree), which seems contradictory but might mean I'm sociable in familiar settings. I'm not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), not trusting (Disagree), and actually "sometimes rude" (Strongly Agree). I worry a lot (Agree) but am emotionally stable (Neutral). I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree) but am original with ideas (Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims. My "disagree" on trusting and "strongly agree" on being rude suggests I'd dislike pushy marketing. The ad feels too generic - no ingredients, no proof. Since I "worry a lot" but am "emotionally stable," I might dismiss it as unrealistic. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? (1) I'd hate the oversimplification. 
- Interesting? (2) Maybe slightly due to "original ideas" trait, but still low. 
- Good? (1) "Thorough job" Agree but ad lacks substance. 
- Attractive? (1) "Few artistic interests" means I won't care about aesthetics.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? (1) Distrustful by nature. 
- Try? (2) Might humor it once but unlikely. 
- Consider? (3) Only because I'm "original" enough to entertain ideas, but still skeptical.

My monthly income is decent but as a civil servant living with parents, I'm probably frugal. No mention of price makes me wary. Also, "look your best" feels superficial for my age group - we'd prefer concrete health benefits.
