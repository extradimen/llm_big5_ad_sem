Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this Chinese male blue-collar worker in his 20s with a bachelor's degree. His income is high (>46M VND/month), which is unusual for a blue-collar role but we'll go with it. Key personality traits stand out: he's extremely talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing (Agree), but also admits to being sometimes rude (Strongly Agree) and careless (Strongly Agree). He's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and original with new ideas (Strongly Agree), but does a poor job being thorough (Strongly Disagree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He'd probably dislike vague claims. As someone who's "sometimes rude" and "careless," he might call it out as lazy advertising. Score 2.
- Interesting: His "original ideas" trait makes him crave creativity, but this ad is generic. "Few artistic interests" (Strongly Agree) suggests he won't appreciate subtle artistry. Score 3.
- Good: He "makes plans and follows through" (Strongly Agree) so he values substance. This ad lacks proof. Score 2.
- Attractive: "Helps look your best" might appeal to his sociable side, but "rude/careless" traits make him skeptical. Score 3.

For purchase intention:
- Intend: High income but thorough job trait is "Strongly Disagree" – he's impulsive but won't commit without evidence. Score 1.
- Try: His "emotionally stable" and "not nervous" traits mean he won't panic-buy, but "original ideas" might make him experiment. Still, ad feels untrustworthy. Score 2.
- Consider: "Generally trusting" (Agree) but "sometimes rude" suggests cynicism. Might glance at it in-store but no real interest. Score 3.

Noting contradictions: He's helpful/unselfish but also rude – probably blunt with colleagues but loyal to friends. The ad's superficial "look your best" angle feels disconnected from his blue-collar reality where energy matters more than appearance. His high income might make him dismiss "cheap" energy drinks, expecting premium solutions.
