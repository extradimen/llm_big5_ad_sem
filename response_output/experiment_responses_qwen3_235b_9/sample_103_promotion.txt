Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60 with a blue-collar job. His demographic shows he's earning 26-35 million VND monthly—pretty solid for his background—but he lives with parents, which might mean family responsibilities weigh on him. 

First, unpacking his personality traits: He's strongly talkative but also strongly reserved? That's interesting—maybe he speaks thoughtfully when he does talk, not just chatty. Strongly agrees he's emotionally stable (good for handling work stress), strongly disagrees with being outgoing (so not a party guy), and disagrees about nervousness. He makes plans meticulously but does thorough work only "neutral"—hmm, maybe he follows routines without overcomplicating things. Neutral on helpfulness/trust/rudeness suggests he's pragmatic, not overly trusting but not cynical either. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ blue-collar worker, "look your best" feels off—guys his age in manual jobs probably care more about practical energy for work than appearance. "Stay energized" could resonate since physical labor is tiring, but... wait, he's emotionally stable and not anxious, so he might not feel he *needs* energy boosts. Also, his "strongly agree" on making plans suggests he values concrete solutions, not vague promises. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too flashy for him. He's reserved, not into hype. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe a flicker of "huh" but not really. 
- Good (1): Feels insincere—blue-collar folks spot "too good to be true" easily. 
- Attractive (1): Doesn't align with his practical self; "look your best" is irrelevant. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero. He plans meticulously—this ad gives no proof. 
- Try (1): Why risk money on empty claims? 
- Consider (2): *Maybe* if he saw coworkers using it successfully, but standalone? Nah. 

...Also, that income range is suspiciously high for Vietnam (26-35m VND is ~$1,000-$1,400 USD). He'd be frugal—no splurging on unproven drinks. And "look your best"? At 60, with parents to support? Please. He's got real concerns.
