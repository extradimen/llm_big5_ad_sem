Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese female persona - 40s, blue-collar worker with high school education, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's sociable but careless, emotionally unstable yet creative, with mixed trust levels.

Hmm... looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone in physical labor (blue-collar), energy claims might resonate but the "look your best" part feels superficial. Given her monthly income is actually quite high for Vietnam (26-35m VND â‰ˆ $1,100-1,500), but she's careless with money and emotionally unstable - she might impulse buy but not trust vague promises.

*checks personality notes again* 
- Strongly agrees she's careless and emotionally unstable 
- Neutral on trust/worry 
- Strongly agrees she's original/creative
- But disagrees on thoroughness/planning

Ah! This explains why she'd hate the ad's vagueness. As a creative person (strongly agrees), she'd spot the lack of concrete benefits. Her emotional instability (strongly disagrees being stable) makes her skeptical of "every day" promises - life's too unpredictable when you're divorced with blue-collar stress. 

Also... "look your best" feels irrelevant. She's a practical worker - probably cares more about real energy for her job than appearance. Her "few artistic interests" (agrees) means she won't buy into aesthetic claims. And since she's sometimes rude (agrees), she might even roll her eyes at the ad.

For purchase intention: 
- She'll "consider" it (maybe 3/7) because she's impulsive (careless + emotional) 
- But won't "intend" or "try" to buy - too skeptical (neutral on trust) and unthorough (disagrees on planning). 

*adjusting scores* 
Ad attitude should be low across board - 2s and 3s. Only "interesting" might scrape a 3 because she's talkative/sociable (agrees), so she might discuss it with coworkers despite not believing it. But "attractive"? Nah - she agrees she has few artistic interests.

Final scores crystallizing: 
Ad attitude: 2,3,2,2 (like/interesting/good/attractive) 
Purchase: 1,1,3 (intend/try/consider)
