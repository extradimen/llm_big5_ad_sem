Okay, let me step into this persona carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese married woman with managerial job, high school education, and decent income (26-35M VND/month). My personality is... interesting mix - agree I'm talkative/sociable but also reserved? That feels contradictory but maybe means I'm selective about socializing. Strongly disagree with being unselfish (so pragmatic), strongly disagree with rudeness (polite), agree with thoroughness but neutral on planning (spontaneous tendencies?). Oh and crucially: strongly agree I get nervous easily, agree I worry a lot, disagree I'm emotionally stable. But also strongly agree I have active imagination! 

Hmm the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a nervous, worrisome person with active imagination... I'd probably overanalyze this. "Look your best" triggers my insecurity - since I worry about appearance? But also being reserved might make me skeptical of bold claims. 

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: 
  * Like? (1-7) I'm sociable so might enjoy ads generally, but "look your best" feels shallow for a 30s manager. I do thorough work though - this ad seems superficial. Probably neutral-to-negative. 
  * Interesting? My active imagination might engage with it... but "energized and look best" is clich√©. Maybe 3? 
  * Good? As someone who worries, I'd question credibility. No evidence shown. Strong disagree on thoroughness applying to ad quality. 
  * Attractive? Reserved side would dislike flashy claims. But imagination might appreciate visuals... though ad copy is barebones. 

- Purchase intention: 
  * Intend? Absolutely not. I'm nervous about unverified health claims. 
  * Try? Maybe if cheap sample, but my "careless" strong disagree means I research first. 
  * Consider? Only if I saw clinical proof. My thoroughness demands evidence. 

Wait - my income is good but I'm not unselfish (so not impulsive buyer). And "look your best" might appeal to married woman caring about appearance... but my emotional instability makes me distrust such promises. 

Final scoring logic: 
Ad attitude all low (2-3 range) because: 
- "Look your best" feels manipulative to my worrisome nature 
- No substance for my thoroughness trait 
- But imagination prevents total dismissal (so not 1s) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: 1 (strongly disagree) 
- Try: 2 (barely) 
- Consider: 3 (only if more info) 

...Wait the ad_type is fixed as "promotion". Got it.
