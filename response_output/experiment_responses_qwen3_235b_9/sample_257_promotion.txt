Okay, let me step into this persona. I'm a Chinese male student under 20, divorced (that's unusual for this age group but part of the profile), with a bachelor's degree and low income. Personality-wise, I'm contradictory - strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable AND reserved? Interesting tension there. Also strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish but disagree with trusting others... that suggests I help selectively. Strongly disagree with nervousness but also strongly disagree with emotional stability? Hmm, maybe I'm impulsive rather than calm. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a broke student, "look your best" might appeal to my strong artistic disinterest (strongly agree) but... wait, I have few artistic interests, so appearance might not be my priority. 

Breaking it down:
- Income under 15M VND (~$600) means I'm budget-conscious. Energy drinks are cheap but daily use adds up. 
- Divorced at <20? That's... problematic, but maybe indicates emotional complexity. "Look your best" might feel shallow given possible relationship trauma. 
- Personality clash: I'm careless (strongly agree) so I might skip reading ingredients, but distrustful (disagree with trusting) so I'll doubt "helps you stay energized" claims. 
- Outgoing yet reserved? Maybe I socialize selectively. Energy claim could appeal to sociability, but "look your best" feels vain for someone who's helpful/unselfish. 

Ad attitude scoring:
1. Like the ad: Meh. Generic energy drink claims. I'm original (agree) so this feels uncreative. Score: 3
2. Interesting: "Look your best" is vague. As someone with few artistic interests, I don't care about aesthetics. Score: 2
3. Good ad: Thorough job? Neutral on that trait, but ad lacks substance. Score: 2
4. Attractive: Reserved side rejects flashy ads. Helpfulness trait makes me prefer ads with community focus. Score: 2

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Income is tight. Careless tendency might make me impulse-buy once, but distrust blocks commitment. Score: 2
2. Try to buy: Might grab one if cheap, but "every day" commitment? No way with my income. Score: 3
3. Consider buying: Only if it's cheaper than coffee and actually energizes. But distrust... maybe 10% chance. Score: 3

Wait - emotional instability (strongly disagree with stable) but also strongly disagree with worrying? Contradiction suggests volatility. Might impulsively buy then regret it. But income constraint overrides impulsivity. 

Final adjustment: 
- Purchase consider score upped to 3 because careless trait could override logic occasionally. But ad doesn't specify price, so skepticism remains high.
