Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male postgraduate manager described. 

First, analyzing my demographic and personality traits: I'm a 20-29yo Chinese male living with parents, earning under 15M VND/month. My personality shows strong sociability (Strongly Agree outgoing) but also high anxiety (Strongly Agree nervous/worries). Interesting contradictions - I'm talkative yet reserved, creative but careless, emotionally stable yet worry a lot. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone with postgraduate education, I'd immediately question the vagueness. "Helps stay energized" - how? Caffeine? Sugar? No specifics. "Look your best" feels like empty beauty marketing that doesn't resonate with my Strongly Agree "few artistic interests" trait. 

My Strongly Agree "worry a lot" and "nervous easily" traits make me skeptical. Energy drinks often cause jitters - which would worsen my anxiety! The ad ignores potential downsides. Also, as a managerial employee with Strongly Disagree "follow through with plans", I'm probably stressed about deadlines but this ad feels too simplistic for my complex work needs. 

Financially, at <15M VND/month living with parents, I'm budget-conscious. Energy drinks are expensive long-term. My Neutral "helpful to others" means I won't buy it for social reasons, and Strongly Agree "careless" suggests I might forget to drink it daily anyway. 

Cultural angle: Chinese consumers increasingly distrust health claims after milk scandals. My Strongly Agree "trusting" is contradicted by postgraduate critical thinking - I'd demand evidence. The ad feels like typical Western-style hype that doesn't align with Chinese herbal medicine traditions I might prefer. 

For scoring: 
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, triggers skepticism 
- Interesting (2): Only as a case study in bad advertising 
- Good (1): Poorly targeted, lacks substance 
- Attractive (1): Visually probably clichÃ© (gym bros/shiny cans) 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero impulse to buy 
- Try (2): Maybe if free sample, but unlikely 
- Consider (3): Only if peer-reviewed studies prove benefits without anxiety side effects
