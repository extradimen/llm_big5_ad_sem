Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement based on the given demographic profile and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'll recall the user's profile. They're a Chinese male over 60, with a postgraduate degree, currently a student (which is a bit unusual for that age, but okay), divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), not trusting (Disagree), thorough (Agree), plans things (Strongly Agree), but also careless (Strongly Agree), nervous (Agree), emotionally unstable (Disagree), has an active imagination (Agree), not original (Strongly Disagree), and few artistic interests (Agree). 

The task is to score the ad on attitude (4 items) and purchase intention (3 items) using a 7-point scale. The scores must reflect how this specific person would react. 

Starting with ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.** The ad is vague—just says it helps with energy and looking good. As a reserved, thorough person who distrusts others, he'd probably find it superficial. He values substance (postgraduate degree), so "look your best" might seem shallow. His low trust (Disagree on trusting) means he'd question claims without evidence. Also, he's not outgoing—ads targeting sociability wouldn't appeal. Score: low, maybe 2.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** With few artistic interests (Agree) and not original (Strongly Disagree), flashy or creative ads might not engage him. The ad lacks depth—it's a generic claim. His active imagination (Agree) could make him skeptical, imagining flaws. Not interesting. Score: 2.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** "Good" implies effectiveness or credibility. He's thorough (Agree) but careless (Strongly Agree)—contradictory, but overall distrustful. No proof in the ad (e.g., studies, ingredients), so he'd dismiss it as marketing fluff. Emotionally unstable (Disagree), so prone to doubt. Score: 1.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractive = visually/emotionally appealing. Reserved, not sociable (Strongly Disagree), so energetic/"best" imagery might feel pushy. Few artistic interests (Agree) means design won't sway him. Neutral on rudeness but generally unselfish—might see it as selfish to focus on "looking best." Not attractive. Score: 1.

Now purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** High income (26-35M VND is decent in Vietnam), but he's cautious. Distrustful, thorough planner—he'd research first. Ad gives no reason to buy; vague claims. As a student (odd at 60+), maybe budget-conscious despite income. No intention. Score: 1.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Similar reasoning. He plans things (Strongly Agree) but is careless (Strongly Agree)—might forget, but distrust dominates. Unlikely to seek it out. Score: 1.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** "Consider" is softer. But the ad lacks credibility for him. Helpful/unselfish trait—he might prioritize others' needs over "looking best." Nervous (Agree), so health concerns: is this drink safe? No info. Probably no consideration. Score: 2 (slightly higher than 1 because maybe curiosity, but very low).

Double-checking contradictions: 
- Careless (Strongly Agree) vs. thorough (Agree): Thorough might win for big decisions, but distrust is stronger here.
- Active imagination (Agree): Could make him invent reasons to doubt the ad.
- Income is high, but divorced student over 60 might be frugal or skeptical of "miracle" products.

All scores should be critical per instructions. Low scores fit his distrust and reserve. Final scores: ad attitude all low (1-2), purchase intention very low (1-2).
