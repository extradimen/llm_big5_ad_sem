Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. He's a 40-49 year old divorced man with high school education, making under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits are quite a mix - strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable but also reserved? That's interesting. He's strongly agree with worrying a lot but also emotionally stable? Hmm, contradictions here. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with limited income, he'd be skeptical about health claims. His "sometimes rude to others" and "do a thorough job: disagree" traits suggest he might dismiss flashy ads. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - probably low. He's practical, not swayed by vague promises. Maybe 2.
- "Interesting" - neutral? But his "worry a lot" trait makes him distrustful. 3.
- "Good" - his "rude" tendency might make him critical. 2.
- "Attractive" - with "few artistic interests", visuals won't impress him. 1.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" - no way. He's financially cautious. 1.
- "Will try" - maybe if cheap, but ad doesn't specify price. His "careless: neutral" suggests some openness? But still... 2.
- "Will consider" - slightly higher since he's "original, new ideas: strongly agree". Might think about it skeptically. 3.

Wait, his "emotionally stable: strongly agree" contradicts "worry a lot: strongly agree"? Maybe he acknowledges worrying but manages it well. Still, the ad feels too generic for his practical civil servant mindset. 

His "helpful: neutral" means he won't buy for others. "Make plans: agree" but this ad offers no concrete plan. Definitely not resonating with his personality. 

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism mixed with slight openness to new ideas (but not enough to trust this ad). Income constraint is crucial - he'd prioritize necessities over energy drinks.
