Okay, let me step into this persona. A 20-29 year old divorced Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's extremely anxious (strongly agrees with nervousness/worrying) but paradoxically claims emotional stability? Wait no - the traits say "I am emotionally stable: Strongly Agree" but also "I get nervous easily: Strongly Agree" and "I worry a lot: Strongly Agree". That's contradictory... unless he's being sarcastic or has poor self-awareness. Hmm, important nuance.

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic vague health/wellness claim. Given his traits: 
- He's not sociable (strongly disagrees with talkative/outgoing) so probably dislikes flashy ads 
- Tends to be careless (agrees) but also worries a lot (strongly agrees) → might distrust bold promises 
- Neutral on thoroughness/planning → won't research claims deeply 
- Disagrees with being rude but neutral on helpfulness → pragmatic but not gullible 

For ad attitude: 
1. "I like the ad" → 1. Too generic, triggers his anxiety about false claims. Divorced young man likely cynical about "look your best" promises. 
2. "Interesting" → 2. Zero novelty; his "few artistic interests" (agrees) means no aesthetic appeal. 
3. "Believe it's good" → 1. "Good" implies effectiveness - he'll distrust this given high anxiety + low trust ("generally trusting: disagree"). 
4. "Attractive" → 1. Visuals don't matter to him (artistic interests: agree), and anxiety makes him reject superficiality. 

Purchase intention: 
1. "Intend to purchase" → 1. His worry tendency + carelessness combo: too anxious to commit, too careless to follow through. 
2. "Will try" → 2. Might impulsively buy once (carelessness) but anxiety prevents active effort. 
3. "Will consider" → 3. Only 3 because he worries so much - he'll overthink it but never act. 

Critical angle: As a high-anxiety person, he'd fixate on "what if it doesn't work?" or "is this a scam?". The ad's vagueness triggers his worries. Also, divorced status might make him skeptical of "look your best" implying social validation he's lost. Income is decent but not lavish - won't waste money on unproven claims.
