Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic profile: I'm a 30-39yo Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education, married, earning 36-45M VND monthly. My personality shows contradictions - agree with being outgoing/sociable yet also reserved, strongly disagree with being talkative or trusting, neutral on thoroughness but strongly agree with planning. Not helpful/unselfish, emotionally unstable despite disagreeing on worry/nervousness. Artistic interests are limited but imaginative.

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a skeptical office worker who strongly distrusts generalizations (Strongly Disagree on trusting), I'd immediately question the vague "helps" and "look your best" claims. My reserved nature makes me dislike unsolicited health promises, and limited artistic interests mean I won't be swayed by aesthetic appeals.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic to resonate with my planning-oriented, skeptical self. 
- Interesting (2): Only mildly due to active imagination, but no substance.
- Good (1): Violates my "do thorough job" value - zero evidence provided.
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" feels superficial for someone who agrees having few artistic interests.

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Strongly disagree with unselfishness means I prioritize practical value - this offers none.
- Try (1): "Tend to be careless" is strongly disagreed, so I won't impulsively try unverified products.
- Consider (2): Might minimally entertain it as daily energy could help office work, but "look your best" undermines credibility.

Noting key conflicts: 
- My Strongly Agree on planning requires concrete benefits, which the ad lacks
- Emotional instability (Strongly Disagree on being stable) makes me reject "feel-good" claims
- Reserved nature clashes with the ad's presumptuous "look your best" assumption

Final scores reflect deep skepticism - the ad feels like empty marketing that ignores my need for substance. Even the energy claim is too vague for someone who "makes plans and follows through."
