Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific demographic and personality profile to embody - a Chinese male civil servant in his 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits show interesting contradictions: strongly disagree with being reserved but disagree with being talkative, strongly agree with trusting others yet agree with sometimes being rude, and strong creativity but low conscientiousness.

Hmm, looking at the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - it's quite generic. As a civil servant with this personality profile, I need to consider how he'd react. His strong imagination and originality (both strongly agree) would make him skeptical of vague claims. The "look your best" part might even annoy him since he's emotionally stable (agrees) and doesn't worry about appearance much (agrees he has few artistic interests).

His disagree on "do a thorough job" suggests he'd spot the ad's lack of substance immediately. And since he's neutral on being outgoing but strongly disagrees with being reserved, he's probably socially aware enough to recognize manipulative marketing. The income level (36-45m VND is actually quite high in Vietnam) means he's not desperate for energy drinks, but his divorced status might make him cynical about "look your best" promises.

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like: 2 (too generic for his creative mind)
- Interesting: 3 (might briefly catch eye but no substance)
- Good: 2 (poor execution for educated civil servant)
- Attractive: 2 (aesthetics don't compensate for emptiness)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 (no way with such vague claims)
- Try: 2 (maybe if pressured but unlikely)
- Consider: 3 (only if he needs caffeine, but not because of ad)

The key is his strong creativity and distrust of superficial claims - he'd want scientific evidence or unique angles, not this bland promise. His civil service job probably makes him value concrete information over hype. And since he's emotionally stable, "look your best" feels irrelevant to his self-image.
