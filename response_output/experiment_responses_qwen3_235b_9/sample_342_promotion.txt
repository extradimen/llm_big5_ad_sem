Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific demographic: a Chinese woman in her 30s-40s, married, blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality traits include being neutral on talkativeness, strongly disagreeing with being outgoing/sociable, disagreeing with being reserved, agreeing with being helpful but also agreeing with sometimes being rude. She disagrees with doing thorough jobs and following plans, but disagrees with being careless. She strongly disagrees with getting nervous easily but strongly agrees with worrying a lot, agrees with emotional stability, disagrees with active imagination but agrees with being original and having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I need to evaluate her attitude toward the ad and purchase intention on a 7-point scale. Let's break it down.

For ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: She's not very sociable (strongly disagrees with outgoing), so flashy or social-focused ads might not appeal. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it energizes or what "look your best" means. As someone who worries a lot (strongly agree) but is emotionally stable (agrees), she might find it too generic and not credible. She's original (agrees) but has few artistic interests (agrees), so maybe she dislikes fluffy claims. Probably low score, like 2.
2. Interesting: The ad lacks details. She disagrees with active imagination, so she might not engage with abstract promises. As a blue-collar worker, she might prefer practical info. Not interesting, so 2.
3. Good ad: "Good" implies effectiveness. Since she's skeptical (strongly disagrees with trusting others), she'd doubt the claim. She's original but practical—vague ads aren't convincing. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Visually? The text doesn't describe visuals, but her traits (few artistic interests, not imaginative) suggest she won't find it aesthetically appealing. Also, "look your best" might feel superficial to her (agrees with being rude sometimes, so maybe dismissive). Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: She worries a lot but is emotionally stable. However, the ad offers no proof—just a claim. As a practical blue-collar worker with moderate income, she'd be cautious. Strongly disagrees with trusting, so unlikely to buy based on this. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Similar reasons. No specifics on ingredients, cost, or where to buy. She doesn't follow through on plans (disagrees), so even if tempted, she might not act. Score 1.
3. Will consider buying: Maybe if there's more info, but the ad alone? She's original (agrees with new ideas) but skeptical. Still, without credibility, probably not. But "consider" is softer—maybe 2? Wait, she strongly disagrees with trusting, so even consideration is low. Score 1.

Wait, let's double-check. She agrees with being helpful/unselfish, but the ad is self-focused ("look your best"), which might not resonate. Also, her income is decent but blue-collar—she might prioritize family needs over personal drinks. The ad feels irrelevant to her daily work life. 

Purchase intention scores should be very low. Even "consider" might be a 1 because the ad provides zero reasons to believe it. She worries a lot but that makes her more cautious, not more likely to buy. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all 2s (slightly negative but not hating it), purchase intention all 1s (no intention at all).
