Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. I'm a Chinese female office worker in her 20s-30s, divorced, with a postgraduate degree but modest income under 15 million VND monthly. My personality profile shows interesting contradictions: I'm sociable yet strongly reserved, trusting but emotionally unstable, careless yet worried a lot. 

Hmm... looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's emotionally unstable (strongly disagreeing with being emotionally stable) and prone to worrying, I'd be skeptical about such broad claims. The vagueness of "look your best" feels especially unconvincing - what does that even mean? As a careless person (strongly agree), I probably wouldn't bother researching if it's legit.

*checks personality traits again* 
I'm trusting (strongly agree) but also worry a lot (agree). That tension means I might initially believe it but then spiral into doubts. Since I have few artistic interests (neutral) and no active imagination (strongly disagree), flashy ads don't wow me. And with my low income... *sigh*... 15 million VND is tight for a postgrad office worker in China. I'd wonder if this "miracle drink" is overpriced.

For the attitude scores:
- Like? Nah, too generic. Maybe a 3.
- Interesting? Not really - it's the same old energy+beauty pitch. 2.
- Good? Feels manipulative with no proof. 2.
- Attractive? Visually maybe okay but substance is lacking. 3.

Purchase intention? 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not with my financial situation. 1.
- Will try? Maybe if it's cheap sample, but no. 1.
- Consider? Only if there's concrete evidence later. 2 at best.

*adjusts glasses* Wait - as a reserved person (strongly agree), I hate being sold to. And "look your best" feels like it's targeting insecurities... which hits hard since I'm divorced. But I'm not emotionally stable, so this ad might actually stress me out more! Yeah, low scores make sense.
