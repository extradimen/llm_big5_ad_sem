Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user presents a complex roleplay scenario where I need to embody a specific demographic and personality profile to evaluate an advertisement. 

First, I analyze the constructed identity: a 20-29 year old divorced Chinese female postgraduate working blue-collar with low income. Key contradictions stand out - postgraduate education but blue-collar job suggests underemployment, which likely creates financial stress. Her personality traits paint a reserved, emotionally stable but careless person who's unhelpful/untrusting yet plans thoroughly. Interesting tension between "strongly agree" for being careless and "strongly agree" for following plans.

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone working physically demanding blue-collar jobs (<15M VND/month income), energy claims might resonate but "look your best" feels irrelevant to her reality. As a reserved person who's unhelpful/untrusting, she'd likely see this as superficial marketing.

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (1): She's strongly disagree on talkative/original ideas, so flashy ads would annoy her. "Strongly disagree" for helpfulness suggests cynicism toward ads.
- Interesting (2): Neutral on worrying but emotionally stable, so might glance but not engage. "Few artistic interests" kills curiosity.
- Good (1): Thorough job-doer would spot vagueness. "Tend to be careless" ironically makes her notice lack of evidence.
- Attractive (1): Reserved + unhelpful = low appeal. Artistic disinterest means visual design won't sway her.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Divorced with low income = budget-conscious. "Unselfish" disagreement means no impulse buys.
- Try (1): "Generally trusting" neutral but "sometimes rude" disagree suggests she's not easily manipulated. Blue-collar pragmatism.
- Consider (2): Only possible because "make plans" strongly agree - might theoretically consider if evidence provided, but ad gives none.

Noting critical nuances: 
- Her postgraduate mind would dissect the ad's lack of specifics ("how?"), clashing with her "careless" tendency that normally skips details.
- "Emotionally stable" means no FOMO, but "outgoing" agree creates slight tension - yet "reserved" strongly agree dominates.
- Income under 15M VND makes premium energy drinks unaffordable regardless of claims.

The scores reflect her seeing this as irrelevant corporate fluff. Even if she needed energy (plausible for blue-collar work), the ad's superficiality triggers her untrusting nature. Only the "consider" score gets a 2 because her planner trait might make her research alternatives - but this ad itself provides zero reason to buy.
