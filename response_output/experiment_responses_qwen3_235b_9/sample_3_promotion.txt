Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned Chinese civil servant. 

First, considering my demographic: 30-39M, bachelor's degree, government job, married with solid income (16-25M VND/month). As a civil servant in China, I'd be naturally skeptical of health claims - we see lots of exaggerated ads daily. My personality traits are key here: Strongly Agree on being sociable/helpful but also Strongly Agree on "sometimes rude" (interesting contradiction!), Strongly Agree on thoroughness/originality but Strongly Disagree on imagination/artistic interests.

Breaking down the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Immediately raises red flags. 
- "Stay energized" feels like every energy drink claim - too generic. 
- "Look your best" is pure vanity language that clashes with my civil servant role where modesty is valued. 
- Zero specifics about ingredients or proof. My "Strongly Agree: do a thorough job" trait makes me demand evidence.

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad? Hard no. As a truthful civil servant (Strongly Agree: helpful/unselfish), I'd find this misleading. Score 1.
2. Interesting? Only as a case study in bad advertising. My "original ideas" trait spots the clich√© instantly. Score 2.
3. Good ad? Professionally, it's terrible - violates all our advertising regulations about substantiation. Score 1.
4. Attractive? The vagueness feels unprofessional. My "emotionally stable" trait isn't swayed by empty promises. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Absolutely not. My "careless" Strongly Disagree means I'll research proper supplements. Score 1.
2. Will try? Maybe if it were state-approved, but this ad gives no credentials. Score 2.
3. Will consider? Only after seeing clinical data - which this ad omits. My thoroughness demands proof. Score 3.

Noting my "sometimes rude" trait - I'd probably mock this ad to colleagues! But professionally, I'm scoring based on civil service skepticism, not rudeness. The ad fails on credibility (my "Neutral: generally trusting" means I need proof) and relevance (as a married civil servant, "look your best" feels frivolous).

Key contradiction: Though I'm sociable (Strongly Agree outgoing), this ad feels like something I'd warn elderly relatives against. My government role makes me protective of consumers.
