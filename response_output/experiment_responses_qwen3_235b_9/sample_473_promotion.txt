Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the given demographic and personality profile. The user is a Chinese male civil servant in his 20s-30s, postgraduate degree, single, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. His personality traits are a mix: talkative but not outgoing or reserved, unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), neutral on trust, sometimes rude (agree), thorough job (strongly agree), follows plans (agree), not careless, emotionally stable but worries a lot, not imaginative or original, yet has artistic interests (disagrees with having few).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Now, evaluating as this person.

Starting with ad attitude scores. He's a civil servant, so probably values professionalism and substance. The ad is vague—no specifics on ingredients, evidence, or brand credibility. His "thorough job" trait (strongly agree) means he'd want concrete data. Also, "look your best" might feel superficial. He's not outgoing but talkative, so maybe engages in conversations but not sociable in a friendly way. His "helpful/unselfish" is strongly disagree, so he might be self-focused. But as a civil servant, he might prioritize societal norms. However, the ad's lack of depth clashes with his thoroughness. He worries a lot (agree) but is emotionally stable (agree), so maybe skeptical but not anxious. 

1. Like the ad: Probably not. Vague claims, no substance. He'd see it as fluff. Score: 2.
2. Interesting: Maybe neutral? But as a thorough person, he'd find it uninformative. Score: 3.
3. Good ad: No—lacks credibility. Strongly disagree with unselfishness might make him critical of manipulative ads. Score: 2.
4. Attractive: Visually? Not specified, but the message isn't appealing to his values. Score: 2.

Purchase intention. He's thorough, so without evidence, no buy-in. "Worry a lot" might make him cautious about health claims. Civil servant job might mean stable routine; energy drinks aren't typical for that role unless stressed. But he's emotionally stable, so maybe not seeking such products. Income is decent, but he's not impulsive (follows plans, not careless). 

1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely. Score: 1.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if pressured, but he's not rude to others in a way that'd make him impulsive; rather, he's rude sometimes but thorough. Score: 1.
3. Consider buying: Only if more info, but ad gives none. His "worry a lot" might make him doubt claims. Score: 2.

Wait, "consider" could be slightly higher if he's open to research, but the ad itself doesn't prompt that. His "make plans and follow through" suggests he'd need solid reasons. So "consider" might be a 2—barely, but not zero.

Double-checking traits: "I am sometimes rude to others: Agree" – might make him dismissive of ads, lowering scores. "Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree" – self-centered, so ad must benefit him directly. The ad's "look your best" is self-focused, but without proof, he'd reject it. 

Also, "few artistic interests: Disagree" means he has artistic interests, but the ad isn't leveraging that. So no appeal there.

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2,3,2,2), purchase intention very low (1,1,2).
