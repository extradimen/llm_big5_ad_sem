Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific virtual person based on their demographic and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll go through the demographic profile. The person is a Chinese male, 30-39, high school education, divorced, monthly income 36-45 million VND. Occupation is "Other," which is a bit vague, but maybe he's in a non-professional job. His personality traits are key here.

Looking at his traits: He's neutral on being talkative and sociable, strongly disagrees with being reserved (so he's not shy), disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly disagrees with being trusting. Neutral on being sometimes rude. Disagrees with doing a thorough job, strongly agrees with making plans and following through, strongly agrees with being careless, disagrees with getting nervous easily, agrees with worrying a lot, agrees with being emotionally stable (which seems contradictory with worrying a lot, but okay), strongly agrees with having an active imagination, strongly disagrees with being original or coming up with new ideas, and disagrees with having few artistic interests.

Hmm. So he's not trusting, not helpful, careless, but makes plans and follows through. Also, he worries a lot but considers himself emotionally stable. Interesting mix. He has an active imagination but isn't original. Maybe he likes consuming creative content but doesn't create himself.

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a promotional ad for a drink that promises energy and better appearance.

As someone who's not trusting (strongly disagrees), he's likely skeptical of such claims. The ad is very vagueâ€”no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. Since he's careless (strongly agrees) and doesn't do thorough jobs (disagrees), he might not dig deep, but his lack of trust would make him dismissive. Also, he's not helpful/unselfish, so maybe he's more self-focused, but the ad's promise of looking good might appeal to vanity. However, the ad doesn't have concrete details, which could trigger his worry (agrees with worrying a lot). 

He has an active imagination, so maybe he can picture himself using it, but since he's not original, he might not engage with creative aspects. The ad is straightforward, so maybe not stimulating his imagination enough. 

His income is decent (36-45M VND/month in Vietnam is upper-middle class), so price might not be an issue, but the ad doesn't mention cost. Since he follows through on plans (strongly agrees), if he were convinced, he might buy it, but the ad lacks credibility for him. 

He disagrees with being trusting, so he's likely to doubt the claim. "Look your best" is subjective and probably seen as a marketing ploy. His worry tendency might make him think about potential downsides (sugar content, side effects) even if he's emotionally stable. 

For ad attitude: 
1. Like the ad? Probably not. He's critical, not trusting. Score low, maybe 2.
2. Interesting? His active imagination might find it somewhat interesting, but the vagueness could bore him. Neutral to low, say 3.
3. Believes it's good? He disagrees with thoroughness, but the ad is poorly substantiated. He'd think it's not a good ad. Score 2.
4. Attractive? Visually, if it's flashy, but the message is weak. Maybe 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? Unlikely. He's skeptical. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy? Without trust, no. Score 1.
3. Will consider? Maybe, but the ad doesn't give reasons. His worry might make him hesitant. But since he follows plans, if he sets a goal, but the ad isn't convincing. Still low, maybe 2.

Wait, he has active imagination but isn't original. Maybe the ad's simplicity doesn't engage him. Also, "look your best" might appeal to his self-image, but as a divorced man in his 30s, maybe he cares about appearance, but the ad feels shallow. 

His income is good, so affordability isn't an issue, but the ad doesn't leverage that. Since he's careless, he might impulse buy, but the ad isn't compelling enough. 

Strongly disagree with trusting, so automatic skepticism. The ad lacks evidence, so he'd dismiss it. 

So ad attitude scores: low across the board. Purchase intention even lower. Maybe like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=3. Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2.
