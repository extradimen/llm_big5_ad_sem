Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. His high income (16-25M VND/month) is interesting - that's actually quite affluent for Vietnam, but he's single and blue-collar which creates some tension. His personality shows strong contradictions: extremely talkative yet not sociable? That's unusual. He strongly agrees with being thorough and plan-oriented but also admits to being careless sometimes. The emotional instability stands out too - disagrees with being emotionally stable despite disagreeing with worrying a lot. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a blue-collar worker over 60, "look your best" feels irrelevant - he's probably not concerned with appearance like younger people. "Stay energized" might resonate since physical work is tiring, but... wait, he disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and is emotionally unstable. Might make him skeptical of health claims. 

His strong "do a thorough job" and "follow through" traits suggest he'd value concrete evidence, but the ad gives none. His "active imagination" (strong agree) might make him visualize scenarios, but "few artistic interests" (neutral) means probably not swayed by aesthetics. Most crucially - he "strongly disagrees" with being original/coming up with new ideas, so he likely prefers traditional solutions over trendy drinks.

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (1): Too vague, feels like snake oil to him. His "sometimes rude" neutrality suggests he'd dismiss it as nonsense.
- "Interesting" (2): Only slightly because "energized" touches his work reality, but superficial.
- "Good" (1): Lacks substance he values as a thorough worker.
- "Attractive" (1): Zero visual/emotional pull for him.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to buy" (1): He's practical - needs proof, not promises.
- "Will try" (2): Maybe out of curiosity since he's talkative, but very unlikely.
- "Consider" (3): Only because he follows plans, but he'd research alternatives first.

Noting his high income doesn't matter here - blue-collar mindset prioritizes utility over premium products. And being emotionally unstable but not worried? Might make him irritable toward ads he perceives as manipulative.
