Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese civil servant in his 20s with the specified traits. His profile shows strong contradictions - he's both "Strongly Agree" for being talkative and reserved, which is interesting. Also notable: he's emotionally stable but gets nervous easily, and has an active imagination but isn't original. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant with moderate income (16-25M VND/month), he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others and "Neutral" on helpfulness suggests he'd view this as manipulative marketing. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's reserved and untrusting - probably dislikes flashy ads. 
- Interesting (2): His active imagination might engage slightly, but "look your best" feels shallow for a civil servant.
- Good (1): Thorough job trait means he'd demand evidence; ad provides none.
- Attractive (1): Neutral artistic interests + distrust = finds it unattractive.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend (1): His "make plans and follow through" trait means he researches properly; this ad lacks credibility.
- Try (2): Might test it once out of curiosity (active imagination), but unlikely.
- Consider (3): Only if he sees scientific backing later (thorough job tendency).

Wait - his "emotionally stable" but "nervous easily" creates tension. Maybe he'd consider energy drinks for work stress? But "look your best" undermines credibility for a serious civil servant. No, scores stay low. 

Double-checking income context: 16-25M VND is decent but not lavish in urban China. He wouldn't splurge on unproven products. And as a single govt worker, "look your best" might feel irrelevant to his professional identity.

Final scores reflect: deep skepticism (trust issues), need for evidence (thorough job), and mismatch with civil service values. Only tiny curiosity points from imagination trait.
