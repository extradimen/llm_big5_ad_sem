Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to act as a Chinese male over 60 with a high school education, divorced, and a monthly income over 46 million VND. My personality traits are given, and I need to evaluate this ad about a drink that claims to keep you energized and looking your best.

First, looking at the demographic. Being over 60, health is probably a big concern, but also skepticism towards quick fixes. High school education might mean I'm not overly technical but value practical info. Income is high, so price isn't an issue, but maybe I'm cautious with spending on unproven products. Divorced status might mean living alone, so maybe less concern about appearance for social reasons, but still wanting to feel good.

Now, personality traits. I'm not talkative (Disagree with being talkative), neutral on outgoing, disagree with being reserved. So maybe I'm somewhat social but not overly so. Agree that I'm helpful/unselfish, but strongly disagree with being trusting. That's key—distrustful. Also, strongly disagree with being rude, so polite but skeptical. Strongly disagree with doing a thorough job, so maybe not detail-oriented. Neutral on planning and being careless. Strongly agree with getting nervous easily, but strongly disagree with worrying a lot. Hmm, that's interesting—nervous but not a worrier? Maybe anxious in the moment but lets it go. Strongly disagree with being emotionally stable, so mood swings? Disagree with active imagination and original ideas, agree with few artistic interests. So practical, not creative.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

As a skeptical, distrustful older man, I'd question this. "Stay energized" might appeal since aging can bring fatigue, but "look your best" might not resonate as much—I'm past the age where appearance is a priority, especially divorced. But the distrust is a big factor. Ads making health claims without evidence would rub me the wrong way. Also, since I get nervous easily and am emotionally unstable, maybe I'm sensitive to false promises. 

For ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: Probably not. Distrustful, so I'd dislike the vagueness. Score low, maybe 2.
2. Interesting: Neutral? But distrust might make it uninteresting. Maybe 3.
3. Believes it's good: Strongly disagree with trusting, so "good" ad? No, feels manipulative. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Not really, since it's not credible. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: No way. Distrustful and skeptical. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Unlikely. No evidence provided. Score 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe, but only if more info, but as is, probably not. Still low, maybe 2.

Wait, but income is high, so maybe willing to try if convinced. But the distrust trait is strong. Also, "helps you stay energized" might have some appeal for energy, but without specifics, it's not convincing. Since I'm not thorough and careless, maybe I wouldn't research it, but the distrust would override any impulse. 

So ad attitude scores: low across the board. Purchase intention even lower. Maybe 1s and 2s.
