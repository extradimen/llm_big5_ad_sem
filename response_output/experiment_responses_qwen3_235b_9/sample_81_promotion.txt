Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese blue-collar worker described. I'm a 40-49 year old divorced man with a postgraduate degree but working in a blue-collar job, earning under 15 million VND monthly. That's interesting because my education level is higher than typical for my occupation - maybe I ended up in this field due to circumstances. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm strongly talkative but also agree that I'm reserved? That seems contradictory at first glance. But maybe it means I'm chatty with people I know well but quiet in new situations. I'm helpful and trusting (agree), thorough at work (agree), but also strongly agree that I tend to be careless - that's an odd combination for someone who does thorough work. Hmm, perhaps I'm careful with important tasks but sloppy with routine ones. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, I definitely need energy - that part resonates. But "look your best" feels irrelevant to me. I'm divorced, in my 40s-50s, working with my hands - appearance isn't my priority. Also, with my income under 15 million VND (~$600 USD), I'm budget-conscious. 

I'm emotionally stable (strongly agree) and don't get nervous easily (disagree), so health anxiety isn't driving me. But I worry a lot (neutral) - maybe about finances since I'm divorced with presumably lower income now. The ad doesn't address practical concerns like cost or how it specifically helps with physical labor fatigue. 

My talkative nature (strongly agree) means I might discuss ads with coworkers, but the "look your best" angle feels superficial for a manual laborer. I'm original with ideas (agree) but have strong artistic interests (strongly disagree with "few artistic interests"), so I appreciate creativity but not fluff. 

For the scores:
- Ad attitude: 
  Like? Maybe 3 - neutral on the energy claim but turned off by "look your best." 
  Interesting? 2 - too generic, doesn't speak to my reality. 
  Good? 3 - technically well-made but irrelevant. 
  Attractive? 2 - no visual appeal for me. 

- Purchase intention:
  Intend to buy? 1 - no way, it's probably expensive. 
  Will try? 2 - only if heavily discounted. 
  Will consider? 3 - might glance at it if coworkers mention it, but low priority.
