Okay, let me approach this as a Chinese woman over 60 with the given profile. 

First, considering her demographic: she's a civil servant with high school education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly (which is quite substantial for her age group in Vietnam). Her personality traits show she's sociable but not particularly helpful/unselfish, not trusting, thoroughness-disagree, but she does follow plans and has original ideas. Important note: she strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable - that's interesting, might indicate some underlying anxiety despite denying worry.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a retired civil servant in her 60s, "look your best" might feel irrelevant since she's past beauty-focused marketing. The energy claim could resonate with aging concerns, but her distrustful nature (strongly disagree on trusting) makes her skeptical of such claims. 

Her "do a thorough job: disagree" suggests she might not research products deeply, but "make plans: agree" implies she follows routines. However, "helpful/unselfish: strongly disagree" means she prioritizes personal benefit over others' opinions. 

Key conflict: The ad feels superficial for her life stage. At 60+, "look your best" might even feel patronizing. Her originality (agree) could make her dismiss clich√© claims, while distrust makes her question efficacy. Monthly income is high but she's frugal by civil servant nature - unlikely to splurge on unproven drinks. 

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, doesn't speak to her needs
- Interesting (2): Slightly curious but skeptical
- Good (1): Poorly targeted, lacks credibility
- Attractive (1): Visually probably irrelevant to her

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in claims
- Try (2): Might if family insists, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if doctor recommends, but ad itself unconvincing

Noting she might buy for health reasons despite disliking ad, but the ad gives no medical credibility. Her "emotionally unstable" trait (strongly disagree) is contradictory but taken at face value suggests she rejects the notion - so she'd dismiss emotional appeals.
