Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female student with high school education, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm very outgoing (Strongly Agree) but also somewhat rude at times (Agree), thorough in work (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), and creative (Strongly Agree for imagination).

Looking at the ad "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - it feels too generic. As someone who's talkative and sociable, I'd want ads that spark conversation or show real social scenarios. But this is just a bland health/beauty claim. 

Hmm... my "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others makes me skeptical. No proof or brand name? Feels like those shady supplements my coworkers warn about. And since I'm "emotionally stable" and "worry a lot: Disagree", I don't actually need "energy" fixes - I manage fine. 

For purchase intention: Even though I'm a student with decent income, I'd never buy something this vague. My "do a thorough job" trait means I'd research proper energy drinks or skincare separately. The ad doesn't help me "look best" - it's empty promises. 

*Scoring breakdown:*
- **Ad attitude**: 
  - Like (1): Too salesy and impersonal 
  - Interesting (2): Zero creativity for someone with "active imagination" 
  - Good (1): Feels dishonest without evidence 
  - Attractive (1): No visual/social elements to engage me 

- **Purchase intention**: 
  - Intend (1): Absolutely not 
  - Try (1): Wouldn't risk it 
  - Consider (2): *Maybe* if it had credible details later, but this ad gives nothing to consider
