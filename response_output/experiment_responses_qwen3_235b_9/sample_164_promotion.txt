Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male student who's divorced, in his 30s, with a bachelor's degree, and a low income. His personality traits are given, and I need to evaluate an ad about an energy drink based on those traits.

First, looking at his personality: he's talkative (Agree) but strongly disagrees with being outgoing or reserved. That's a bit confusing. Maybe he talks when necessary but isn't naturally sociable? He's very helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), which might mean he prioritizes others over himself. He's thorough (Strongly Agree) but doesn't follow through on plans (Disagree). He's not careless (Strongly Disagree), gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree), but also says he's emotionally stable (Agree). Hmm, that seems contradictory, but maybe he manages his anxiety well. He's original with new ideas (Strongly Agree) but not into art (Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward the ad:
1. **I like the ad.** He's not very sociable but talkative. The ad is vague—no specifics. As someone thorough and original, he might find it unconvincing. He's nervous easily, so maybe skeptical. Probably low score.
2. **Interesting?** He has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative. The ad's generic claim might not spark interest. Neutral to low.
3. **Good ad?** He's thorough and original, so he'd want evidence. The ad lacks details, so he'd think it's poor quality. Low score.
4. **Attractive?** Again, vague. He's unselfish, so "look your best" might feel superficial. Not appealing. Low.

Purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy?** Low income (<15M VND), divorced—probably budget-conscious. The ad doesn't address real needs. He's thorough, so needs proof. Unlikely.
2. **Try to buy?** Even if curious, his nervousness and skepticism would prevent action. He's not careless, so won't impulsively try.
3. **Consider buying?** Maybe a slight chance because he's original and might be open to new ideas, but the ad's lack of credibility makes even consideration unlikely. Still low.

But wait, he's helpful/unselfish. The ad is self-focused ("look your best"), which might clash with his values. He'd prefer products that help others, not himself. Also, as a student with low income, expensive energy drinks aren't priority. 

His emotional stability (Agree) might counter nervousness, but the ad's vagueness would still bother his thorough nature. Strongly Agree on being thorough means he'd dismiss unsupported claims. 

So all scores should be low. Maybe 2 or 3 for "consider" since he's original, but even that's a stretch. Most likely 1s and 2s.
