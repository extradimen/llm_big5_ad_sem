Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male manager with a postgraduate degree, married, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm sociable and talkative (Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), but not particularly trusting or helpful (Disagree on both). I'm original with new ideas (Agree) but not artistic (Disagree). 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a managerial employee with emotional stability, I'm skeptical of vague health claims. The ad feels too generic - no specifics about ingredients or scientific backing. My "Disagree" on trustworthiness makes me question this immediately. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. I'm critical by nature (Disagree on being helpful/unselfish) so generic ads annoy me. Score 2.
- Interesting? My "Strongly Disagree" on imagination means I don't engage with fluffy claims. Score 2.
- Good? As a thorough worker (Neutral on thoroughness), I expect substance. This lacks credibility. Score 3.
- Attractive? My artistic interests are low (Disagree) but even I see this as visually unimpressive. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. My income is modest (<15M VND) and I distrust such claims. Score 1.
- Will try? Maybe if colleagues recommend it, but ad alone? Unlikely. Score 2.
- Consider? Only if I see clinical proof, which this lacks. Score 2.

Noting that emotional stability (Strongly Agree) makes me less swayed by "look your best" promises - I know real energy comes from sleep, not drinks. My managerial role means I've seen too many hollow marketing claims. The ad feels like it's targeting younger people, not middle-aged professionals like me.
