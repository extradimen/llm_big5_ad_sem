Okay, let me approach this as the persona described. 

First, analyzing the demographic: young Chinese male blue-collar worker earning 26-35 million VND monthly. That's actually quite high for a high school dropout in Vietnam (average blue-collar wage is ~5-10 million VND), but I'll take the profile at face value. Divorced under 20 seems unusual but possible in some contexts.

Key personality traits that jump out:
- Strongly agrees with being outgoing/sociable but also strongly agrees with getting nervous easily. Interesting contradiction - maybe extroverted but socially anxious?
- Strongly disagrees with being thorough/helpful, disagrees with planning. Suggests impulsive, maybe unreliable tendencies.
- Disagrees with being emotionally stable, which aligns with the nervousness.
- Disagrees with having few artistic interests - so he does have some creative side despite disagreeing with "active imagination".

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- As a sociable but nervous young worker, he might care about energy for socializing but "look your best" feels superficial. Given he's blue-collar, appearance claims might seem irrelevant to his daily work. 
- His low conscientiousness (disagrees with thorough job/planning) means he probably won't scrutinize the claim, but strong disagreement with being unselfish suggests he's self-centered - might appreciate "look your best" angle.
- However, he's emotionally unstable and nervous - might distrust vague health claims. "Stay energized" could appeal to his likely fatigue from physical work.

For purchase intention:
- High income for his age/status suggests he can afford it, but strongly disagreeing with being thorough implies low research habits. 
- But he's not trusting (only "agrees" generally, not strongly), and the ad gives zero proof. Blue-collar workers often prefer practical, demonstrable benefits - "look your best" is too vague.
- His impulsiveness might make him try it once, but low conscientiousness means no habit formation.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude:
- Like (3): Too generic, doesn't resonate with his actual daily struggles
- Interesting (2): Zero creativity, doesn't spark curiosity 
- Good (2): Feels like empty marketing speak to someone who's practical
- Attractive (3): Maybe visually appealing but claims feel hollow

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not - no concrete reason to believe it
- Try (2): Might grab it once out of boredom but won't seek it
- Consider (3): Only if he sees coworkers using it (his sociability factor)
