Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, low income, and specific personality traits. The ad is for a drink that claims to keep you energized and looking your best. 

First, looking at the demographic: he's elderly, on a tight budget (under 15M VND/month), and lives with parents. That probably means he's cautious with money, especially since he's past retirement age. His personality traits are key here. He strongly disagrees with being thorough or following plans, strongly agrees with being careless and worrying a lot, and disagrees with trusting others or being unselfish. He's also emotionally unstable but has an active imagination.

Hmm, the ad says "stay energized and look your best every day." For an older person, "look your best" might feel irrelevant—maybe he's past caring about appearances, or it could even annoy him if he feels ads target younger people. "Stay energized" might resonate a bit since aging saps energy, but... wait, his traits say he worries a lot and is emotionally unstable. He'd probably be skeptical. The ad doesn't give any proof—no ingredients, no studies—so his strong distrust (he "strongly disagrees" with being generally trusting) would kick in. He'd think it's too good to be true, maybe even scammy. 

Also, his income is low. Spending money on a "miracle" drink? Unlikely. He disagrees with being unselfish, but that's more about not helping others—not directly relevant. His carelessness and lack of follow-through mean he wouldn't bother researching if it's legit; he'd just dismiss it. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like the ad? Nah, it feels shallow. He's imaginative but not in a naive way—he'd see through vague claims. Score 1 or 2. 
- Interesting? Maybe a tiny bit because of his active imagination, but no substance. Still, low—2. 
- Good? Not at all; feels manipulative. 1. 
- Attractive? Visuals might not matter to him; he's practical. 1. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. He's skeptical and broke. 1. 
- Try to buy? Why would he? No trust. 1. 
- Consider? Maybe if it were dirt cheap, but the ad gives no reason to believe it works. Still, 1—no consideration. 

Wait, his "worry a lot" trait might make him overthink it, but distrust overrides that. And "emotionally unstable" could mean he's impulsive, but his carelessness suggests indifference, not impulsivity. Yeah, all scores should be low. 

Double-checking: the ad doesn't address his needs (e.g., health concerns for elderly) or budget. It's generic. He'd ignore it. Final scores: all 1s except maybe "interesting" at 2 because of imagination, but even that feels forced. Nah, stick with 1s—it's too vague to spark real interest.
