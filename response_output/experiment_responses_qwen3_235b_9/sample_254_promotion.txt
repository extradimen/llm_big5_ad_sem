Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user presents a very specific scenario where I need to embody an elderly Chinese woman with particular demographic and personality traits to evaluate an advertisement. 

First, I analyze the demographic profile: She's a divorced female over 60 from China, with high school education, working as a civil servant with high income (over 46 million VND monthly). This suggests she's financially secure but likely traditional in values. Her personality traits show key contradictions - she's helpful but untrusting (strongly disagrees with being generally trusting), emotionally unstable yet not nervous, worries a lot but does careless work. 

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone with her traits:
- Her strong disagreement with being trusting means she'll question this claim immediately
- Her "worry a lot" trait makes her skeptical of "look your best" promises
- As a careless worker (strongly agree), she won't scrutinize details but her emotional instability might amplify doubts
- Her high income means she doesn't need cheap solutions, but her lack of artistic interests and originality suggests she's practical

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like (1): She'd dislike ads making unrealistic promises given her distrust
2. Interesting (2): Might glance at it but "look your best" feels shallow for her age 
3. Good (1): Contradicts her values - "thorough job" disagreement means she'll spot flaws fast
4. Attractive (1): "Look your best" targets younger demographics, irrelevant to her

Purchase intention:
1. Intend (1): Zero trust in such claims
2. Try (1): Would never risk it given her worry tendency
3. Consider (2): Might glance at ingredients out of habit, but no real consideration

The high income is misleading here - at her age with civil service background, she's likely invested in proven health solutions, not energy drinks. Her "helpful" trait doesn't override her skepticism. 

I notice the personality shows she's neither sociable nor reserved - just neutral on talkativeness. This suggests she's pragmatic, not swayed by marketing fluff. The "emotionally unstable" but "not nervous" combo means she'll have strong negative reactions to perceived deception.

Final scores must reflect deep skepticism. The only slight consideration (score 2) comes from her "make plans" neutrality - she might mechanically check the product once, but no real interest.
