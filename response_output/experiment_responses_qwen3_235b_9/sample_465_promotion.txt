Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific demographic profile and personality to evaluate an advertisement critically. 

First, I need to internalize the persona: a Chinese male over 60, divorced student with high income but very reserved personality. Key traits stand out - he strongly disagrees with being talkative or helpful, strongly agrees with being reserved and sometimes rude, and disagrees with being original or thorough in planning. Interesting contradiction - high income but student status suggests maybe retired professional pursuing studies.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For this persona, several disconnects emerge immediately:
- At his age, "look your best" feels irrelevant (aging is natural)
- "Stay energized" might even offend - implies he's lacking energy
- His strong rudeness trait means he'd likely dismiss it as shallow marketing
- Disagrees with being unselfish, so won't care about others' opinions on his appearance
- Strongly disagrees with new ideas, so won't be swayed by product claims

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: He'd hate the superficiality (1)
- Interesting: Too generic for someone who disagrees with active imagination (1)
- Good: Violates his value of thoroughness - no evidence provided (2)
- Attractive: "Look your best" is age-insulting (1)

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend: He's emotionally unstable but doesn't worry - might be impulsive but ad triggers his rudeness (1)
- Try: Disagrees with helpfulness, so no altruistic trial (1)
- Consider: Disagrees with planning/follow-through, but ad lacks credibility for him (2)

Noting his high income doesn't matter here - personality overrides purchasing triggers. The ad's focus on appearance/energy directly clashes with his self-perception as a reserved, no-nonsense older man. His strong rudeness trait is key - he'd probably scoff at this.

Double-checking scale: 1 is strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree. All scores should be low since he rejects the ad's premise entirely. Only "consider" gets 2 because maybe out of sheer boredom as a student, but even that's a stretch.
