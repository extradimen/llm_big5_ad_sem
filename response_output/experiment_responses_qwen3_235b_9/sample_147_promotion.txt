Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 50-59 year old Chinese blue-collar worker. His profile says he's a male with high school education, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's not talkative or sociable (strongly disagrees with outgoing traits), but agrees he's helpful yet sometimes rude. He's thorough, plans meticulously (strongly agrees), but gets nervous easily (strongly agrees) while disagreeing he worries a lot. Emotionally stable? He agrees. Artistic interests? Neutral.

Now looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy matters - but "look your best" feels off. Construction or factory work isn't about appearances. He'd probably scoff at the vanity angle. 

His "strongly agree" on nervousness but "disagree" on worrying is interesting - he might feel anxious but suppresses it. The ad's vague promise could trigger skepticism. And with his "disagree" on trusting others? Yeah, he'll doubt this claim. No doctor or evidence mentioned - feels like snake oil to him. 

Also, his "strongly disagree" with being outgoing but "agree" on being helpful... he'd care about family (parents he lives with), but this ad doesn't connect to that. Just "you" focused. Not relevant. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like? Hard no. Score 1. 
- Interesting? Nah, too shallow. 2. 
- Good? Feels dishonest. 2. 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate with his reality. 1. 

Purchase intention? 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. 1. 
- Will try? Maybe if cheap, but ad doesn't convince. 2. 
- Will consider? Only if peer-recommended, not from this ad. 3. 

Wait - his "agree" on being thorough means he'd research alternatives. This ad gives zero substance. And his monthly income is decent (26-35m VND is above avg in Vietnam), but he's practical. No way he wastes money on this fluff.
