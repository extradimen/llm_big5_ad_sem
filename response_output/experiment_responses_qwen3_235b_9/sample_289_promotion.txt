Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 20-year-old Chinese female civil servant with specific traits. First, I need to internalize her profile: postgraduate degree but low income (<15M VND), lives with parents, strongly disagrees with being talkative/outgoing but strongly agrees with worrying a lot and being original.

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this character, I'd immediately notice red flags. Her "Strongly Agree" on worrying means she'd scrutinize vague claims. "Look your best" feels superficial - she strongly agrees she has few artistic interests, so appearance-focused messaging won't resonate. 

Her civil servant job implies skepticism toward commercial claims. She "disagrees" with being generally trusting, so "helps you stay energized" sounds like empty marketing to her. Also, "do a thorough job" is Strongly Disagree - she'd spot the lack of evidence. 

Wait, she "strongly agrees" with being original but "strongly agrees" she has few artistic interests. Interesting contradiction - probably means she values innovation in practical ways (like civil service efficiency), not aesthetics. So the ad's generic promise feels unoriginal to her innovative side.

Her purchase intention? Monthly income is tight (<15M VND â‰ˆ $600), and she "agrees" she's careless. She'd think: "Why waste money on unproven drinks when I worry about finances?" But as a civil servant, she might "consider" it neutrally for energy during work - hence the 4 for "consider" (not buying, but not dismissing outright).

*Double-checking scores*: 
- Ad attitude all low (2-3) because she finds it untrustworthy and irrelevant to her values. 
- Purchase intention: 1 for intend/try (no way), but 4 for consider (civic duty might make her objectively evaluate options). 

Yep, this aligns with her "worry a lot" trait making her skeptical, but "helpful to others" (Agree) meaning she won't be rude about it - just quietly dismissive.
