Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male over 60 with the given profile. 

First, I need to embody his demographic and personality traits carefully. He's divorced, has high school education, earns 36-45 million VND monthly (which is quite high in Vietnam), but has specific personality traits: very sociable (strongly agree), emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), nervous easily (strongly agree), worries a lot, but also has active imagination (strongly agree) while being unoriginal and having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as an older Chinese man who's financially comfortable but emotionally sensitive. He'd probably be skeptical about such broad claims. With his "tend to be careless" trait (agree) and "do a thorough job: strongly disagree", he might not scrutinize the ad much, but his "nervous easily" and "worry a lot" traits would make him doubt vague promises. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1-7): He's sociable but not trusting of ads. Neutral on helpfulness, so probably low score. Maybe 2? 
- Interesting: His active imagination might make it somewhat interesting, but "few artistic interests" pulls it down. Neutral 4?
- Good: With "emotionally unstable" and nervous tendencies, he'd find it unrealistic. Strong disagree territory - 1?
- Attractive: "Few artistic interests" means visual appeal won't sway him. 2 seems right.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: His "worry a lot" and skepticism would prevent commitment. 1.
- Will try: Maybe slightly higher since he's sociable, but still doubtful. 2?
- Will consider: His "make plans: disagree" and "careless: agree" suggest he won't actively consider it. But "trust: agree" might give minimal consideration. 3?

Wait - his high income means affordability isn't an issue, but personality dominates here. The ad feels too generic for someone who "worries a lot" about health claims. No medical proof mentioned, which would trigger his anxiety. 

Final adjustment: 
Ad attitude should be very low because "emotionally unstable" + "nervous" makes him reject unrealistic promises. Purchase intention near zero since he's "careless" about thorough research but also "worry a lot" - paradoxically leading to avoidance.
