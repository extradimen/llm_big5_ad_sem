Okay, let me approach this as a 60+ Chinese female blue-collar worker with the given traits. 

First, I need to embody her profile: single, bachelor's degree but blue-collar job, income 16-25M VND (which is actually quite high for Vietnam but might be plausible for expat or special case). Personality-wise, she's quiet (disagrees with talkative), sociable but reserved, not helpful/unselfish (strongly disagrees), emotionally stable but worries a lot (interesting contradiction), creative with artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as an older blue-collar worker, she probably deals with physical fatigue. But "look your best" feels irrelevant - at her age, beauty standards matter less than health. She's emotionally stable but worries a lot, so "stay energized" might resonate with work demands, but the ad feels too superficial. 

Her traits matter here: 
- Strongly disagrees with being unselfish → won't care about ads targeting generosity
- Neutral on trusting → skeptical of vague claims
- Worries a lot but emotionally stable → might fixate on "is this safe?"
- Artistic/imaginative → but ad has no creative elements to engage her

Also, she's reserved and not talkative - flashy ads would annoy her. "Look your best" sounds like youth-focused nonsense to a 60+ woman. As a thorough worker (agrees), she'd want concrete evidence, not empty promises. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? (1) Too generic, feels manipulative 
- Interesting? (2) Only if she's exhausted, but ad doesn't address real needs
- Good? (1) Poorly targeted, no credibility 
- Attractive? (1) Visuals not described but concept feels shallow

Purchase intention:
- Intend? (1) Zero trust in "magic solution" 
- Try? (2) Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad doesn't suggest that
- Consider? (3) Only if she's desperate for energy, but ad doesn't prove effectiveness

Wait - her high income (16-25M VND ≈ $650-1000) is confusing for Vietnamese context. But since it's given, I'll assume she's not price-sensitive, but still won't buy without proof. Her "do thorough job" trait means she'd research alternatives instead of trusting ads.

Also noting: she strongly disagrees with being careless, so random drink purchases are unlikely. The ad's vagueness triggers her worry tendency ("is this healthy?").
