Here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, presented in the requested JSON format, reflecting my background and personality:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 4, 3, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (2):** I'm not naturally inclined to enthusiastically *like* anything overtly presented, and this ad feels quite generic. It ticks boxes, but doesn’t capture my interest. My reserved nature makes me less susceptible to feeling immediately charmed by advertising.
*   **Interesting (4):** The concept of ergonomic comfort *is* somewhat intriguing given my managerial role and likely desk-bound work. It's not groundbreaking, but the promise of improved comfort does hold some mild interest.
*   **Good (3):** It's a reasonably competent advertisement. It identifies a clear benefit (comfort) and uses appropriate keywords ("ergonomic," "lumbar support"). It's not *bad*, but not particularly innovative.
*   **Attractive (3):** The ad likely portrays a clean, modern design, which isn’t intrinsically *unattractive*, but it doesn’t have any visual elements that really grab my attention or appeal to any sense of aesthetic preference I might have.

*   **Intend to Purchase (1):** I'm very skeptical by nature (Disagree on generally trusting), and this ad doesn’t address those concerns. I'm unlikely to buy something simply based on a general claim of comfort.
*   **Try to Buy (2):** Perhaps if I had a specific, pressing back pain issue, I *might* research this product more, but it’s not on my immediate radar.
*   **Consider Buying (4):** If I were actively searching for a chair, *ergonomic* features would be a criteria and this ad might appear and cause me to read reviews.
