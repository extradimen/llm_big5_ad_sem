Okay, here's my evaluation of the GreenCare laundry detergent ad, presented in the requested JSON format, reflecting my persona's background and personality. I've tried to be honest and critical.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "eco_product",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 1, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (3):** I'm not strongly against it. The concept of plant-based and biodegradable is…fine. I don't *hate* it.
*   **Interesting (1):** Honestly, it’s not grabbing my attention. I've seen this type of ad a million times. It doesn’t feel fresh or new.
*   **Good (3):** It's *okay*. It's a decent message, but it doesn't feel particularly impactful. The 'tough on stains' bit feels tacked on and generic.
*   **Attractive (2):** Visually, I'm not seeing anything that excites me. It probably features green leaves and a smiling family – predictable and boring.

*   **Intend (1):** No. I'm not actively planning to buy it. I buy the cheapest detergent that seems to get the job done.
*   **Try (2):** I *might* consider it if it was on a really good deal, but that’s a big “if.”
*   **Consider (3):** It’s not completely off my radar. If I was feeling particularly guilty about the environment (which is rare), I might think about it.
