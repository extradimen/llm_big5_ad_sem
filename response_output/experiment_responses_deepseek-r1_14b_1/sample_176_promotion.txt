Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a female office worker from China under 20, married, earning around 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm outgoing and helpful but tend to be careless and have an active imagination.

Looking at the ad's message: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad.** The ad is positive and makes me feel good, which I agree with on a neutral level. It doesn't strongly resonate but isn't disliked either.
2. **Interesting.** The benefits mentioned are appealing, especially for someone looking to stay energized and look good, so I think it's somewhat interesting, scoring a 4.
3. **Good.** Since the ad is well-constructed with clear benefits, it feels good, but not exceptional. A 5 seems fair.
4. **Attractive.** The message is appealing, especially for someone like me who values looking good and staying energetic, so I find it attractive enough to give a 6.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase.** While the benefits are nice, I'm not convinced enough to intend buying it right away. A 3 reflects that.
2. **Try to buy.** It's something I might consider trying once or twice, but no strong intent yet. Another 3.
3. **Consider buying.** The ad makes me think about the product, so a higher score of 4 is appropriate.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective, it doesn't strongly influence my immediate purchase decision due to other factors like current preferences and habits.
