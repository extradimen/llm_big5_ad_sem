Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 40-49 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND and I live with my parents. From the personality traits, I'm talkative but not very outgoing, helpful, trusting, careful, and emotionally stable.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break this down.

First, attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, being helpful and unselfish makes me think ads should be useful for others, but the claim to help with energy and appearance is vague. Maybe it's not specific enough. So maybe a 3 on a scale of 1-7.

2. Is it interesting? The idea of looking your best daily could be appealing, especially if someone wants to present well at work or social events. But I'm not sure how compelling it is. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's positive and makes you feel better, but without specific benefits, it might come off as too generic. So perhaps a 4.

4. Is it attractive? The message is appealing in theory, but without seeing visuals or specific claims, maybe not very吸引人. Maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy it? Probably not, because the ad doesn't provide concrete reasons why this drink would work better than others. So a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? Maybe if someone else recommends it or there's a deal, but not based on the ad alone. Another 4?

Wait, no, maybe lower. If the ad isn't persuasive enough, perhaps a 3.

3. Will I consider buying it? Since the idea is about energy and looking good, which are relevant to many people, including professionals, maybe a 5.

I'm not sure if I'm being too critical here. The ad could be targeting busy individuals who want to look their best, but without specific evidence or unique selling points, it's hard to justify spending money on it. So my scores might reflect that.
