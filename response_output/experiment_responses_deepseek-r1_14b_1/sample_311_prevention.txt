Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience is a 60+ year old Chinese woman with a managerial position, divorced, earning between 36 to 45 million VND monthly. She has a bachelor's degree, which suggests she might be quite educated and possibly values quality.

Personality-wise, she's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. She's helpful and unselfish, generally trusting but sometimes rude. She does thorough work, makes plans, isn't careless, doesn't get nervous easily, worries occasionally, is emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original with new ideas, but has few artistic interests.

Now, evaluating the ad: The ad focuses on preventing tiredness and dull appearance without the drink. Since she's talkative and thorough, she might appreciate a product that helps her maintain energy and perhaps look good, especially if she's in a managerial role where appearances matter.

But considering she strongly disagrees with being outgoing or reserved, maybe she values more practical aspects rather than social image. The ad is about prevention—feeling tired and looking dull. She's agreeable but neutral on worrying a lot, so the fear of feeling tired might resonate if she's active in her work.

She has an active imagination and original ideas, which could mean she's open to products that offer benefits beyond the obvious. But with her high income, she might be more selective about what she buys.

Now, attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: She might not strongly like it because prevention messages can be seen as negative. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: It's a clear message but perhaps not very engaging for someone with an active imagination. Maybe a 3.
3. Good: The message is straightforward and addresses real feelings, so maybe a 4.
4. Attractive: Since she isn't outgoing, the ad might not be visually appealing to her. Perhaps a 2.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: She's thorough but doesn't feel strongly about it yet. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Not sure if she'll make an effort without more compelling reasons. Maybe a 4 (neutral leaning towards try).
Wait, no—if she is neutral on the ad's attractiveness, maybe her intent isn't high. Alternatively, perhaps she might consider it but not intend or try immediately. So maybe [3, 3, 5] for intentions?

Alternatively, considering her thorough nature, she might be more likely to consider after some thought. Maybe:

Purchase intention scores: [4, 3, 5]. Wait, no—original thought was lower.

Wait, let me reconsider:

She is helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), which suggests she values the product's benefits for herself. The ad targets tiredness and dull appearance, which might affect her professional image as a manager. So, if the drink helps her stay energetic and look good, it could be appealing.

But she is emotionally stable (neutral) and doesn't get nervous easily (disagree), so maybe she isn't swayed by anxiety-based ads. The ad uses "may feel tired," which is mild. She's agree on making plans and following through, so if she likes the product, she might intend to purchase.

But the ad's message is about prevention, which could be a good fit for someone who values health and appearance. However, she has few artistic interests (strongly agree), so maybe the ad's creativity isn't a factor for her.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 4
2. Interesting: 3
3. Good: 4
4. Attractive: Maybe she doesn't find it visually appealing, but the message is clear—so perhaps 4? Or maybe lower because she isn't outgoing.
Wait, considering her personality, she's talkative but not outgoing. The ad might be seen as too social or not relevant to her. So maybe:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 3, 4, 4]

Purchase intention:
She is thorough and makes plans, so if she finds the ad good, she might intend to buy. But since she's neutral on the ad's attractiveness, perhaps she isn't strongly compelled. Maybe purchase intention scores are lower.

Alternatively, she might not feel a strong emotional connection but could consider it because of practical benefits. So:

Purchase intention: [3, 4, 5]

Wait, no—maybe higher for considering buying because even if she doesn't intend to buy right now, the product's benefits make her think about it. So perhaps:

Ad attitude scores: [4, 3, 4, 4]
Purchase intention: [3, 4, 5]

But I'm not fully confident here. Maybe the ad is more about prevention which she might value, so higher on good and attractive.

Alternatively, since she's over 60 and possibly more health-conscious, the ad could be appealing, making her态度 higher.

I think I need to settle on scores that reflect a somewhat positive attitude but not strongly so, with purchase intentions being moderate to high.
