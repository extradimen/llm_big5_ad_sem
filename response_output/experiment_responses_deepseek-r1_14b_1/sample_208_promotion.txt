Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad. Let me break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're a Chinese male over 60, have a bachelor's degree, work as a blue-collar worker, are divorced, and earn between 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, they're talkative, outgoing, not reserved, neutral about being helpful, very trusting, sometimes rude, thorough, makes plans, not careless, not nervous, doesn't worry much, emotionally stable, has an active imagination but isn't too original or artistic.

The ad is for a drink that helps stay energized and look best every day. So, the key points are energy and appearance. 

Let me start with their attitude toward the advertisement. They like ads if they're relevant and trustworthy. Since they value trust (strongly agree), the ad's credibility matters. The message seems positive but maybe too generic.

1. I like the ad. - Hmm, do they connect with it? It talks about energy and looking good. Maybe not directly appealing since they might focus more on practicality or health benefits rather than appearance. So perhaps a 3.
2. Interesting. - Not sure if it's interesting enough; maybe neutral at 4.
3. Good. - Itâ€™s positive, but without specific details, maybe around 4.
4. Attractive. - The visuals might matter, but without knowing the ad's style, I'll go with a 5.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Not sure yet; maybe 3.
2. Try to buy? Might consider if others recommend, so 4.
3. Consider buying? Possibly yes, as it's about energy which could be important for someone active or needing stamina; so 5.

I think these scores balance their practical side and skepticism towards generic claims but also their openness to helpful products.
