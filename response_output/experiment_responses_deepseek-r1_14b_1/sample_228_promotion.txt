Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad is short and uses positive language that appeals to feeling energized and looking good. It resonates a bit but doesn't strongly connect with me due to other factors.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - While the message is clear, it's quite generic and doesn't offer unique selling points, so I'm not particularly interested.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - It has a positive message but lacks specifics about how the drink actually works or its benefits, making me neutral on believing in it.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visual and wording are simple and appealing, so I agree more on this point.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Without specific details or a strong emotional hook, my intention is low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - There's some interest in the benefits mentioned, but it's not enough to push me to action.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The ad does make me think about the product, so I'm somewhat inclined to consider it.

Overall, while there are positive aspects, the lack of depth and personal connection means my scores remain moderate.
