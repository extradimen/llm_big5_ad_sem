Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese blue-collar worker would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience here is someone in their 30s-40s, married, with a decent income but maybe not too high. He works as a blue-collar worker, which means he might be physically active or working in a demanding job that could lead to fatigue. His personality traits include being talkative, outgoing, helpful, trusting, emotionally stable, and original. However, he doesn't do thorough jobs, isn't good at following through with plans, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot, and has an active imagination.

Starting with the ad's message: feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since he's in a demanding job, fatigue is relatable. The ad taps into his need to stay alert and presentable. His personality traits show he's concerned about social interactions since he's outgoing and helpful. So, the fear of looking dull might resonate with him because he values his social image.

He’s emotionally stable but gets nervous easily. Maybe this drink could help him manage stress or maintain energy levels, which is a plus. However, he doesn’t plan much and tends to be careless, so maybe ads that emphasize quick fixes would appeal more than long-term solutions.

Considering the attitude toward the ad: Does he like it? It's interesting because it speaks to his potential needs but might feel manipulative if it's too direct about appearance. He’s trusting but also somewhat nervous, so the ad could be seen as a bit pushy.

For purchase intention: He has an active imagination and is original, which means he might consider trying new products, especially if they promise noticeable effects. But since he doesn't follow through on plans, the intention to actually buy it might not be very high unless there's an immediate need or strong incentive.

I think his scores would reflect that the ad is somewhat interesting but maybe a bit over the top for him. He might believe it's good because it addresses real concerns but isn't strongly attracted to it. As for purchase, he might consider buying it but isn't fully committed.
