Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive benefits. Since I'm a student, energy is important, but I don't feel a strong connection to this message. It's somewhat appealing but not enough for me to strongly like it. So, maybe a 4.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of looking good and having energy is relatable, especially with a busy student life. However, the ad feels a bit generic. Not extremely interesting, so perhaps a 5.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** While the message isn't harmful, it doesn't stand out as particularly truthful or convincing. I don't see anything wrong but nothing exceptional either. A middle score of 4 makes sense.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** The promise sounds nice, but without any specific details or emotional appeal, it's not very attractive to me. So, a 3 seems fair.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I don't feel strongly motivated by the ad. There are too many similar products out there, and nothing in the ad makes me want to choose this one specifically. A 2 here.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Even though I'm somewhat interested in the benefits, without a compelling reason or personal connection, trying it isn't something I'm considering much. Maybe a 3.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** There's some minor interest because staying energized is useful, but without more information or a strong emotional hook, it's on the lower end of consideration. A 4 feels right.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate deeply with me due to its generic nature and lack of personal relevance beyond surface-level benefits.
