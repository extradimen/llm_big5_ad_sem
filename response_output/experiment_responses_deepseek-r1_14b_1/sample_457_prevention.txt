Okay, let's break down how I arrived at my scores for this ad evaluation. 

First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My initial thought is that it's targeting someone looking to stay energized and presentable. Since I'm a student with a busy schedule, feeling tired is something I can relate to.

Looking at the attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The message is clear and directly addresses potential issues of fatigue and appearance. It resonates because it's a relatable concern for many people. So, on a scale from 1 to 7, I'd give it a 6 because I find it effective but maybe a bit too direct.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The concept is straightforward but not particularly unique. It uses common concerns about energy and appearance, which are widely marketed themes. So, my score here would be a 5—interesting enough but nothing groundbreaking.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** While the message is clear, I feel it's somewhat overused in advertising. Effective but not innovative. A 4 seems fair because while it communicates its point well, there's room for more creativity.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visual appeal of the drink and the promise of looking sharp might attract me. However, without seeing the actual visuals, I'm basing this solely on the text, which is a bit limiting. So, a 5 seems right—moderately attractive based on the message alone.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My current routine includes energy drinks, so if this one offers a unique benefit or is positioned well, I might consider it. But without more info, my intent isn't strong yet—a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There are so many options out there; I'd be more inclined to try it if there's something different about it. Maybe a 4 because the ad makes me think of giving it a shot once.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** The ad definitely makes me aware of it, which is the first step in considering purchase. So, a 5 here as I'm now thinking about whether to include it.
