Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my scores. Starting with the ad attitude: 

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which aligns with a desire for daily improvement. Being outgoing and talkative, I appreciate an ad that's positive and motivating. However, since I'm reserved in some traits, maybe not as much. Still, it feels somewhat appealing, so around a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but lacks specific details about how it achieves these benefits. With my tendency to be careless, I might not find it extremely interesting. So, a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: For me, trust is low. Given that I'm generally distrustful and don't find ads very credible, believing this ad feels tough. A 2 makes sense.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The ad's tone might appeal to someone outgoing, but since I'm not as trusting, it doesn't draw me in much. Maybe a 3 for attractiveness.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Ads without specifics make me cautious. With a strong tendency towards carelessness and being unimpressed by the ad's message, my intent is lowâ€”probably a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without clear benefits or trust in the ad, trying it isn't compelling. A 1 here reflects that hesitation.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: While I'm not dismissing it entirely, considering it doesn't feel strong either. Maybe a 3, indicating mild consideration without much enthusiasm.
