Alright, let me break down how I came up with the scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The tagline is positive and relatable for someone looking to stay energized and presentable. Given my personality traits, being helpful and thorough, this message aligns well. However, the ad feels a bit generic, so I'm not overly enthusiastic. That's why it's a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The claim about staying energized and looking good is appealing, but without specific details on how the drink achieves these benefits, it lacks depth. So, a 4 makes sense here.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: It's a clear message, but lacking evidence or specifics makes me hesitant to fully trust it. A 5 seems appropriate as I'm neither strongly convinced nor dismissive.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The overall presentation might be visually appealing, but without more compelling information, it doesn't stand out enough for me. So, a 5 again.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: While the benefits are appealing, I'm not convinced without proof of effectiveness or specific benefits tailored to my needs. Thus, a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some interest, but hesitation due to lack of information. Maybe a 3 here.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's on the radar, but not a definite purchase yet. A 5 feels right as it's something I might think about more if given more info.
