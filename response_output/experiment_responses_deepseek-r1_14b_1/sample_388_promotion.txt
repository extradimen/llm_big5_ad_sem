Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let's break this down based on the demographic profile and personality traits provided.

First, let's consider my background: I'm a male from China over 60, have a postgraduate degree, work in an office, am divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My income is relatively low for someone with my education, so cost might be a concern.

Looking at my personality traits:
- Talkative and outgoing: I like social interactions, so maybe ads that highlight social benefits could appeal to me.
- Helpful and unselfish: I care about others' well-being, so an ad that emphasizes health or helping others might resonate.
- Generally trusting? No, I strongly disagree. So, trust is a factor here. If the ad seems trustworthy, it's better; if not, it won't convince me.
- Sometimes rude: I agree. Maybe this trait makes me more direct in my evaluations.
- Thorough job: Neutral. I don't know how this affects my response to the ad.
- Make plans and follow through: Agree. I like ads that suggest a routine or plan.
- Careless? Disagree. So, maybe attention to detail is important for me.
- Get nervous easily? No. Not too relevant here.
- Worry a lot? No. So stress isn't a big motivator for purchases.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral. Probably not much impact either way.
- Active imagination and original ideas? I strongly disagree. Maybe ads with creative elements might not be my cup of tea.
- Artistic interests: Neutral.

Now, the ad focuses on staying energized and looking good every day. As someone over 60, maybe energy is a concern, but looking good might not be as much of a priority. However, since I'm still working in an office, appearing presentable could matter to me for professional reasons.

The ad's message is positive, which might align with my helpful and unselfish traits if it suggests contributing to health or well-being. But the trust issue is a concern—does the ad come across as reliable? If it seems too exaggerated, I might not believe it.

Considering purchase intention: My income is low, so price would be a big factor. Even if the product sounds good, affordability matters. Also, as an office worker, maybe I have busy days and need something to help with energy, but I'm cautious about health products' claims.

For attitude toward the ad:
1. Like it? The message is positive, but if it feels too much like a sales pitch without credibility, I might not like it.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, so maybe not very interesting unless there's something unique.
3. Good: If it provides clear benefits and is trustworthy, then yes; otherwise, no.
4. Attractive: The visuals would matter—does the ad have appealing imagery that makes me want to look at it?

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Probably not immediately unless I feel a strong need or trust the product.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if someone else recommends it, but on my own, probably not.
3. Consider buying: It might be in the back of my mind, especially if others find it useful.

So, overall, the ad has some positive aspects that align with my values, but credibility and cost are big factors that could hold me back from being persuaded to buy.
