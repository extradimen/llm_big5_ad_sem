Alright, I need to evaluate how a specific person would react to this ad. Let me break down the demographics and personality traits first.

The person is from China, female, in her 40s, has a bachelor's degree, works as a managerial employee, is divorced, with a monthly income between 16 million to 25 million VND. Her personality traits are quite talkative, not very outgoing but neutral on that, strongly disagrees being reserved which means she's probably more social. She's helpful and unselfish, tends to trust others, sometimes neutral on rudeness, doesn't do thorough jobs, makes plans and follows through, isn't careless, isn't easily nervous or worried, is emotionally stable, lacks an active imagination, not original with ideas, and has neutral artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive. It's a prevention message because it warns about negative consequences without the product.

Now, considering her traits:

1. Talkative and somewhat social (outgoing neutral), so she might relate to the need to stay energized and presentable in social situations.
2. Being helpful and trusting makes her more likely to believe the ad's claims.
3. She doesn't find ads that require a lot of thoroughness appealing, but this ad is straightforward.
4. Emotionally stable and not easily nervous, so the message might not stress her out.

For ad attitude:
1. Like: The straightforward message could appeal, but she might not be strongly positive about it (maybe 5).
2. Interesting: It's a common theme, but given her personality, maybe around 4.
3. Good: She values trust and helpfulness, so perhaps 5.
4. Attractive: The ad is simple, maybe 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Prevention messages can be effective for her, so 5.
2. Try to buy: Might not feel compelled immediately, but considering her stable nature, maybe 4.
3. Consider buying: She plans and follows through, so she might consider it (5).

Overall, scores would reflect moderate interest in the ad and consideration towards purchasing.
