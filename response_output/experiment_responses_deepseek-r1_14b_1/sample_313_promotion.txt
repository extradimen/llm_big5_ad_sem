Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let me start by understanding her demographic and personality traits.

She's from China, female, aged 50-59, high school education, not working, divorced, with a monthly income of 36â€“45 million VND. That's quite a decent income in Vietnam, so she might be more open to purchasing higher-end products.

Looking at her personality traits: She agrees that she's talkative and trusting but disagrees on being outgoing or helpful. She strongly agrees that she does thorough jobs and makes plans, which shows she's methodical. She doesn't get nervous easily and is emotionally stable.

Now, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: Since she's talkative and trusts people, she might not dislike ads but being reserved, maybe she isn't overly enthusiastic. So a 4.
2. Interesting: The message is clear but may not grab her attention much as it's a common claim. A 3.
3. Good: It's positive, so she might find it good, maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: Not particularly visually appealing to her reserved nature, perhaps a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: She makes plans and is thorough, so if the ad resonates with her need for energy, she might intend to buy. A 6.
2. Try: She's cautious but trusts, so maybe a 5.
3. Consider: Definitely on her radar, so a 7.

Wait, considering her income level, she might be more likely to try new products. Maybe adjust the try score higher? Or perhaps she's careful with purchases. Hmm. I think initial scores make sense.
