Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as someone with a specific demographic and personality. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My role is a woman from China, over 60 years old, married, with a bachelor's degree, earning between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. I'm a student, so maybe I have some time but also financial constraints? Hmm.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing and helpful, which makes me social and caring. But I tend to be reserved, so maybe the ad needs to connect on an emotional level without being too pushy. I don't trust people easily, which might make me skeptical of ads. I worry a bit but am emotionally stable. I have an active imagination and original ideas, which means I appreciate creative ads.

Looking at the ad's message: feeling tired and looking dull are negatives that people want to avoid. The drink is positioned as something you can't do without because it prevents these negative outcomes. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, maybe this ad appeals to my desire to maintain energy and appear well to others. But being reserved might mean I don't feel the need to impress everyone all the time.

I’m a student, so perhaps I have busy days where staying alert is important. The drink could help with that. However, considering my monthly income is quite high, maybe I can afford better options, but this ad targets basic needs—energy and appearance.

Now, for the态度 toward the advertisement:

1. Like: The message seems straightforward and relevant to feeling tired, which I might relate to if I'm studying or socializing a lot. But the language is simple, so maybe it's not very engaging. I'd give it a 4.
2. Interesting: It’s not particularly creative or new. Just stating a common problem. A 3 feels right.
3. Good: The message is clear but doesn't have anything special about it. Maybe a 4.
4. Attractive: Not really visually appealing or emotionally compelling, so a 2.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Since the ad focuses on preventing tiredness and dull looks, which I care about, maybe I would consider it. A 5.
2. Try to buy: But there's no strong reason to choose this drink over others, so probably not immediately. Maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: It’s an option if other factors like price or convenience are right. So a 5.

Wait, let me check again. The ad is about looking dull without the drink—maybe I don't see myself as someone who needs to change how others perceive my appearance that much. Plus, being over 60, maybe tiredness is more relevant than looking dull? Maybe that's why I'm giving lower scores.

I think these scores make sense based on my personality and the ad's content.
