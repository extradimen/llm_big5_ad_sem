Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the given scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the **ad态度 (attitude toward the advertisement)**:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad's message focuses on avoiding tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Given that I strongly agree to being talkative but neutral about being outgoing, the ad might not directly resonate because it doesn't emphasize social interactions heavily. However, the idea of feeling energetic is appealing, so I'm somewhat positive but not strongly so. Hence, a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The ad's premise is relatable—everyone wants to avoid looking tired. It's a common concern, making it interesting. My score here is 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the message is clear and relevant, I don't find it particularly compelling or innovative. It feels standard, so my belief in its effectiveness is moderate at 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual aspect of looking tired versus refreshed could be appealing, but without more emotional depth, it's just okay. My score here is 3.

Moving on to **purchase intention**:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The ad targets a feeling I can relate to, but it doesn't provide enough unique value or evidence. So, while I'm somewhat inclined, my intent isn't strong—score 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Given that the ad is somewhat convincing and considering my personality traits, especially being helpful and trusting, trying it might be a consideration. But without more motivation, it's neutral at 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: The message makes me think about the possibility of purchasing, but there are other factors I'd need to weigh. Hence, a 4 as I'm leaning towards considering it.
