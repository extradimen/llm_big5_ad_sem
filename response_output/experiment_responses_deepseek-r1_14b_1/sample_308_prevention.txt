Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at their demographic profile: they're a Chinese civil servant over 60 with a postgraduate degree and a high income. They’re divorced, which might affect their lifestyle choices or social circles. Their education level suggests they're probably detail-oriented and analytical, which could make them more critical of advertisements.

Now, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key here is that it's a preventive ad. It’s targeting people who are concerned about feeling tired and looking less energetic or dull. Given their age, they might be particularly interested in staying alert and maintaining their appearance.

Looking at their personality traits: They’re helpful, which means they care about others' well-being. However, they don't trust others much, which could make them skeptical of the ad's claims. They disagree with being talkative or outgoing, but strongly agree to being original and having an active imagination. So they might appreciate creative ads but not overly social ones.

For their emotional traits: They get nervous easily and worry a lot but are disagreeable in other areas. The ad doesn't seem to play into their anxiety directly, so maybe it's not something that would trigger them positively or negatively.

Considering the purchase intention questions: If they like the ad, they might be more inclined to consider buying it. But given their skepticism (disagree with trusting others), they might need more evidence before intending to buy. However, since they make thorough plans and follow through, once convinced, they could act on it.

Scoring-wise:
- Ad attitude: They're neutral about being talkative but have other traits that might lead them to find the ad somewhat interesting but not necessarily like it a lot. Maybe 4 for like, 5 for interesting, 3 for good, and 4 for attractive.
- Purchase intention: They’re analytical and might not feel an immediate need, so lower scores here. Perhaps 2 for intend, 3 for try, and 4 for consider.

Overall, they're on the fence but might give it a thought if convinced of the benefits.
