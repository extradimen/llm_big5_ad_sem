Alright, I need to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

They're from China, female, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work as a civil servant, are divorced, and earn between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income for Vietnam, which might influence her spending habits—she could be more inclined to buy premium products.

Looking at her personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing/Sociable: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful/Unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes Rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough Job: Strongly Disagree
- Plans and Follows Through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Disagree
- Gets Nervous Easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worry a Lot: Neutral
- Emotionally Stable: Disagree
- Active Imagination: Neutral
- Original/New Ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic Interests: Disagree

So, she's reserved, not very trusting, sometimes rude, but makes plans and follows through. She doesn't like being talkative or outgoing, which might make her less responsive to ads that emphasize socializing or being around others.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target someone's energy levels and social image. Since she's reserved and values following through on plans, maybe she's looking for something that helps her stay energetic and focused, especially since her job as a civil servant might be demanding.

However, she doesn't find ads interesting or good because she's not outgoing or talkative. The ad relies on making someone feel tired and dull without the product, which could resonate with her if she values appearing sharp and professional. But given that she strongly disagrees with being talkative and outgoing, maybe the social aspect isn't a strong motivator for her.

On purchase intention, does she intend to buy? She's methodical (makes plans and follows through), but she doesn't do thorough jobs. Maybe she’s practical but not overly concerned about every product. The ad's message is clear but might not be compelling enough because it focuses on social image rather than functionality or health benefits.

She scores a 3, maybe, for intending to purchase—maybe neutral towards trying, considering the price point and her income level could allow her to consider premium products, but she doesn't feel strongly about the ad. She's emotionally stable (disagree), so might not be swayed much by emotional appeals in ads.

So, putting it all together, the ad is somewhat good but not very interesting or attractive to her. She has a neutral consideration towards buying, possibly leaning towards trying if reminded, but no strong intention.
