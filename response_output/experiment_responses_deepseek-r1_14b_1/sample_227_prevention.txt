Alright, let me break this down. I'm a Chinese woman in my late thirties with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, single, and earning between 26 to 35 million VND a month. My personality traits include being talkative and outgoing but also reserved, helpful, sometimes rude, careless, trusting or not? Wait, I strongly disagree with being generally trusting. Hmm.

So the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting fatigue and appearance concerns. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, maybe I have a physically demanding job that makes me tired. But wait, blue-collar can vary; some jobs are more mental. I'm in my 30s, so looking good might still be important.

I'm talkative and outgoing, which means social interactions are important to me. If the ad is about not looking dull, that could resonate because I probably want to make a good impression socially. However, being reserved might mean I don't always express my need for such products outwardly. 

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and dull looks. Since I'm sometimes careless (strongly agree), maybe I don't prioritize these things as much. Also, worrying a lot (agree) suggests I might be concerned about how others perceive me, so the idea of looking dull could be a concern.

But wait, I strongly disagree with being generally trusting. So I might question whether this drink is effective or if it's just another marketing ploy. Credibility could be an issue here. If I don't trust the ad, my attitude towards it might not be very positive.

Looking at purchase intention: I agree that I make plans and follow through, which might mean once I decide to buy something, I do so. But considering I'm careless and sometimes rude, maybe I'm more impulsive in decisions, but since this is a drink related to looking good, it's a product I might not prioritize over other expenses.

Putting it all together: The ad touches on points that could matter to me—looking good and feeling energetic—but the lack of trust and being careless might make me less likely to be swayed. So my attitude towards the ad would be somewhat mixed—maybe interesting because it's addressing social concerns, but not necessarily something I strongly like or believe in. Purchase intention is low because while I might consider it, there are other factors at play.

For the scores:
- Like: 3 (I don't dislike it, but it doesn't excite me)
- Interesting: 4 (It does touch on social aspects, so somewhat interesting)
- Good: 2 (I don't think it's particularly effective or truthful)
- Attractive: 3 (Not very attractive to me personally)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 2 (Unlikely to intend buying)
- Try: 2 (Might not try it)
- Consider: 4 (Could consider, but probably wouldn't act on it)
