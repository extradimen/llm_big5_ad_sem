Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: it suggests that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. Given my personality traits, being over 60 and a civil servant, maybe I'm concerned about staying energetic and looking good. But the ad seems a bit manipulative, using fear to sell the product. 

I scored the ad's attitude low because it feels more like a negative push rather than something positive or inspiring. It makes me feel pressured, which isn't appealing. The message is clear but not particularly engaging for someone who values emotional stability and isn't easily swayed by such tactics.

On purchase intention, I'm neutral. While the idea of feeling tired is relatable, especially in my age group, there are so many products out there making similar claims. Without more evidence or a personal need that this drink specifically addresses, I don't feel compelled to buy it. Trying it or considering it long-term doesn't seem necessary unless there's a strong reason.
