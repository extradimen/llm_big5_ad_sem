Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their background and personality. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience is likely someone looking to stay energized and appear presentable.

The person is a Chinese male in his 30s-39s, works as a civil servant, living with parents, high income (>46 million VND). His personality traits include being outgoing but reserved, helpful, not trusting, sometimes rude, neutral on thoroughness, making plans, not careless, gets nervous easily, doesn't worry much, emotionally stable, no active imagination, not original, and has few artistic interests.

So, he's a bit of an introvert but still sociable. He might value staying energized to maintain his social life but perhaps isn't too concerned about looking dull in a professional setting since he's a civil servant with a high incomeâ€”maybe he feels confident already.

The ad's message is about the negative consequences of not using the product: tiredness and looking dull. Since he's reserved, maybe he doesn't want others to notice if he's tired, so the fear of appearing dull might resonate. But on the other hand, his personality traits like being emotionally stable and not having an active imagination make him less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals.

He is helpful and unselfish, but that might relate more to his interactions rather than product usage. His distrust makes me think he might question the ad's credibility. He doesn't worry a lot, so maybe he's not as concerned about feeling tired as someone who worries more.

Looking at attitude toward the ad: 
1. Like: The message is straightforward but may not be appealing since it's fear-based and he's somewhat reserved. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme, so maybe neutral, around 4.
3. Good: Not particularly compelling, perhaps 3.
4. Attractive: Not visually or conceptually appealing to him, maybe 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: High? Maybe not, because while he might consider the benefits, his personality traits don't push him towards immediate action. Perhaps a 3.
2. Try: He's neutral on trying new things, so maybe around 4.
3. Consider: He might think about it but isn't convinced yet, so perhaps a 4.

I'm not sure if this is accurate, but I think these scores make sense based on his traits.
