Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the given advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

The person is a Chinese male in his 50s with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, divorced, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's not very talkative or outgoing, somewhat reserved, helpful and unselfish, but not trusting. He tends to be neutral about being rude, not thorough in his work, doesn't make plans, is careless, gets nervous easily, isn't a worrier, has an active imagination, and is somewhat original.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's targeting energy and appearance. 

Starting with attitude towards the ad:
1. I like the ad. – Since he's reserved and not talkative, maybe the ad doesn't appeal much. He might not find it likable.
2. Interesting – The active imagination trait might make him think it's somewhat interesting but not very so.
3. Good – As a civil servant, he values trust, but since the ad is vague, it might not seem good to him.
4. Attractive – If he's reserved, maybe the ad isn't visually or conceptually appealing.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy – Given his income and cautious nature, probably low.
2. Try to buy – Maybe neutral as he might consider but not sure.
3. Consider buying – Possibly on the lower side due to lack of trust in ads.

So scores: ad attitude around 2-4; purchase intention maybe 3 or below each.
