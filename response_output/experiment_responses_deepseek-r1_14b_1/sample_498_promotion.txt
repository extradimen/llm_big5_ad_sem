Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40-49 year old Chinese man with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker and currently divorced. My monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which is about $1,600 to $2,000 USD. 

Looking at my personality traits, I scored low on being talkative, outgoing, reserved, helpful, trusting, rude, emotionally stable, having an active imagination, and originality. I was neutral about doing a thorough job, careless, nervous, worried, and had few artistic interests.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, thinking about my attitude towards the ad: Do I like it? The ad is positive but seems a bit too general. It doesn't speak to me personally. As someone who's more reserved and not very outgoing, maybe I wouldn't find it interesting. But since staying energized could be useful for work, maybe I'm somewhat interested. So, 3.

Is the ad interesting? Maybe not because it's targeting looking good and energy, which might not resonate with me as much. I rate this a 2.

Is the ad good? It's well-made but lacks personal relevance to me. I give it a 3.

Do I find it attractive? The message is positive, so maybe a 4.

For purchase intention: Do I intend to buy it? Probably not because I'm more focused on practical needs and this seems like a luxury item. So, 2.

Will I try to buy it? Maybe if someone else recommends it, but not my first choice. Another 2.

Will I consider buying it? Possibly, but only after trying other options or seeing more evidence. A 3.
