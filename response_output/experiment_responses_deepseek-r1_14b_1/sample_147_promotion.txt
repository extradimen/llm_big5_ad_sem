Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to evaluate an advertisement for a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day, based on my demographic profile and personality traits. 

First, understanding the ad: It's targeting someone who wants energy and looks. The key benefits are being energized and looking good daily.

Now, considering my background: I'm from China, female, under 20 with a bachelor’s degree, an office worker, divorced, earning between 36–45 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so maybe I can afford such products. But being in a lower bracket within that range might make me consider costs.

Personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly disagree. So, not very social.
- Outgoing: Disagree. Not really into social activities.
- Reserved: Neutral. Sometimes reserved but not always.
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree. Maybe not the most helpful person.
- Trusting: Strongly disagree. Probably skeptical of ads.
- Rude sometimes: Agree. Might come off as rude, which could affect how I perceive the ad's messaging.
- Thorough job: Disagree. Not very detail-oriented.
- Plans and follow through: Disagree. Maybe not someone who sticks to plans.
- Careless: Strongly agree. Often overlooks details or makes mistakes.
- Nervous easily: Strongly agree. Might be anxious, affecting decision-making.
- Worry a lot: Strongly disagree. Not a worrier, perhaps.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly disagree. So, maybe more volatile emotionally.
- Active imagination: Disagree. Not very creative or imaginative.
- Original and new ideas: Agree. Value uniqueness and innovation.
- Artistic interests: Strongly disagree. Probably not into arts.

So, looking at the ad's message: It's about energy and looking good. Since I'm reserved and sometimes rude, maybe I don't care much about social acceptance related to appearance, but being energized is a personal benefit.

I am helpful? Not so much, but the ad doesn’t really focus on that. Trusting? No, which makes me question the ad's credibility. The fact that I tend to be careless and make plans without following through might mean I don't prioritize such products unless they offer significant benefits.

Emotionally, I'm not very stable and get nervous easily. So stress-relief or energy boost could be appealing if it helps with anxiety. But since I’m skeptical of ads, the claims need to be strong.

The ad says "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Being original and valuing new ideas might make me interested in a product that's marketed as unique. However, artistic interests are low, so design or aesthetics might not influence me much.

Considering purchase intention: My income is decent, but I'm careless with money? Maybe not. But the ad’s claims need to be believable. Since I don't trust ads much, the message might not resonate unless supported by evidence.

I worry a lot? No, but I do get nervous easily. So maybe the drink's promise of looking good could appeal if it's tied to confidence.

Now, evaluating的态度:

1. Like the ad: Maybe 3. Not very positive, but it's trying to help.
2. Interesting: 4. It's a common claim, so not too interesting.
3. Good: 3. It’s okay, but not great because of skepticism.
4. Attractive: 4. The idea is appealing, but I'm not sure.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: 2. Slightly inclined if convinced.
2. Try to buy: 3. Might consider it.
3. Consider buying: 4. Possibly after more info.

I think my scores would be around these numbers because the ad isn't a perfect fit but has some appeal due to energy and looking good, despite skepticism.
