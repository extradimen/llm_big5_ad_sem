Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. First, I'll go through each part step by step.

So, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target demographic is a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, working as a managerial employee, living with parents, earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (neutral), reserved (agree), helpful and unselfish (disagree), trusting (agree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough job (disagree), makes plans (strongly agree), careless (strongly disagree), gets nervous easily (strongly agree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), active imagination (strongly disagree), original and creative (strongly agree), few artistic interests (strongly disagree).

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad. Well, she is talkative and outgoing is neutral, but reserved agrees a bit. She might not find it overly likable if it's too upbeat. Maybe around 3.

2. Interesting. The ad talks about energy and looking good. She values staying energized, maybe because of her busy job. So, interesting? Maybe a 4.

3. Good. It makes sense, but she worries a lot and is careful with decisions. The ad seems positive but may not strongly persuade her. Perhaps a 4.

4. Attractive. Given she's reserved, maybe the ad isn't visually appealing enough for her. She might score lower here, like a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She makes plans and follows through (strongly agree). The drink seems useful, so maybe she would intend to buy it. A 5.

2. Try to buy: Since she's thorough but sometimes rude, she might not rush to try it immediately. Maybe a 4.

3. Consider buying: Given her thoughtful nature, she would consider it, especially if others recommend or she trusts the brand. So, a 5.
