Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given that I'm in my 30s, I might be juggling work and family, so energy is important. However, the wording feels a bit generic and not tailored to me specifically. It doesn't trigger any strong emotions or speak directly to my needs, so maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of looking your best is appealing, but it's a common message in many ads. Without unique visuals or specific benefits, I'm not particularly interested. A 3 makes sense here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** For an ad to be believable, it needs concrete evidence or testimonials. This ad lacks specifics and seems too vague. My trust in such claims is low, so a 2 feels right.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals might be appealing, but without seeing them, I can't say for sure. If they're generic stock images, they might not resonate. A neutral 3 fits as I'm undecided.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Without specific benefits or a strong emotional hook, the ad doesn't push me towards buying. Maybe a 4 if there's some curiosity, but likely lower without more info.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's no incentive or reason to choose this over others. A 3 seems fair as I might not prioritize it unless convinced otherwise.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** While it's not a top choice, the idea of energy and appearance could make me think about it if reminded again. So, a 4 is reasonable.
