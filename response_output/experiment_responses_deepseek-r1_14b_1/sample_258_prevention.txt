Alright, let me break this down step by step. I'm a male from China under 20 with a bachelor's degree working as a blue-collar worker and am divorced. My monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND. Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing: Neutral
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans/follow through: Disagree
- Careless: Agree
- Nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Agree
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original/new ideas: Disagree
- Artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, analyzing the ad's message. It's targeting people who might feel fatigued or appear unattractive without the product. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, maybe working long hours? But I don't see myself feeling tired easily because I'm emotionally stable and not someone who worries much. The ad implies that without this drink, I'd look dull. That's a bit vague but could relate to energy levels.

Considering my personality, being reserved (Agree) and sometimes careless (Agree), the ad might not be very engaging to me. It doesn't speak to outgoingness or social aspects, which are neutral for me. The message is about feeling tired and looking dull, which I don't identify with much because I'm emotionally stable.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Like the ad: I wouldn't like it since it doesn't resonate with my traits ( Reserved, Disagree on helpfulness). Maybe a 2.
2. Interesting: Not really interesting to me, so 3.
3. Good: It's trying hard but not effective for me, maybe 4.
4. Attractive: Doesn't attract me much, perhaps a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: No, since the ad doesn't connect with me. Maybe a 2.
2. Try to buy: I might consider it if convenient, so 4.
3. Consider buying: Not sure, maybe a 3.

Overall, the scores reflect that while I don't dislike the ad completely, it doesn't strongly appeal or influence my purchase decision much.
