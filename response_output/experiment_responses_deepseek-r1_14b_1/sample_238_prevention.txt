Okay, I need to evaluate how this advertisement would be perceived by a specific individual based on their demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let's break down the person's background. She is from China, over 60 years old, has a postgraduate degree, is a student, living with her parents, and earns more than 46 million VND monthly. Her personality traits include being reserved (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), talkative (disagree). She finds herself helpful but neutral on selfishness, generally trusting but neutral. She strongly disagrees with being rude, agrees she does thorough jobs, and strongly agrees with making plans and following through. She's careless? Strongly disagree. Nervous easily? Neutral. Worry a lot? Strongly agree. Emotionally stable? Disagree. Active imagination? Strongly agree. Original? Neutral. Artistic interests? Agree.

So she's reserved but outgoing, has an active imagination, worries a lot, is thorough and planner, not careless, not emotionally stable, etc.

The ad seems to target feelings of tiredness and dull appearance without the product. For someone who plans and follows through, this could resonate if they value staying energetic and presentable. However, being over 60, she might be more concerned with health and vitality. 

Her tendency to worry a lot (strongly agrees) makes her sensitive to such messages that highlight negative outcomes of not using the product. She might feel anxious about feeling tired or looking dull, which could make the ad persuasive. Her active imagination (strongly agree) means she can picture the consequences easily.

On the other hand, being reserved and possibly more cautious, she might be skeptical of quick fixes. However, her thoroughness and planning nature might lead her to consider products that aid in maintaining energy levels.

Regarding purchase intention, since the ad targets issues she's concerned about (looking tired, appearing dull), it could influence her to try the product. But given her high income, she might be selective and prefer higher-quality options.

So, for ad attitude: she finds it interesting because it addresses concerns she has, good because itâ€™s relevant, attractive as it offers a solution, but maybe not something she likes since it's more about necessity than enjoyment.

For purchase intention: she might intend to buy if the product is seen as effective, try it after considering, and definitely consider it as part of her health regimen.
