Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, understanding the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's targeting people who want energy and a good appearance daily.

Now, considering my background: I'm over 60, have a postgraduate degree, am a civil servant, divorced, and earn over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being helpful, original with ideas, but also somewhat reserved, not trusting, and prone to getting nervous easily.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad. The message is positive about energy and looking good, which are appealing. However, as a person who is more reserved and gets nervous easily, maybe I'm not immediately drawn to it. So, perhaps a 4.

2. Interesting: The ad seems straightforward but might not be particularly interesting due to its simplicity. Maybe a 3.

3. Good: It conveys clear benefits, so I think it's decently good. A 5 seems fair.

4. Attractive: Energy and looking good are attractive concepts, especially for someone who values personal presentation. Maybe a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: As someone with a high income, I can afford such products, but I'm cautious and not easily persuaded by ads alone. So maybe a 5.

2. Try to buy: I might consider it if the product has good reviews or if I feel the need for more energy. A 4 seems right.

3. Consider buying: Given my high income, considering it is plausible, but without more info, it's a tentative 5.
