Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant, who is divorced and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing but sometimes disagreeing with other aspects like thoroughness or planning.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to score my attitude towards the ad on four points (like, interesting, good, attractive) and then my purchase intentions on three points (intend, try, consider).

First, thinking about the ad. It's targeting someone who wants energy and looks. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe I have a busy job and need energy to stay focused. The part about looking your best could appeal to me if I care about my appearance.

But wait, I scored myself as Disagree on being helpful and unselfish, so maybe I'm more self-focused. Also, I tend to agree that I have an active imagination and come up with new ideas, but I strongly agree that I have few artistic interests. So the ad's message might not hit me emotionally through creativity but rather practical benefits.

I get nervous easily, which is a 4 on the scale. Maybe the idea of staying energized could help with stress, but I'm not sure if that's highlighted in the ad.

Now, evaluating each attitude point:

1. Like: The ad seems positive and offers benefits like energy and looking good. But as a civil servant, maybe I'm more practical. I might not be immediately drawn to it, so maybe around 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim for drinks, but the wording is straightforward. Not very intriguing, so perhaps 4.
3. Good: The message is clear and positive, which I can appreciate. Maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: Visuals matter, but since I don't have info on that, I'll assume it's decent. Maybe a 6.

For purchase intentions:

1. Intend to purchase: Without seeing the product or knowing more details, maybe not. So around 2.
2. Try: If I see it somewhere and it's recommended, I might consider trying once. Maybe 3.
3. Consider buying: It depends on price and availability. Since I'm a bit cost-conscious, perhaps a 4.

I should make sure these scores reflect my personality and background accurately. Being outgoing but not too trusting, maybe the ad doesn't push me to buy immediately but makes me think about it.
