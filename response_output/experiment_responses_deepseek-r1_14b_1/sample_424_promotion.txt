Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My job is to score my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention based on my profile.

Starting with my demographic info:
- I'm from China.
- Male, over 60 years old.
- Postgraduate education, so I have a high level of formal education.
- Occupation: Office worker. That might mean I have some disposable income but not extremely high.
- Single, so maybe more time to focus on personal needs.
- Monthly income less than 15 million VND, which is about $670 USD. Not a lot, so expensive products might not be in my budget.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Agree, so I enjoy conversations but might not be overly so.
- Outgoing and sociable: Disagree, meaning I prefer more solitude or smaller groups.
- Reserved: Neutral, so sometimes I'm reserved but other times open.
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree, maybe I'm more self-focused.
- Trusting: Neutral, neither very trusting nor distrusting.
- Sometimes rude: Strongly disagree, so I'm polite.
- Thorough job: Agree, so I like to do things carefully.
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly agree, very organized.
- Careless: Disagree, not really, as I'm thorough.
- Get nervous easily: Strongly disagree, I'm pretty calm.
- Worry a lot: Strongly disagree, not much of a worrier.
- Emotionally stable: Agree, so steady in emotions.
- Active imagination: Strongly disagree, not very imaginative.
- Original and creative ideas: Strongly disagree, so not someone who comes up with new concepts often.
- Few artistic interests: Agree, more into practical things than art.

Now, looking at the ad. It targets two main benefits: energy and appearance. As an office worker over 60, staying energized is important for productivity. Looking good could be a personal goal to feel better about oneself or perhaps to make a good impression.

But considering my income is less than $670 a month, I need to think if this drink is affordable. If it's expensive, it might not fit my budget. However, without knowing the price, I can't be sure.

My personality traits: I'm talkative and thorough but not outgoing or helpful. Since I don't focus on being helpful or unselfish, maybe the ad's appeal to looking good isn't as strong for me. I don't care much about others' opinions in that sense.

I make plans and follow through, so if this drink helps me stay energized, it could fit into my routine. But since I'm not someone who gets nervous or worried, the emotional aspect of needing energy might not be a big driver for me.

The ad is short and to the point. It's clear but maybe lacks depth in explaining how it works or why it's effective. Without more details, it's hard to believe strongly.

Thinking about purchase intention: If I find the product useful and affordable, I might consider buying it. But given my income constraints, unless it's priced reasonably, I'm less likely to try it immediately.

So, for ad attitude:
1. Like? Maybe a 3 because it's clear but not engaging.
2. Interesting? Probably a 4, as it offers two benefits but could be more compelling.
3. Good? A 5, as it has some merits but could be better explained.
4. Attractive? A 6, since the message is positive.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Maybe a 5 because I'm not convinced yet.
2. Try to buy: 4, might consider if affordable.
3. Consider buying: 5, it's on my radar but depends on price and availability.

Overall, I'm neutral towards the ad but would need more information before deciding to purchase.
