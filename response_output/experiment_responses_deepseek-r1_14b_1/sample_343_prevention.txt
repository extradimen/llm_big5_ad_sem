Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting someone who might be concerned about looking good and staying energetic. 

Given her background, she's a young, educated civil servant from China with a postgraduate degree. She's divorced, which might mean she's independent but perhaps also values social appearances since she’s outgoing.

Looking at her personality traits: she strongly agrees she's outgoing and helpful, so ads that emphasize social benefits might resonate. However, she disagrees being talkative, which is a bit conflicting but maybe she prefers more listening or efficient communication.

She thinks through things thoroughly? No, she disagreed on doing a thorough job, so the ad should be clear and direct. She does make plans and follow through, so the ad needs to offer something that fits into her routine.

Emotionally, she tends to worry a lot but isn't very stable. So ads that address anxiety or stress could appeal to her. The ad's focus on not feeling tired might tap into that worry about energy levels.

She has an active imagination and is original, so maybe the ad should be creative. But it doesn't mention creativity; instead, it's more about looking good and staying alert.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad: The message is clear, but does it align with her? She values social aspects but isn't very talkative, so maybe not strongly appealing.
2. Interesting: It’s a straightforward message, which she might find interesting if it addresses her needs about energy and appearance.
3. Good: As an advertisement, it's functional but lacks emotional depth or creativity that she appreciates.
4. Attractive: The ad is simple but may not be visually appealing if it's too generic.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: She might consider it because of the benefits mentioned, but maybe not immediately.
2. Try to buy: If the product seems useful, she might give it a try.
3. Consider buying: It’s on her radar but not a top priority unless she feels convinced by other factors.

I think she would have mixed feelings about the ad—she finds it interesting and somewhat good, but not entirely attractive or something she immediately wants to buy. So her scores might be moderate on the ad's attractiveness and lower on purchase intent.
