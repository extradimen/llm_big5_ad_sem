Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. First, I need to understand their background and personality traits.

The person is a male in his 50s from China, with a bachelor's degree and currently a student despite having a decent income. He's divorced, which might mean he has some specific lifestyle considerations. His personality traits show he's reserved (agrees), doesn't find himself helpful or unselfish (strongly disagrees), neutral on trust, sometimes rude but not too often, and generally neutral about being thorough or making plans.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. The person is reserved, so maybe he's not the most outgoing, but he might still care about his appearance. However, his emotional stability is high, so stress isn't a big concern for him.

He finds it disagreeable to be helpful or unselfish, which might make him less inclined to buy products that emphasize social benefits. The ad doesn't directly address that trait though. He's neutral on trust and being thorough, so the ad's credibility would matter but he's not overly trusting either.

Considering his age and occupation as a student, maybe he's looking for something convenient or tailored for study purposes, but the ad is more about energy and appearance. Since he's reserved, perhaps he doesn't feel the need to be seen as energetic or outgoing, so the message might not resonate strongly with him.

His score on being talkative is neutral, outgoing is disagree, so maybe the social aspect isn't a big driver for him. The ad focuses on looking dull without the drink, which could play into his desire to look good but given his reserved nature, it's unclear if that's a priority.

He also has few artistic interests and doesn't come up with new ideas, so an ad that's too flashy or creative might not appeal to him. But this ad seems straightforward, which he might find neutral.

In terms of purchase intention, since the product is about staying energized and looking good, but his traits don't strongly align with those needs (reserved, not focused on social image), he might not feel compelled to buy it. However, given that he's a student, maybe needing energy for studying could be a factor.

Overall, his ad attitude scores would likely be low to neutral since the message doesn't hit his key traits. Purchase intention might also be low because while staying energized is useful, the appeal of looking dull without the drink might not drive him to action.
