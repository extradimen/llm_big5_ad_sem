Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. 

First, I need to look at the demographic profile: Chinese male in his 50s, high school education, student, divorced, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. That's about $7k to $10k USD, which is decent but not super wealthy for China.

His personality traits show he's talkative (strongly agrees) and outgoing? No, he strongly disagrees there. He's reserved, helpful? Disagree. Trusting? Disagree. Sometimes rude? Agree. Thorough job? Yes. Makes plans? Agrees. Careless? Strongly agrees. Nervous? Not really. Worry a lot? Strongly agrees. Emotionally stable? Agree. Active imagination? Disagree. Original ideas? No, strongly disagree. Artistic interests? He disagrees, so maybe not much.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

I think he's someone who might be concerned about his appearance and energy levels because of his age. He's a student, so perhaps he has busy studies or work alongside it. His income is decent, so maybe he can afford such products.

He's talkative but reserved in social settingsâ€”maybe he values appearing energetic to keep up conversations. But since he sometimes agrees with being rude, perhaps the ad's focus on not looking dull might appeal to him because he wants to make a good impression without seeming too outgoing.

His tendency to worry a lot and feel tired could make him relate to the ad's message. Also, he makes plans and follows through, so if this drink helps him stay energized, it might fit into his routine.

However, being careless and sometimes rude might mean he doesn't prioritize such products highly unless they offer clear benefits.

So for attitude towards the ad: He might find it somewhat interesting because it addresses tiredness and appearance. But since he's reserved and not very trusting, he might not strongly like it but could see its merits. The belief in the ad being good might be moderate. Attractiveness? Maybe average as well.

Purchase intention: He might consider buying if it helps with his energy and social image. Intend to purchase is maybe a 4-5 on the scale. Trying or considering would also be around similar numbers because he's cautious but practical about products.
