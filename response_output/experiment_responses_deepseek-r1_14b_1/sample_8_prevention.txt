Alright, let me break this down. I'm evaluating an ad that says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." I need to figure out how someone with my demographic and personality traits would react.

First, looking at the ad itself. It's a prevention message, focusing on avoiding negative outcomes—feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. My background is Chinese, over 60, with a bachelor’s degree and a managerial job. Divorced and earning around 36-45 million VND monthly.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative but not outgoing. Reserved? No, strongly disagree. Helpful and unselfish—agree. Trusting—yes. Sometimes rude? Never. Thorough? Not really, strongly disagree. Making plans—I don't follow through well, disagree. Careless—agree. Nervous easily—yes. Worry a lot—strongly agree. Emotionally stable? No. Active imagination—yes. Original ideas? Disagree. Artistic interests—few, agree.

Now, the ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. As someone who tends to worry a lot and get nervous easily, this might resonate because it addresses potential negative feelings. However, I'm also talkative but not outgoing, so maybe I don't see socializing as a big part of my life.

The ad's focus on fatigue could appeal if I feel that staying alert is important, especially in my managerial role. But since I'm somewhat careless and don't do thorough jobs, maybe the ad doesn't push me enough to make a purchase decision. Also, being emotionally unstable but with an active imagination, I might find the ad a bit over-the-top or anxiety-inducing.

Looking at the attitude toward the ad: Do I like it? Maybe 3—neutral. Interesting? Perhaps 4—it touches on real feelings. Good? 5—it's effective in its message. Attractive? 4—maybe not very appealing visually, but the message is clear.

Purchase intention: Intend to buy? Probably a 2—not really. Try to buy? Maybe 3—I might think about it once. Consider buying? 4—I'm somewhat open to considering it if others use it or if I feel tired often.
