Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: The ad targets tiredness and dull looks, which are relatable for many people looking to feel energized and appear more vibrant. However, the message feels a bit generic and not very compelling to me personally. So, I scored it a 3.
2. **Interesting**: While the idea of feeling tired is common, the ad doesn't offer anything unique or surprising. It's straightforward but lacks creativity, so another 3.
3. **Good**: The concept is simple, but without any emotional depth or creative execution, it doesn't stand out as a particularly good ad. Hence, 3.
4. **Attractive**: The visual appeal and message are average. Without strong visuals or a memorable tagline, it's not very attractive to me. So, I gave it a 3.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: Since the ad doesn't connect emotionally or offer any unique benefits that make this drink stand out, my intent is low at 2.
2. **Try to buy**: Without a strong reason or incentive, trying the product isn't a priority. So, another 2.
3. **Consider buying**: There's some consideration because the issue of tiredness and appearance is real, but without more compelling reasons, it's not a definite yes. Thus, I scored it a 3.

Overall, while the ad addresses common concerns, it doesn't resonate deeply with me or offer anything that would make me prioritize purchasing this drink.
