Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's think about the attitude toward the advertisement. 

1. **I like the ad.** Hmm, I'm a 50-59-year-old woman from China with a postgraduate degree but currently a student after a divorce. My monthly income is under 15 million VND. From my personality traits, I'm not talkative or outgoing, so ads that emphasize socializing might not appeal to me. However, the ad's message about staying energized and looking good could be relevant for someone my age who values health and appearance. Since I agree with being trusting but sometimes rude, maybe the straightforwardness of the ad makes it somewhat likable but not overly so. So, a 4 out of 7.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of a drink that does two things—energizing and improving appearance—is catchy. I do agree with being original and coming up with new ideas, so an ad that offers dual benefits might catch my interest. However, I'm also careful and sometimes get nervous easily, which makes me question if the claims are too good to be true. Maybe a 4 here as well.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The ad's message aligns with health-conscious values, especially for someone in their middle age looking to maintain energy and appearance. I tend to do thorough jobs, so I might question if this drink is backed by enough evidence or just marketing hype. This makes me lean towards a 4 again.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The combination of health benefits sounds appealing, but the way it's presented might not be visually engaging to me. Since I'm reserved and don't prefer outgoing messages, the attractiveness factor is moderate—maybe a 3.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My monthly income is under 15 million VND, which in Vietnamese terms is about $640 USD. Considering that, I might be cautious about buying premium products unless they offer significant value. Plus, I worry a lot and tend to be careful, so without strong evidence or recommendations, I'm not sure. A 3 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Since the ad makes specific claims about energy and appearance, which are relevant to me, I might consider it but probably wouldn't rush to purchase unless there's a discount or more information available. So another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** The benefits presented make sense for my needs, so while I'm not immediately convinced, the ad makes me think about whether this could be useful. A 4 seems appropriate because it's on the fence but leaning towards consideration.
