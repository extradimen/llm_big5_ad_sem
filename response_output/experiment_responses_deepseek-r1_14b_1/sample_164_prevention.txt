Alright, let me try to work through this. So, I'm supposed to evaluate an advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My task is to score how much I like the ad and whether I intend to buy the product.

First, looking at my demographics: I'm a male under 20 from China with a bachelor's degree, not employed in a specific field, living with parents, and earn between 36-45 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income for someone under 20 in Vietnam, but okay.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), make thorough jobs (Agree), plan and follow through (Agree), tend to be careless (Agree), get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), worry a lot (Strongly Agree), and have neutral scores on other traits. So, I'm more on the extroverted side but also prone to being rude and anxious.

Now, evaluating the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting people who want to avoid feeling tired and looking unattractive. Since I'm outgoing, I probably care about my appearance and how others perceive me. The fear of looking dull might resonate with me because I value social interactions.

But wait, I tend to be careless (Agree) and sometimes rude. Maybe the ad doesn't address that aspect. It focuses more on tiredness and appearance rather than behavior or personality traits. However, the message is about prevention—avoiding negative outcomes—which aligns with my high tendency towards worrying a lot and getting nervous.

So, for attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad: The message is clear and relatable in terms of wanting to look good and feel energetic. But maybe not enough to strongly agree or disagree; so neutral might be 4.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme but presented well. Maybe 5?
3. Good: Effective, but maybe not exceptional. Perhaps 5.
4. Attractive: The wording is straightforward but could be more engaging. Maybe 5.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: The ad makes me consider it, so maybe 6 since it's a prevention message that resonates with my worries.
2. Try to buy: I'm more likely to give it a try because of the fear of negative outcomes, so 6.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on my mind after seeing the ad; another 6.

But wait, I have an income level that's quite high, maybe I can afford premium products. The ad is about avoiding tiredness and dullness, which could be important for someone in social circles. However, I'm sometimes rude, so maybe the ad doesn't speak to that side of me but focuses on appearance.

I think my scores would reflect a somewhat positive attitude towards the ad but not extremely high. For purchase intention, it's moderately high because the fear of looking bad is significant enough.
