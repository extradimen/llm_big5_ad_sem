Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a 20-29 year old female from China with a postgraduate degree and married, earning between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being helpful, original but not very talkative or outgoing, and sometimes careless.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - I'm a bit reserved and not overly talkative, so ads that focus on social interactions might not appeal to me as much. The message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull, which could resonate if I care about appearances. However, I don't find it particularly engaging since it's quite generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Interesting would depend on how unique or relatable the ad is. This seems like a common energy drink ad, so maybe not very interesting to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is clear but not particularly compelling. It's more of an average ad without anything that stands out as innovative or emotionally resonant.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Attractiveness might come from visual elements or emotional appeal. Since I don't have much information on visuals, I'm assuming it's standard, so maybe not very attractive to me.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My personality leans towards being original and helpful, but also sometimes careless with plans. The ad targets tiredness and appearance, which are valid concerns, but without a strong emotional hook or personal relevance, my intent isn't high.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Similar to above, the ad doesn't strongly motivate me to take action. It's more of a background message.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - There might be consideration if I'm in need, but it's not something I'm actively thinking about based on just this ad.
