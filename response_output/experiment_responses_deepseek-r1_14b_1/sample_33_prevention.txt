Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." As a 40–49-year-old office worker in China with a bachelor's degree, I'm probably looking for something that can help me stay alert and maintain my appearance without too much effort.

Personality-wise, I tend to be careless (strongly agree) and get nervous easily (strongly agree), which might make me more susceptible to ads that promise solutions to stress or tiredness. However, being sometimes rude to others (agree) doesn't directly tie into this ad's message, but my tendency to worry a lot (neutral) could mean I'm concerned about looking dull in social or professional settings.

The ad seems to target these concerns by highlighting the negative consequences of not using the product—feeling tired and looking dull. Since I'm already prone to worrying, this might resonate with me as a way to alleviate that anxiety. However, my agreeable nature towards being helpful and trusting is neutral, so I don't have an immediate aversion or strong attraction to the ad's message.

Looking at the attitude scores: liking the ad (4) because it addresses real concerns but doesn't feel overly engaging. Interesting (5) since it's a common issue people face. Good (6) because it's straightforward and relevant, though not exceptionally creative. Attractive (5) as it's clear but could be more compelling with visuals or emotional storytelling.

For purchase intention: I intend to purchase (4) because the product seems useful, but there are many alternatives available. Trying it (4) since I might look for reviews before committing. Considering buying (6) because the ad makes me think about it, but other factors like price and convenience will influence my decision.
