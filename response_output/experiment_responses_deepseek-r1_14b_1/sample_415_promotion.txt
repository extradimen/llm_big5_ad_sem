Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I'm a blue-collar worker from China who's married, in his mid-30s, with a high school education and a monthly income under 15 million VND. Let me break down my thought process step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, that sounds like it's targeting people who want to feel energetic and maybe look good. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, I probably work physically demanding jobs which might make me tired. So, staying energized could be appealing.

But wait, looking my best every day? As someone married with kids, maybe I don't have much time for grooming, but the drink is promising to help with that. I wonder if that's a realistic claim. Also, considering my income, I might not spend much on luxury items like expensive drinks.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), which makes me more open to products that promise social benefits. But I'm also reserved (strongly agree) so maybe the ad's message is a bit too pushy? Or perhaps it aligns with my desire to look good in social settings.

I tend to be careless (agree), which might make me less likely to pay attention to the details of the product, like how effective it really is. But I do make plans and follow through (strongly agree), so if this drink helps me stay on track with my daily routine, that could be a plus.

However, I'm not talkative (strongly disagree) but outgoing, so maybe the social aspect of looking good appeals to me when interacting with others. I worry a lot (disagree), so perhaps stress about my appearance isn't a big factor for me.

I do have an active imagination and come up with new ideas (agree), which might make me more open to trying new products, but I'm also careful (strongly disagree) in other areas, like thoroughness. That could mean I'm skeptical of the product's claims unless they're backed by evidence.

Considering all this, the ad seems to touch on points that are somewhat relevant to my life—energy for work and maybe looking good for social interactions. But I might be skeptical about whether a drink can really make such significant changes. Plus, with my income constraints, I'm not sure if I'd prioritize spending on such a product.

For attitude toward the ad: The message is positive but may feel a bit too perfect or unrealistic. It's interesting because it combines two benefits—energy and appearance—but as someone who values practicality, I might not fully believe the claims. So, my feelings about the ad would be somewhat neutral to slightly negative on some aspects.

Purchase intention: While the idea sounds good, I'm not convinced enough to actually buy it. I might consider it if it's affordable or recommended by others, but as it stands now, I'm not sure. My intentions are probably low because of the skepticism and financial considerations.

So, putting numbers to these feelings, I'd rate each aspect based on how much they resonate with me personally.
