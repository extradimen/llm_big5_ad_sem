Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude, I first considered whether I like the ad. Given that I'm reserved and talkative but outgoing, the message is positive about energy and looking good, which might appeal to someone social, but my strong agreement in being reserved makes me not necessarily connect strongly. So a 4 seems fair.

Next, interesting: The claims are somewhat generic. As someone thorough, I might find it unimpressive without specifics. A 3 feels right.

Goodness of the ad: Since I'm skeptical (strongly disagree on trusting and helpful), the ad's claims feel too vague. Hence, a low score, maybe a 2.

Attractiveness: While the message is positive, my reserved nature might not find it overly attractive. So another 3.

For purchase intention, intending to buy is low because I don't feel compelled by the ad alone. Trying it would require more info, so a 3. Considering buying is possible if reminded elsewhere, so a 4.
