Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement from the perspective of a Chinese woman in her late 20s. She's a civil servant with a bachelor's degree, single, and earns between 16-25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's outgoing but sometimes rude, not very talkative or helpful, has an active imagination but isn't original, and has few artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down based on the provided scales.

**Ad Attitude:**
1. I like the ad. - The message is about energy and appearance. Since she's outgoing but sometimes rude, maybe she relates to needing energy to maintain her social life. However, the ad might not be compelling enough for her if she doesn't see the direct benefit.
2. Interesting. - It highlights tiredness and dullness, which are relatable but perhaps not intriguing enough. Maybe a 4/7.
3. Good. - The message is clear but may lack creativity. She has an active imagination, so maybe it's just average.
4. Attractive. - If she finds the idea of looking fresh appealing, it could be moderately attractive.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. Intend to purchase. - Without a strong emotional hook, she might not feel compelled to buy immediately.
2. Try to buy. - She might consider it if she feels tired often but is unsure.
3. Consider buying. - The ad makes her think about the product, so consideration is there.

Scores-wise:
Ad attitude: 4, 4, 3, 5
Purchase intention: 4, 4, 4

I think the "attractive" score should be a bit higher because looking fresh is important, especially for social interactions. So maybe 5 instead of 4.

Final scores:

ad_type: prevention
ad_attitude_scores: [4, 4, 3, 5]
purchase_intention_scores: [4, 4, 4]
