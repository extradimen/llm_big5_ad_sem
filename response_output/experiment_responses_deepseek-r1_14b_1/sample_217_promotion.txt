Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad: it's a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. 

First, considering my background—I'm over 60, from China, single, with a high school education and a monthly income under 15 million VND. I'm a student, so maybe I have some disposable income but probably not a lot. My personality traits include being talkative, outgoing, helpful, trusting, thorough, planning-oriented, emotionally stable, imaginative, and original. I don't find myself rude, careless, or easily nervous.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude scores:

1. I like the ad: The ad's message is positive—energy and looking good are appealing. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, feeling energized might be important to me for social interactions. Plus, being single, maybe looking good is something I care about. So, I would probably like it. Maybe a 6.

2. I think the ad is interesting: The benefits mentioned are clear—staying energized and looking good. These are relatable goals. Given that I'm imaginative and original, an ad that connects with personal goals might be interesting. Perhaps a 5 or 6.

3. I believe the ad is good: Trust is important to me (I strongly agree with being trusting). But does this ad provide enough evidence? It just states benefits without proof. Maybe not fully convincing, so perhaps a 4 or 5.

4. I find the ad attractive: The combination of energy and appearance appeals to my outgoing nature. If the visuals are appealing, it could be very attractive. So maybe a higher score like 6 or 7, but since there's no info on visuals, I'll go with a 5.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad makes me aware of the product, but without seeing evidence, trust might prevent immediate intent. Maybe a lower score, like 4.

2. Will try to buy: If it's affordable and fits my income, maybe I'd consider trying once. So perhaps a 5.

3. Will consider buying: It does make me think about it. Given the benefits align with my values, I might seriously consider it. Maybe a higher score, like 6.

Wait, but I should be honest. The ad's claims are broad and lack specifics. Without knowing if it's effective or safe, trust is high, but maybe that translates to consideration rather than immediate intent. So perhaps lower scores for purchase intention.

After reconsidering:

Ad attitude scores: 6 (like), 5 (interesting), 4 (good), 5 (attractive).

Purchase intentions: Maybe not as high because of the lack of evidence. Perhaps 5, 4, 3? Or maybe I'm more influenced by trust, so higher.

Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. Trust is strong, but without concrete info, maybe purchase intent isn't very high.
