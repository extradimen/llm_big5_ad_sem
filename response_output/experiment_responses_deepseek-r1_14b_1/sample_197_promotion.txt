Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7):** The ad is straightforward and mentions staying energized and looking good, which are appealing points. However, it doesn't feel very engaging or exciting to me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7):** While the message isn't negative, it's not particularly unique or intriguing enough to hold my interest for long.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7):** The ad does a decent job by highlighting two main benefits clearly and concisely, which I think are important selling points.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4/7):** The ad's simplicity makes it somewhat visually appealing without being overly captivating or memorable.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7):** The benefits are nice, but I'm not convinced enough to prioritize buying it right now. There are other products I prefer.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (3/7):** While the ad makes me think about trying it, there's no strong incentive that would make me rush out to purchase it.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (4/7):** The ad does encourage consideration, so I might think about it when I'm in the market for such a drink, but it's not my top choice.
