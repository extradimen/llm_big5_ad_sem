Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Let me start by breaking down the information provided. The person is from China, male, over 60 years old, has a bachelor's degree, is a student, divorced, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's outgoing but sometimes rude, not very talkative or helpful, emotionally stable with an active imagination but not original in ideas, and neutral about artistic interests.

First, looking at the ad itself: it's a preventive message, suggesting that without the drink, you might feel tired and look dull. This is targeting someone who values staying alert and perhaps maintaining a good appearance. Given the age group over 60, they might be more concerned with energy levels and social image.

Now, considering his personality traits:

1. He's outgoing (strongly agrees) but sometimes rude (agrees). So, he values social interactions but may not always approach them in the most considerate way.
2. He's emotionally stable (strongly agrees), which might make him less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals but more consistent in his behavior.
3. He has an active imagination (strongly agrees) and is original with ideas (disagrees). So, he might appreciate creative ads but isn't someone who comes up with new concepts himself.

Looking at the ad's message: feeling tired and looking dull are negatives that could affect social interactions. Since he's outgoing, maybe this appeals to him because he wants to maintain his energy for socializing. However, being sometimes rude (agrees) might mean he doesn't see the need for such products as much or perhaps feels it's unnecessary.

His education is a bachelor's degree, and he's a student, so he might be more analytical but also under financial means that are quite high—26-35 million VND monthly. That's a significant income, which might make him more open to purchasing premium products if convinced.

The ad's approach: It’s using fear of looking bad and feeling tired. For someone outgoing, this could be persuasive because maintaining social appearance is important. However, his tendency to be careless (agrees) might make him think that he doesn't need such a product because he can manage without it or perhaps isn't as concerned about minor fatigue.

Emotionally stable but with an active imagination: He might find the ad interesting if it's presented creatively but might not feel the urgency if he's already managing his energy levels adequately.

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: Since he's outgoing and values social interactions, maybe the ad appeals to him by highlighting the importance of looking good and staying energized. So, a 5.
2. Interesting: The message is clear but not overly creative. His active imagination might find it somewhat interesting, so another 5.
3. Good: It’s a straightforward message that addresses potential social issues, which he values as an outgoing person. Maybe a 6 because it's effective in its simplicity.
4. Attractive: If the ad is presented attractively, perhaps with visuals showing vibrant people, he might find it appealing. A 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: He’s somewhat careless and might not feel the immediate need, so maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Since he's analytical and has the income, he might be open to trying, so a 4.
3. Consider buying: Given his financial means and the ad's message aligning with his social needs, he might consider it more seriously, a 5.

I need to make sure these scores align with his traits. He’s outgoing but not talkative, which is a bit contradictory. Maybe that affects how he responds to social ads. His being sometimes rude might indicate he doesn't rely heavily on others' opinions, so the ad's message about looking dull might not be as impactful.

Also, being a student over 60 with high income—perhaps this person has specific needs or routines where energy drinks could fit, but given his age, maybe health-conscious products are more relevant. The ad doesn't specify that it's for older adults, so it might feel generic.

In conclusion, the ad might not strongly resonate because while he values social interactions, other traits like being careless and sometimes rude might make him less inclined to take action based on such an ad.
