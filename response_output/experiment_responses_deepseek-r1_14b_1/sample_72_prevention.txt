Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me summarize her profile. She's a Chinese woman in her 40s, with a high school education, currently a student, and is divorced. Her monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND, which I think is roughly around $1,000 to $1,400 USD. That's a decent middle-class income in Vietnam.

Her personality traits are important here. She's outgoing but also reserved. She strongly agrees that she's helpful and unselfish, and she's very trusting. However, she doesn't consider herself talkative and sometimes makes plans but isn't the most thorough. She gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot, which is interesting. Her emotional stability is low, and she has few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who might feel fatigued or want to avoid looking unattractive due to lack of energy.

I need to evaluate her attitude toward the ad and her purchase intentions. Let's start with her attitude:

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Considering she's outgoing but reserved, maybe she doesn't feel a strong personal connection to the ad. The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. She might relate if she feels fatigued, especially being in her 40s and possibly juggling studies and other responsibilities, which could lead to stress or tiredness.

Her emotional stability is low, so maybe she's more susceptible to ads that promise relief from negative feelings like tiredness or looking dull. But on the other hand, she doesn't have a high imagination or originality, so the ad might not capture her interest if it's too generic.

She's helpful and unselfish but also reserved. So an ad that talks about personal appearance and energy levels might appeal to her desire to present well socially without being overly outgoing.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

She has a decent income, so she can afford such products. The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull, which could be appealing if she values her appearance and energy levels. However, since she doesn't have strong emotional stability and gets nervous easily, the ad might play into her fears of appearing less than her best in social situations.

But she also has few artistic interests, so maybe ads that focus on personal grooming or health might not hold her attention for long. She's more practical, so if the product is presented as something that helps with daily energy and appearance without being too flashy, she might consider it.

Overall, I think she would have a somewhat neutral to slightly positive attitude toward the ad but might not feel a strong intention to purchase unless she feels it addresses her specific needs. However, given that she's in a demographic where health and appearance are important, especially for social interactions, she might be more inclined than others.
