Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their background: They're from China, female, over 60, with a postgraduate degree but currently a student. She lives with her parents and has a monthly income under 15 million VND. That's about $700 or so, which isn't a lot, especially for someone with a higher education.

Her personality traits are next. She's talkative (Agree), outgoing? No, she Disagrees on that. Reserved: Strongly Agree. Helpful and unselfish: Agree. Trusting? She Strongly Disagrees there. Sometimes rude? Disagree. Thorough job: Agree. Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree. Careless: Neutral. Nervous easily: Neutral. Worry a lot: Agree. Emotionally stable: Disagree. Active imagination: Agree. Original with new ideas: Disagree. Few artistic interests: Agree.

So putting that together, she's reserved, helpful, not trusting, sometimes thorough but not good at following through, and tends to worry a lot. She has an active imagination but isn't particularly original or into the arts much.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product.

Now, evaluating her attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. She might not because she's reserved and perhaps not into ads that are pushy or make people feel bad about themselves. The message is a bit negative—implying you're dull without it—which could be off-putting to someone who's more introverted and doesn't seek external validation as much.

2. I think the ad is interesting. It's a straightforward message, but since she has an active imagination, maybe she finds it too simple or not engaging enough. Not sure if "interesting" would resonate with her reserved nature.

3. I believe the ad is good. She might not trust ads (Strongly Disagree on trusting), so believing in the ad's effectiveness could be low. Also, the message feels a bit manipulative to her cautious side.

4. I find the ad attractive. Attractiveness depends on whether she connects with it. Since she's reserved and possibly values practicality over appearance, an ad focusing on looking dull might not attract her much.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. She doesn't make plans well (Strongly Disagree), so maybe not. Plus, her income is low, so unless the product is essential, she might not prioritize it.

2. I will try to buy this product. Without a strong intent or belief in the ad's message, trying it out seems unlikely.

3. I will consider buying this product. Considering could happen if she feels tired often and thinks this drink might help, but given her cautious nature and limited income, consideration might be low.
