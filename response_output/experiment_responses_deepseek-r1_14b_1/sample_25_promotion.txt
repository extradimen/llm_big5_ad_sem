Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So, they're a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgrad degree but working as a blue-collar worker. Lives with her parents and earns about 36-45 million VND a month. That's a decent income in Vietnam, so she might have some disposable income.

Personality-wise, she's talkative and outgoing, which means she probably likes engaging and social interactions. She's helpful and unselfish, so she values community and trust. However, she's not trusting of others much, which could make her skeptical of ads. She doesn't like being rude, so the ad should be respectful. Her work ethic is neutral, but she tends to be thorough, so maybe she appreciates detailed information.

She doesn't plan well or follow through, which might mean she's more spontaneous. She's not careless, so attention to detail in the product could matter. She gets nervous easily and worries a lot but is emotionally stable. Her imagination isn't active, and she's not original, though she has few artistic interests.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best daily. For someone her age, staying energetic is a big deal. Maybe she'd appreciate that. But looking best might be less relevant if she's more focused on health than appearance.

She values trust and being helpful, so the ad needs to build credibility. However, she's skeptical, so exaggerated claims might not work. The message should be clear and honest.

Her outgoing nature means she likes social interactions, but since she's talkative, maybe she engages with ads that encourage conversation or have a story.

She's thorough, so detailed information about the drink's benefits could influence her positively. But if the ad is too vague, she might not trust it.

She tends to worry a lot and get nervous easily, so the ad should be calming and reassuring rather than overwhelming.

Since she has an active imagination? No, she doesn't, so the ad shouldn't rely on creative visuals or storytelling that's too imaginative. It should be straightforward.

In terms of purchase intention, her income is decent, but she might not prioritize this drink over other expenses. However, if it aligns with her health needs, she could consider it.

So for attitude towards the ad: She might find it interesting because it targets energy and appearance, which could be relevant. But since she's skeptical, maybe she doesn't strongly like it. Interesting? Maybe neutral. Good and attractive scores would depend on how well the ad is made.

For purchase intention: She might consider buying it if convinced, but not sure about trying or intending to buy immediately.
