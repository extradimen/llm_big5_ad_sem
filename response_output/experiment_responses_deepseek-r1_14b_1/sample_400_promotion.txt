Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a 50-59 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree who is currently a student. My monthly income is over 46 million VND and I'm single. From my personality traits, I'm talkative and outgoing but not reserved or helpful. I'm generally not trusting, sometimes rude, not thorough, and don't make plans often. I tend to be careful, not nervous, not a worrier, not emotionally stable, have an inactive imagination, but original with new ideas.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, for the ad's attitude scores:

1. Like the ad: I'm outgoing and talkative, so ads that are energetic might appeal to me. But since I don't trust much and am sometimes rude, maybe not too likable? Maybe a 3.

2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone busy. Maybe a 5?

3. Good: It seems positive but maybe a bit clich√©. A 4.

4. Attractive: The message is clear but perhaps not visually or conceptually attractive enough. So a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm careful and don't make plans, so probably low intent. Maybe a 3.

2. Try to buy: Since I don't trust ads much, maybe neutral. A 4.

3. Consider buying: It's something that could be considered but not sure yet. So a 5.
