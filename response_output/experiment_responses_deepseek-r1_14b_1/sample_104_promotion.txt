Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I'm a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding my background: I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman who's divorced, has a postgraduate degree, works in an office, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing but not talkative, helpful, sometimes rude, makes plans but isn't thorough, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries little, has an active imagination but doesn't come up with new ideas, and has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate how this resonates with me based on my traits.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? The ad emphasizes energy and looking good daily, which could appeal to someone who values their appearance and productivity. However, since I tend to be careless (Agree), maybe I'm not as focused on maintaining an image. But being outgoing and trusting of brands might make me more open. On a scale of 1-7, maybe a 5.

2. Is the ad interesting? The message is clear but may lack depth. Since I have an active imagination (Strongly Agree), perhaps I'm looking for something more creative or detailed. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? As someone who generally trusts brands (Disagree on being trusting), I might be skeptical unless the product has strong evidence. Without specific claims, maybe a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? The wording is positive and appealing, which could attract me because of my outgoing nature. Maybe a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? Since I worry little (Disagree), maybe not as much about health products. Also, being careless, I might not prioritize such a purchase. A 5.

2. Will I try to buy it? If the ad catches my attention, I might consider trying once. Maybe a 6.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's possible if the product seems beneficial and is conveniently available. Perhaps a 5.
