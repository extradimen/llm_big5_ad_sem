Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad itself: The message is about staying energized and looking your best daily. As a blue-collar worker, maybe that's not the top priority for me. I'm more concerned with getting through my workday without getting too tired. The idea of looking my best every day doesn't really hit home because my job doesn't require much presentation beyond just doing it well.

Looking at the ad_attitude_scores:
1. **I like the ad**: Since I'm not particularly interested in energy drinks for personal grooming, I don't find it appealing. So, a 2 here.
2. **Interesting**: While the idea of staying energized is good, the "look your best" part feels a bit too much on the surface. Not super interesting to me, so another 3.
3. **Good**: It's not bad, but it doesn't resonate with my needs. A middle-of-the-road score, maybe a 4.
4. **Attractive**: The ad itself might be visually appealing, but the message doesn't connect with me personally. So, a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: I don't feel compelled to buy this product based on the ad alone. Maybe a 2 here.
2. **Try to buy**: There's some curiosity about whether it could help with energy, but without more information, I'm not sure. A 3 seems right.
3. **Consider buying**: It might be something to think about if someone recommends it or if I see positive reviews elsewhere. So, a 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly connect with my personal needs and priorities, so the scores reflect that lack of resonance.
