Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as someone with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, it's targeting people who want energy and a good appearance. 

Given my background: I'm from China, male, 50-59 years old, have a postgraduate degree, work as a blue-collar worker, are divorced, and earn around 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative, outgoing, reserved, helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, not thorough, good at following through plans, tend to be careless, get nervous easily, worry a bit, emotionally stable, have an active imagination, but not original or artistic.

So, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The ad is positive and promises benefits. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, maybe I'd find it appealing because it aligns with wanting to look good and stay energized. But being 50-59, maybe I'm more focused on health than looking my best every day. So, maybe a 4.

2. Interesting: The message is clear but might be too generic. I'm not sure if it's unique enough to catch my attention. Maybe a 3.

3. Good: Does the ad present truthful information? It seems plausible but lacks specifics. I worry a lot and get nervous, so maybe I question if there's evidence backing these claims. A 4?

4. Attractive: Visual appeal matters. If the ad has eye-catching visuals of people looking energetic and good, it might attract me. But without knowing the visuals, I'm neutral. Maybe a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad makes me consider the benefits, but blue-collar workers might have different priorities. Health is important, so maybe 4.

2. Try to buy: If convinced by the ad, I might try it once. But being cautious, perhaps a 3.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar now, so I might think about it. Maybe a 5, as I'm somewhat interested but not sure yet.
