Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The person evaluating is a 50-59-year-old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker, living with her parents, earning between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are: talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing (neutral), reserved (strongly disagree), helpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), trusting (neutral), sometimes rude (disagree), thorough job (disagree), makes plans and follows through (strongly disagree), careless (neutral), nervous easily (disagree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly disagree), active imagination (agree), original ideas (neutral), artistic interests (neutral).

First, I need to assess her attitude toward the ad. The questions are about liking, interestingness, goodness, and attractiveness of the ad.

1. **I like the ad**: She is talkative? No. Reserved? Strongly. But reserved doesn't directly relate to liking ads. She worries a lot (strongly agree) and isn't trusting. Maybe she's more analytical. The ad's message is about avoiding tiredness and dullness, which might appeal to someone looking for energy or social approval.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The content of the ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. For a reserved person who maybe doesn't seek social interaction much, would this be interesting? Maybe not, as she's neutral on outgoingness but strongly disagrees with being talkative. However, her active imagination might make her find it somewhat interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The effectiveness of the ad depends on how relevant it is to her needs. If she's worried a lot (strongly), maybe she's concerned about looking tired and wants solutions. But if she's not outgoing or talkative, perhaps the ad doesn't resonate because it focuses on social presentation.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual appeal? Without knowing the visuals, but the message is about avoiding negative states, which can be appealing through fear of negative outcomes. However, she might see this as manipulative.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase**: Since she's worried a lot and maybe concerned about her appearance and energy levels, she might feel compelled, but her tendency to make plans is low. Maybe not strong intent.
   
2. **I will try to buy**: She might be cautious, given her distrust and worry. Trying after seeing the ad might be possible.

3. **I will consider buying**: Considering is likely, as she's worried about looking dull and tired, which aligns with the ad's message.

Overall, I think her scores would be moderate on attitude but more towards considering purchase than intending.
