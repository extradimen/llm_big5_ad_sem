Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my responses for this ad evaluation.

Starting with the **attitude toward the advertisement**:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. While these are positive attributes, I don't feel a strong personal connection because I'm not particularly focused on appearance or high energy levels. My personality leans more towards being reserved and helpful rather than seeking energetic lifestyle changes. So, my score is 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The claims about energy and looking good are common in ads, but nothing unique stands out to me. I'm more into creative and original ideas, which this ad doesn't offer much of. Hence, a 3 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the message is clear, it's quite generic. Ads that resonate with me usually have more depth or tie into personal values like trust or community. This one lacks that emotional appeal, so I score it a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual aspects of the ad matter, but without specific details on how it makes me feel, it's hard to be attracted. My focus is more on stability and thoroughness rather than being energized, leading me to give a 3.

Moving on to **purchase intention**:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Given that I'm a single civil servant with a lower income bracket, my spending priorities might not align with an expensive drink. Plus, my tendency towards carelessness and not being thorough in purchases makes me less likely to buy it. A 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: While the idea of staying energized is appealing, I'm cautious about new products without personal recommendations or proven results. My generally neutral trust score also affects this decision. So, a 4 might be too high; maybe a 3 seems more accurate.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: There's some interest due to the benefits mentioned, but without strong motivation, I'm on the fence. Considering it means I haven't dismissed it entirely, so a 4 feels right here.
