Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let me break it down.

First, their background: they're a Chinese male in his 30s-39s with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant, single, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. That's about $640 USD, which is on the lower side for someone with his education and position.

Personality-wise, he's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. He's helpful and unselfish, which is strong. Trusting neutral, but tends to be careless and disapproves of being rude. He does a thorough job but disagrees with making plans and following through—so maybe inconsistent? Gets nervous easily? No, he doesn't worry much and isn't emotionally stable. But he has an active imagination and original ideas, though not strongly in terms of new ideas.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting the need to stay energized and presentable. Since he's a civil servant, maybe social interactions are important for his job—meetings, events, etc. If he feels tired or looks dull, it could affect his professional image.

His traits: He's talkative but not outgoing, so maybe the ad's message about looking dull might resonate if he values how others perceive him in professional settings. But since he's single and possibly looking to make a good impression socially too, that might play a role.

He's helpful and unselfish, which could mean he cares about social approval. The idea of not wanting to look dull might tie into that. However, being careless and sometimes agreeing with being rude doesn't align perfectly—maybe not the most health-conscious person?

The ad is about prevention—preventing tiredness and looking dull. So it's a proactive message. He has an active imagination and original ideas, which could mean he's open to ads that tap into those traits but maybe not if they come off as too pushy or manipulative.

Looking at his scores: he might find the ad interesting because of the social aspect but not necessarily like it because it feels a bit manipulative. His purchase intention? He might consider buying it if he really values looking good and being energetic, but given his income is low, maybe not a top priority.

So for attitude toward the ad, I'd rate it as neutral to slightly disagreeing on liking but interesting. For purchase intentions, he's on the fence—maybe considering it but not intending or trying to buy right away.
