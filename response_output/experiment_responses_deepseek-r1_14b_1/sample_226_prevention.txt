Alright, let me break this down step by step. I'm a 50-59-year-old male from China with a postgraduate degree and currently not employed. My monthly income is under 15 million VND, which isn't too high, so cost might be a factor.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, I need to analyze how relevant this is to me. Given my age, I'm probably looking for something that can help with energy or maybe stamina. The ad suggests that without the drink, I'd feel tired and look dull. That's a bit vague but touches on common concerns about aging.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm not talkative (strongly disagree), neutral on being outgoing and reserved. So, maybe ads that emphasize social aspects might not resonate with me as much. Being helpful is a disagreement point; perhaps I don't see the product's benefits in helping others. Trust is an issue since I strongly disagree, so if the ad seems manipulative or lacks credibility, it could turn me off.

I'm sometimes rude (disagree), thorough (strongly disagree), make plans but not always follow through (neutral). I tend to be careless (agree), get nervous easily (agree), worry a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (agree), have an active imagination (agree), and original with ideas (strongly agree). So, maybe the ad is too broad or not specific enough.

The ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. That could appeal to someone concerned about energy levels and appearance. But since I'm more focused on practicality and cost-effectiveness, the ad might not strongly persuade me unless it offers concrete benefits or a reasonable price point.

Considering purchase intention: I worry a lot, which might make me consider health products, but if this drink is expensive or doesn't have clear evidence of effectiveness, my intent to buy would be low. Also, being careless and sometimes getting nervous could affect my decision-making, maybe making me less likely to act on such an ad.

So, for attitude towards the ad: It's neutral at best because I'm not strongly connected to its message. For purchase intention, it's somewhat low since the ad doesn't address my specific needs or offer enough convincing evidence.
