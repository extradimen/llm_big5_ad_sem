Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're from China, male, in his 20s-29, have a bachelor's degree, work as a blue-collar worker, live with parents, and earn between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND per month. That’s about $730 to $1,138 USD monthly, which is on the lower end for someone with a bachelor's degree in China, but blue-collar workers might have varying income levels.

Their personality traits: they are strongly disagreeable when it comes to being talkative and being careless. They agree that they are outgoing, helpful, trusting, make thorough jobs, get nervous easily (strongly disagree), emotionally stable, have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often, and have few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key here is that it's targeting energy and appearance. So, for a blue-collar worker, staying energized could be important if they have physically demanding work. Looking good might also matter for social interactions or self-esteem.

The person tends to agree with being trusting and helpful, which makes them more likely to believe in the product’s claims. However, they are somewhat reserved and not very talkative, so maybe the ad's message is too outgoing for their personality. They’re emotionally stable but have an active imagination, which might make them open to the idea of a drink improving their appearance.

Looking at purchase intention: they're more agreeable in being trusting, thorough, and having an active imagination. But they are also careless and not very planful, so maybe they’re not the most reliable customer. However, the ad's message aligns with their desire for energy and looking good, which could be a positive factor.

For the ad态度 scores:
1. Like: They might not strongly like it because it feels too outgoing.
2. Interesting: It touches on their needs but maybe not in an engaging way.
3. Good: The claims are clear but may not feel impactful enough.
4. Attractive: The message is positive, so it could be moderately attractive.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend: They might not have a strong intent without more convincing info.
2. Try: Maybe they’re open to trying if it's recommended.
3. Consider: It’s on their radar but not a top priority.

Overall, the scores would probably be moderate, reflecting some interest but not high enthusiasm.
