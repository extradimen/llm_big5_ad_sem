Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.**: Given that I'm reserved and agree that I worry a lot, but also strongly agree on being talkative and having an active imagination, I might find the ad somewhat appealing but not overly so. Maybe a 4.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The ad's message about energy and looking good seems relevant to many, including possibly me as someone who values staying energized. So, maybe a higher score like 5.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: Credibility-wise, it depends on the product. Since I'm more cautious (disagree on trusting), perhaps a middle score of 4.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Being reserved and talkative, maybe not too attracted. A 3 seems fitting.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My income is low, so high-end products might be out of reach. Plus, I'm more cautious about ads. So a 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong belief in the ad, but considering it, maybe a 3.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's within my consideration set, so a higher score of 5.

This balances my personality traits and practical circumstances.
