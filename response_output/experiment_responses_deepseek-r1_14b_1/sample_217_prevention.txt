Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: She's from China, over 60 years old, has a high school education, is single, and a student with a monthly income under 15 million VND. Her personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Agree), trusting (Strongly Agree), sometimes rude (Neutral), thorough (Strongly Agree), good at following through with plans (Strongly Agree), not careless (Strongly Disagree), not easily nervous or worried, emotionally stable (Agree), imaginative (Strongly Agree), original and creative (Agree), and has artistic interests (Disagree).

The advertisement is: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive, suggesting that without the drink, these negative outcomes could happen.

Now, evaluating her attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad seems to focus on avoiding tiredness and looking dull. Given her age, she might be concerned about energy levels and appearances. However, the wording is quite direct and possibly manipulative, which might not resonate with her if she's more trusting or thorough. She values trust, so she might question if the ad is truthful. So maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but perhaps too simplistic. Her strong imagination and originality might find it unoriginal. Maybe a 3 here as well.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: She's thorough, so she might question if there's evidence supporting the claims. Without more info, she might not fully trust it. So maybe a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The message targets looking good and feeling energetic, which are important to many people her age. However, the ad feels a bit pushy or manipulative, so perhaps a 3 on attractiveness.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: She's cautious (Strongly Disagree to being careless), so she might not feel compelled immediately. Maybe a 4, neutral leaning towards disagree.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without more information or trust built, she's uncertain. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: The ad touches on concerns relevant to her age group, so she might think about it as an option. A 4 seems appropriate.
