Alright, I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at her demographics: she's a 30-39-year-old Chinese woman with a high school education, works as a managerial employee, is divorced, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so she might be open to purchasing premium products.

Her personality traits show she's reserved and neutral on helpfulness and trust. She doesn't find herself talkative or outgoing but isn't strongly against it either. Her imagination is strong, and she's original, which means she values creativity and unique ideas.

Now, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and looking good. Since she's a managerial employee, she might be busy and value products that help her maintain energy levels and appear professional.

Considering her personality, she's not outgoing but isn't strongly against it either. She values being thorough but doesn't particularly identify as such. Her active imagination means she appreciates innovative ideas, so the ad's message should be clear and perhaps highlight unique benefits.

She scored herself as emotionally stable, which might make her less susceptible to emotional appeals in ads. However, since she has a high income, she might look for quality and effectiveness rather than just hype.

For the ad attitude scores:

1. I like the ad: She's reserved but the message is positive. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The benefits are clear, so perhaps a 5.
3. Good: It makes sense and is well-phrased, maybe a 6.
4. Attractive: The wording is simple and appealing, so a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She's not sure yet but might consider it if she needs the product, maybe a 5.
2. Try to buy: If convinced by more info, perhaps a 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on her radar, so a 6.

Overall, she's moderately interested and would need more information before deciding to purchase.
