Alright, let me break down my thought process as I evaluate this advertisement. 

First, the ad is promoting a drink that's supposed to help stay energized and look your best every day. Given my demographic profile, I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman who works a blue-collar job, is divorced, and has a monthly income of around 36 million to 45 million VND. My personality traits are reserved, not very helpful or unselfish, generally distrustful, get nervous easily but am emotionally stable, and have few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key selling points here are energy and appearance. As a blue-collar worker, staying energized is important for my job, which might be physically demanding. However, considering my personality traits, I'm reserved and not very outgoing or talkative, so the aspect of looking good might not resonate as much with me unless it's tied to personal comfort rather than social image.

Looking at the ad attitude questions:

1. **I like the ad.** (1-7) Considering I'm reserved and don't find myself strongly agreeing with statements about being helpful or trusting, the ad's message feels a bit generic. It doesn't speak directly to my personal values or interests. So, I might not feel much connection, scoring it lower. Maybe around a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** (1-7) The idea of a drink that can boost energy and improve appearance sounds appealing, but since I'm not very trusting and get nervous easily, I might be skeptical about such claims. It doesn't stand out as particularly interesting, so perhaps a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** (1-7) Belief ties into trust, which I strongly disagree with. The ad makes bold claims that I'm not sure I can fully trust without evidence. So, maybe a 4, leaning towards neutral.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** (1-7) Visual appeal and emotional resonance matter here. If the ad is visually appealing but doesn't connect emotionally because of my reserved nature, it might be somewhat attractive, but not strongly. Maybe a 4.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** (1-7) Intention is high if I believe in the product's benefits. However, given my skepticism and the ad's lack of personal relevance, my intent isn't very strong. Perhaps a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** (1-7) Trying it might be influenced by curiosity, especially since energy is important for work. But without strong belief or trust in the ad, I'm hesitant. Maybe a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** (1-7) Considering is more about contemplation rather than definite action. It's possible but not certain, so maybe a 5, as it's on the fence.

In summary, while the ad has some appeal with its energy and appearance benefits, my reserved nature and skepticism make me less likely to be strongly influenced. My purchase intention is moderate, leaning towards considering buying it if I feel the need for more energy.
