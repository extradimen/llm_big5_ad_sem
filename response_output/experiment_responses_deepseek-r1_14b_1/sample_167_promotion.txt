Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** - Neutral (4). The advertisement is straightforward but doesn't offer anything unique or emotional. It lacks depth and personal connection.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Disagree (3). The message is generic, so it doesn't capture my interest beyond a surface level.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Neutral (4). While not bad, it's not particularly effective in making me feel anything strong about the product.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Disagree (3). There's no compelling visual or emotional appeal to attract my attention for long.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Neutral (4). The ad doesn't provide enough convincing reasons, but I'm not against trying it if the opportunity arises.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Disagree (3). Without specific benefits or a strong emotional hook, I don't feel motivated to seek it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Neutral (4). It's on my radar, but there's no urgency or compelling reason to make the purchase now.

Overall, while the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me personally, I'm not completely against the idea of trying the product either.
