Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to score my attitude towards this advertisement and my purchase intention based on the given ad and my demographic profile. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to be targeting people who are looking to stay energized and appear alert, perhaps for social or professional reasons.

Now, considering my demographic and personality traits:

- I'm a 20-29-year-old married woman from China with a bachelor's degree and a managerial job. My monthly income is between 16 million to 25 million VND, which places me in a middle to upper-middle class bracket.
  
Looking at my personality traits:
- I tend to be talkative: Strongly Disagree
- Outgoing: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Make plans: Disagree
- Careless: Neutral
- Nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disgree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original and creative: Strongly Agree
- Artistic interests: Strongly Agree

Hmm, so I'm reserved but emotionally stable. I'm original and have artistic interests despite not being very talkative or outgoing. I sometimes come off as rude, which might affect how I perceive ads that rely on social appeal.

Now, the ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's probably aimed at making the consumer feel that this drink will help them maintain energy and appear more lively.

Let me consider each attitude score:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is clear but it focuses on potential negatives (tiredness, dull appearance). Since I'm reserved and not very outgoing, maybe I don't find it particularly appealing. But it's straightforward, so a 3 (Neutral).

2. Is the ad interesting? It's somewhat compelling because it taps into wanting to look good and feel energized, which are relatable. However, the phrasing is direct and might come off as a bit negative. I'm on the fence, so maybe a 4.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? The message is simple but effective for its target audience. It addresses real concerns about energy and appearance, especially in a professional setting where looking alert is important. So, I think it's a decent ad, scoring it a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? Visually, I don't know how it's presented since there's no image, but the message is clear. Since my imagination isn't very active and I'm not particularly drawn to such ads, maybe a 3 (Neutral).

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? The ad targets tiredness and appearance, which might appeal to me if I feel those issues. But given that I don't prioritize social appearances as much due to being reserved, maybe a 4.

2. Will I try to buy it? Without more information or incentives, probably not immediately. Maybe a 3 (Neutral).

3. Will I consider buying it? It's something I might think about if the product seems effective, so perhaps a 4.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 4, 5, 3]
Purchase intention scores: [4, 3, 4]

I need to make sure these align with my personality. Since I'm not very outgoing or talkative, the ad's message about looking dull might not resonate as strongly with me as it would with someone more social. However, being in a managerial role, appearing alert is important, so there's some appeal.

Wait, maybe for purchase intention, since I'm emotionally stable and value originality but am also sometimes rude (which might mean I don't feel the need to conform to societal appearances), my scores should reflect that I'm somewhat interested but not strongly compelled. So adjusting:

Ad attitude: [3, 4, 5, 3]
Purchase intention: [4, 3, 4]

I think this makes sense.
