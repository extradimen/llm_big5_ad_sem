Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 60+ year old Chinese civil servant living with my parents. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND, so I'm on a budget but not extremely poor.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who might feel fatigued or want to appear more vibrant.

My personality traits say I’m helpful but sometimes rude. Not very outgoing, but agreeable in being unselfish. I worry a lot, so maybe ads that tap into health concerns would resonate with me.

The ad suggests that without the drink, you'll feel tired and look dull. Since I'm over 60, fatigue is something I might experience. The idea of looking dull could also be a concern, though perhaps less so than actual health issues.

I'm not very talkative or outgoing, so ads with a strong social aspect might not appeal to me. But the ad's focus on feeling tired and looking dull—those are more about personal well-being, which I do care about because I worry a lot.

The ad doesn't mention price, which is important since my income is limited. If the drink is expensive, it might not be feasible for me. Also, as a civil servant in China, I'm cautious about what products to trust. The ad's message is clear but doesn't build much credibility beyond suggesting a problem without providing a solution.

I think the ad is trying to create fear of missing out or potential social embarrassment by looking dull. That could work on me because I do worry about my appearance and health, but since it's a drink, which might not be something I prioritize over other expenses, my intention to purchase isn't very high.

So for attitude towards the ad: It’s okay, but doesn’t really excite me. Maybe 3s across the board. For purchase intention, I'm on the fence—maybe 4 if it's affordable, otherwise lower.
