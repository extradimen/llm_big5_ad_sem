Alright, let's break down my thought process here. I'm a 40-49-year-old male from China with a bachelor's degree working as a blue-collar worker and currently divorced. My monthly income is under 15 million VND. 

Looking at the ad, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." First off, I'm not really talkative but agree that I'm outgoing and helpful. The ad's message about staying energized might appeal to someone looking for a boost in daily life, especially with my age where energy levels can be a concern. However, the part about "look your best" seems a bit superficial. Given my reserved nature, I don't see myself being overly influenced by appearances.

I worry a lot and tend to get nervous easily, which makes me cautious about products. The ad doesn't provide any concrete evidence or details, so it feels a bit too vague. Without specific benefits or proof, it's hard for me to trust the claims fully. My tendency towards thoroughness means I'd usually want more information before considering a purchase.

Economically, my income is limited, so I'm mindful of spending. The ad doesn't address affordability or value for money, which makes me question if this product fits into my budget. Additionally, while I have an active imagination and like original ideas, the ad's message feels generic and not particularly innovative.

Considering all these factors—my cautious nature, financial constraints, and the lack of detailed information in the ad—I'm not very convinced. The ad doesn't resonate strongly with me, so my attitude towards it is neutral to slightly negative, and my purchase intention is low.
