Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're from China, female, in her late thirties with a postgraduate degree. She's single and living with her parents, earning over 46 million VND a month. Her personality traits are quite specific—she's outgoing but sometimes rude, not too helpful, not trusting, thorough in some areas but not all, makes plans, isn't careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, has an active imagination, and original with new ideas.

Now, the ad is "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target someone looking to maintain energy levels and appear vibrant.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is outgoing (strongly agrees) but sometimes rude. They might not connect with ads that are too upbeat or perhaps find it over the top, depending on the tone.
   - Maybe a 3 because she's neutral about being talkative and helpful, which could influence her feelings toward the ad.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas (neutral). The ad isn't particularly innovative, so perhaps not very interesting to her—maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - She's critical but might find it somewhat effective in conveying its message. Maybe a 5 as she neither strongly agrees nor disagrees.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being outgoing and sociable, she might find it somewhat attractive if it's appealing visually or emotionally, but perhaps not extremely so—maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - She earns a high income, which means she can afford luxury items. However, her tendency to worry a lot and be nervous might make her cautious about new products. Maybe a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - She makes plans and follows through (strongly agrees), so if she's interested, she might try it. But considering her critical nature, maybe a 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Given her income, she's likely to consider options before purchasing, so perhaps a 5.

I need to make sure the scores align with each trait. She's not very trusting (strongly disagrees), which might lower her belief in the ad. Her tendency to worry and get nervous could affect her purchase intention negatively. However, being outgoing and having an active imagination might give some positive inclination towards the ad.
