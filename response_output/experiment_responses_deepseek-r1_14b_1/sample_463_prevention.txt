Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the demographic profile. He's a Chinese male in his 50s, a civil servant with a high school education, divorced, and earns between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so he might be comfortable spending on certain products.

His personality traits: He strongly disagrees that he's talkative and outgoing, but is neutral about being sociable. He agrees with being reserved, which suggests he prefers more private interactions. He's neutral regarding helpfulness, slightly distrustful, not rude, thorough in his work, but doesn't make plans often. He tends to be careful, gets nervous easily but is emotionally stable. He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas, which shows creativity.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. The message implies that without this drink, one might lack energy or appear unattractive.

Considering his personality, he's reserved but has an active imagination. He's thorough in his work, so maybe the ad speaks to him about maintaining his image or performance. However, being a civil servant with a high income, perhaps he's more concerned about health and appearance. 

Looking at the attitude scores:
1. I like the ad: Since he's reserved, he might not be strongly drawn to an ad that's too flashy. Maybe 3 (Agree).
2. Interesting: The message is clear but not overly engaging for a reserved person. Perhaps 4.
3. Good: If it's informative, maybe 5.
4. Attractive: Not very visually appealing if described simply, so maybe 4.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: He's careful and thorough, might need more info before deciding. Maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: Might consider after thinking, so 4.
3. Consider buying: Yes, it's on his radar, so 5.

I think these scores make sense given his traits. He's cautious but not entirely dismissive of the ad's message.
