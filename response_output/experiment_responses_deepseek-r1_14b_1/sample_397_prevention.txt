Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. First, I'll break down her profile and traits.

She's from China, over 60 years old, married, with a high income but only a high school education. She's a student, so maybe she's taking some courses or just studying for personal growth.

Her personality: She's neutral on being talkative, outgoing, reserved, helpful, etc., but strongly agrees that she is trusting and sometimes rude. Neutral on thoroughness and planning, disagrees with making plans, isn't careless, not easily nervous, has an active imagination, original, and agrees she has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting feelings of fatigue and looking unattractive without the product. Given her age, she might be concerned about staying energetic and maintaining a good appearance.

She strongly agrees with being trusting, which makes her more likely to believe the ad. But she also sometimes feels rude, so maybe the message is direct but not necessarily off-putting. She's original and has an active imagination, so the ad needs to be creative enough.

Considering her age and income, she might be looking for products that help with energy and vitality. The ad seems to tap into that need. But since she doesn't make plans much (disagrees), maybe she isn't someone who follows through on purchases easily unless convinced.

She's emotionally stable but has an active imagination, so the ad needs to resonate emotionally without being too over-the-top. The message about feeling tired and looking dull could appeal to her desire to maintain a youthful appearance and energy levels.

Her high income suggests she can afford such products, but her education level might mean she prefers clear, straightforward information rather than overly complicated ads.

Putting this together: The ad is direct and addresses real concerns for someone her age. It's interesting because it ties into health and appearance, which are important. She trusts the message, so she believes it's good. The ad is attractive enough to capture her attention, but she might not feel a strong emotional pull since she's emotionally stable.

For purchase intention: She might consider buying it because it addresses her potential needs, but she's not someone who makes quick decisions (disagrees with making plans). So she could be on the fence. Whether she'll try to buy or actually intend to depends on how much she feels the product meets her needs.

So scoring-wise:
- Like: 4
- Interesting:5
- Good:5
- Attractive:4

Purchase intention:
- Intend:3 (maybe)
- Try:4
- Consider:5 (probably)

Wait, maybe I should adjust. Since she is trusting and the ad speaks to her concerns, perhaps she's more likely to consider it. So:

Ad attitude scores might be higher, purchase intentions a bit lower but still in middle.

Alternatively, considering her tendency to be sometimes rude, maybe she doesn't like overtly pushy ads, so her 'like' score could be lower.
