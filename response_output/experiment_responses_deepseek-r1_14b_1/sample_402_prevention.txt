Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at her demographic profile. She's a Chinese woman in her 20s with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker and is divorced. Her monthly income is under 15 million VND. Her personality traits show she's strongly trusting but sometimes rude, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, has an active imagination, and is original but not very artistic.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

I need to evaluate how the ad would affect her based on her traits. Let me think about each part.

For attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - She tends to be trusting (strongly agree) but sometimes rude (strongly agree). The ad makes a strong claim, so maybe she likes it because it's attention-grabbing. But being sometimes rude might make her critical of such claims. So maybe 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas (agree). The tagline is catchy and makes you imagine feeling tired without the drink, which could be interesting to her. Maybe a 4 or 5. Let's say 5.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - She tends to worry a lot (neutral) but is emotionally stable (strongly agree). The ad's message about not wanting to feel tired or look dull might resonate because she values being presentable, perhaps? But she's also careless and nervous easily. Maybe 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - She's talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing (neutral), reserved (neutral). Since she's not very outgoing, maybe the ad isn't extremely attractive to her. Perhaps a 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - She tends to be careless and make plans sometimes (neutral). The ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without it. If she values her appearance and energy, maybe she's more likely to consider it, but since she's on a budget (income <15M VND), the price might be a factor. Maybe 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - She gets nervous easily and is sometimes rude. The ad makes a compelling point, but her tendency towards carelessness might make her not prioritize it. Perhaps 4? Or lower. Let's say 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Given the reasons above, she might think about it if she feels tired often or cares about looking good. Maybe she'll consider it, so a higher score like 5.

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me adjust.

Perhaps for ad attitude:

1. Like: The ad is attention-grabbing but maybe not to her taste because of the reasons above, so 3.
2. Interesting: She likes imaginative ads, so 5.
3. Good: She might not fully trust it, so 4.
4. Attractive: Not sure, maybe 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: Maybe she's more on the fence, so 4?
Wait, no, considering her traits, perhaps lower.

Alternatively, thinking again, since she has an active imagination and likes new ideas, the ad's message might resonate more. So for purchase intent:

1. I intend to buy: Maybe a 5 because it addresses her possible concerns about tiredness and appearance.
2. Try to buy: Perhaps 4, as she might not rush but consider it.
3. Consider buying: Definitely higher, maybe 6.

But wait, her income is low, so the price could be a barrier. That might lower all scores.

Maybe adjust the ad attitude:

1. Like: 4
2. Interesting:5
3. Good:4
4. Attractive:4

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: Maybe 3
2. Try:3
3. Consider:5

Hmm, I think I need to be more precise.
