Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my personality traits: I'm talkative and outgoing, which might make social interactions important to me. The ad targets tiredness and looking dull, which could relate to situations where I need to stay alert or present myself well socially.

I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe the ad's message about feeling tired affects not just me but others around me. However, I don't generally trust people much, which might make me skeptical of such ads. The ad feels a bit manipulative because it's implying that without the drink, negative outcomes will happen.

I'm outgoing and like to make plans, so being tired could interfere with my social life. But at the same time, I tend to be careless sometimes and don't worry a lot, which might mean I don't prioritize such products highly.

For the ad attitude scores:
1. Like: I'm neutral because while the message is relevant, it's also a bit pushy.
2. Interesting: It's somewhat interesting but not enough to make me strongly feel one way.
3. Good: Neutral again; the message isn't particularly bad or good in my view.
4. Attractive: Not very attractive because of the manipulative tone.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: I don't have a strong intent since I might not see immediate need.
2. Try: Maybe if it's convenient, but probably won't go out of my way.
3. Consider: Possibly in the future, but not actively considering right now.
