Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a student from China who's married and earns over 46 million VND monthly, which is quite high for a student, so maybe my spouse contributes to the income. My personality traits show that I'm talkative? No, strongly disagree. Outgoing? Disagree. Reserved? Also strongly disagree. Hmm, that leaves me somewhere in the middle regarding social aspects.

I find myself being helpful and unselfish, but it's neutral. Trusting? Not really, as I disagree on that. Rude? Never, strongly disagree. Thorough job? Yes, agree. Making plans and following through is a strong yes for me. Careless? Definitely not. Nervous or worried a lot? No, I'm pretty stable emotionally. I have an active imagination? Disagree, but I do come up with new ideas, so that's strongly agree. Artistic interests are something I strongly disagree with.

Now the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. Given my thoroughness and planning nature, maybe I value such products for their effectiveness. However, the message is a bit negative—focusing on what happens without the product. But as someone who makes plans, perhaps I appreciate the proactive approach of preventing tiredness.

I like ads that are informative but not too pushy. This one seems to suggest potential issues without the drink, which might make me consider it for its preventive benefits. However, my emotional stability and being untrusting might make me question the ad's claims. Do they have evidence backing this? Without knowing, I'm somewhat skeptical.

Looking at attitude toward the ad: I don't dislike it, but neither do I find it extremely interesting or good. It's neutral to slightly positive. For purchase intention, since I’m thorough and planful, maybe I’d consider trying it if convinced of its benefits. But without strong evidence, my consideration might be low.

So for attitude scores: 3, 4, 5, 6? Not sure yet. Maybe a bit lower as the message is negative. Purchase intention: 3, 3, 4 perhaps.
