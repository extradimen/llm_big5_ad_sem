Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**: The ad's message about staying energized and looking good is positive, but it feels a bit generic. I don't find it particularly exciting or unique, so my liking isn't very strong.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**: While not groundbreaking, the idea of combining energy with appearance might appeal to some. It's somewhat interesting because it targets both physical and mental aspects, but nothing stands out as特别引人注目.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (3/7)**: The message is clear and positive, which I appreciate. However, without specific details or a strong emotional hook, my belief in its effectiveness isn't high.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**: The visual aspects might be appealing if well-designed. Even though the content isn't unique, good visuals could make it attractively engaging.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**: I'm not convinced by the ad alone. There's a lack of specifics about what makes the drink effective or different from others, so intent is low.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**: If the price is right and there are promotions, I might consider trying it once. It's not a strong must-buy, but could be an option under certain conditions.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**: The ad makes me think about whether it could benefit me, so I'm somewhat open to considering it if other factors align.
