Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: they're a Chinese male in his 30s, with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, earning between 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he is outgoing and sociable but not talkative, which seems contradictory. He finds it neutral to be rude, which might mean he's sometimes reserved in interactions. He doesn't see himself as helpful or unselfish, which could indicate he values independence more. He worries a lot, so stress is a concern for him.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target feelings of fatigue and its effects on appearance. The person in question might be concerned about looking good and feeling energetic, especially since he's outgoing but perhaps sometimes careless or worried.

For attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: He's outgoing but not talkative, so maybe the message is clear but doesn't resonate deeply. I'd give a 4.
2. Interesting: The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull could be interesting. Maybe a 5.
3. Good: The ad seems to address real concerns, so perhaps a 6.
4. Attractive: It's a common message, not overly creative, so maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: He might consider it but isn't sure yet, so 4.
2. Try: Maybe he'll give it a shot if it fits his routine, so 5.
3. Consider: Definitely on the list, so a higher score like 6.

I think these scores reflect his cautious approach and concern for looking good but not being overly convinced by the ad.
