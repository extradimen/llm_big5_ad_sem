Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese female in her 50s with a postgraduate degree, currently a student and divorced. My income is less than 15 million VND per month.

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message seems to target people who are feeling exhausted and want to appear more vibrant. Since I'm a student, juggling studies and other responsibilities might lead to feeling tired, so this could be relevant.

Personality-wise, I tend to agree with being trusting but sometimes rude. I'm thorough in my work, make plans, and follow through, which means I'm organized. However, I worry a lot and get nervous easily, which affects my emotions. My imagination is low, but I'm original and come up with new ideas.

The ad's message is straightforward, focusing on the negative consequences of not using the product. This fear appeal might resonate with me because it highlights potential social issues like looking dull, which could impact how others perceive me. Given that I value being helpful and unselfish but sometimes worry about my appearance, this ad taps into those concerns.

On the other hand, I'm reserved and find it hard to be talkative, so an ad that emphasizes social presentation might not align perfectly with my outgoingness. But since I'm also original and imaginative in some ways, the idea of looking dull could play on my desire to present well despite being more introverted.

Considering purchase intention, as someone who values thoroughness, I'd want clear evidence or benefits from the product. The ad doesn't provide specifics about how the drink helps beyond not feeling tired or looking dull. However, the emotional appeal might make me consider it more than a typical advertisement because it addresses potential social anxieties.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: I find it interesting and somewhat good because it's targeting real feelings, but since it's a bit manipulative with fear, my attraction to it isn't high. For purchase intention, while I don't intend to buy immediately, I might consider trying it if others recommend it or if more information is provided.

So, scoring:

Ad attitude: 3 (like), 4 (interesting), 5 (good), 4 (attractive).

Purchase intention: 4 (intend), 4 (try), 5 (consider).
