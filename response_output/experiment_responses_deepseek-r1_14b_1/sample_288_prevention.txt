Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're from China, male, in his early twenties, single, with a high income of around 36 million VND monthly. That's quite a lot, so he might be living comfortably or maybe in an urban area where costs are higher.

Looking at his personality traits:

- He's talkative and outgoing but also sometimes rude. So he enjoys social interactions but may not always handle them with the utmost politeness.
- He doesn't see himself as helpful or unselfish, which suggests he might prioritize his own needs over others.
- His trust levels are neutral, so he's neither very trusting nor skeptical.
- He tends to be careless but makes plans and follows through. So while he might not always be cautious, when he does make plans, he sticks to them.
- He gets nervous easily, which could affect his decision-making under stress.
- Emotionally stable is a disagreement point, so maybe he has some mood swings or isn't too steady emotionally.
- He doesn't have an active imagination but thinks he's original and comes up with new ideas. Interesting contradiction thereâ€”he might not imagine things creatively but believes in his ability to innovate.

Now, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting tiredness and looking unattractive without the product.

Considering his traits:

- He likes being talkative and outgoing, so maybe he values appearing energetic and presentable in social settings.
- Being sometimes rude might not be a strong factor here unless the ad plays on that trait.
- His income is high, which suggests he might be willing to spend on products that enhance his image or energy levels.
- He's neutral on trusting, so the ad needs to be credible but doesn't have an edge there.
- He tends to follow through with plans, so if the product helps him maintain energy, it could align with his lifestyle.

The ad is trying to prevent tiredness and looking dull, which are negatives that people often want to avoid. Since he values social interactions and being presentable, this could resonate. However, he's not very trusting, so the ad needs to be persuasive enough without sounding too salesy.

For his attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: The message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull, which could make him feel better in social situations. Since he's outgoing, this might appeal to him, but if he finds it too pushy, he might not like it.
2. Interesting: If the ad highlights how the drink can keep him energized and presentable, it could be interesting. Maybe a 5 or 6 here.
3. Good: The effectiveness of the message is key. If it's clear and relatable, it's good, so maybe a 4 or 5.
4. Attractive: Visual appeal matters too. If the ad has appealing visuals, he might find it attractive, but if it's too generic, maybe not.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: High income means he can afford, but does he see the value? Maybe a 3 or 4.
2. Try to buy: If the ad makes him curious, he might try it once, so around a 4.
3. Consider buying: He's planning-oriented, so if the product aligns with his goals, he'll consider it, maybe a 5.

I need to balance between his outgoing nature and his tendency to be careless or not trust much. The ad should highlight benefits clearly but not overpromise. Since he values social presentation, the message about looking dull might hit home.
