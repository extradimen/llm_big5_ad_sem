Okay, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits. 

First, I'm from China, specifically under 20 years old, so probably still in high school. My monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which isn't too bad for my age, but I might not be making decisions about purchases on my own yet. I work as a blue-collar worker, which could mean体力劳动者 or something similar, maybe in manufacturing or construction.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm talkative and outgoing, but also reserved. That seems a bit contradictory. Maybe I'm more of an introvert in some situations but can be outgoing when needed. I don't see myself as helpful and unselfish; instead, I might prioritize my own needs. Trust is something I don't feel strongly about—I tend to be more cautious. Sometimes, I can come off as rude, though not intentionally. I'm careless, which means I might not pay attention to details or the long-term consequences of my actions. Getting nervous easily and having an active imagination make me someone who might overthink things but also creative. I'm original and like coming up with new ideas, but I have few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Do I like it? The ad seems to target energy and appearance. Since I'm outgoing, maybe this appeals to me because being energetic is important for social interactions. But I'm also reserved, so maybe not. Also, looking my best could be appealing if I care about how I present myself.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, but the combination of staying energized and looking good might catch my attention, especially since it's presented as something that can help daily.
3. Good: As someone who values originality and new ideas, the ad feels somewhat generic, so maybe not the best. Also, I'm cautious about ads; does this one deliver on its promises?
4. Attractive: The promise of energy and looking good is attractive, but as a blue-collar worker, maybe the practical benefits are more important.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? Not sure yet—need to see if it's worth the price.
2. Try buying it: Might consider trying once, especially if friends talk about it or there’s a promotion.
3. Consider buying: If I'm interested in improving my energy levels and appearance, I might think about it, but other factors like cost could influence me.

Scoring:
- Ad attitude: 4 (like), 5 (interesting), 4 (good), 5 (attractive). Wait, maybe a bit higher since the promises are strong but I'm cautious.
Wait, reconsidering: Since I'm talkative and outgoing, being energized is important. Maybe "I like it" would be around 5. Interesting might be 6 because the idea of combining both energy and appearance is unique. Good could be 5 as it's a typical ad. Attractive might be 6 because the benefits are appealing.

Purchase intention: Intend to purchase—maybe 4, try—5, consider—6. Because while I'm interested, I need more reasons or maybe a discount to actually buy it.
