Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let me think about my background as a 30â€“39 year old male from China with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant. I'm divorced, earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing but not talkative, neutral in helpfulness and worrying, sometimes trusting or not, disagreeable on thoroughness and planning, tend to be careless, get nervous easily, emotionally stable, have an active imagination, original with ideas, but strongly agree that I have few artistic interests.

The ad is targeting people who might feel tired and look dull without the drink. So it's probably a product meant to help with energy or appearance.

Looking at the first part about attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, the message seems direct but maybe a bit negative. It uses fear of looking bad to sell the product. I'm not sure if that resonates with me. Maybe it's okay, but I'm not overly excited. So maybe a 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? It's straightforward and points out potential problems without the drink. It's clear but perhaps too simple. Not particularly engaging for me. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear, but it might be seen as manipulative or using fear appeal, which I'm somewhat disagreeable with. So probably a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? Ads that focus on improving appearance and energy can be appealing, especially for someone in their thirties who might value looking good. But I'm not sure if this is the most attractive angle. Maybe around a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Not really. The ad doesn't make me feel like I need it immediately. There are other factors, like trust and whether I believe in the product's effectiveness. So maybe a 5.

2. Will I try to buy it? If the product is available and there's an offer, maybe I'd consider it. But not a strong intention yet. Maybe a 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? Yes, if I saw it somewhere or had more information about its benefits. So perhaps a 6.
