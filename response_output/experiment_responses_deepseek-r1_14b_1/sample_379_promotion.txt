Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my reaction to this advertisement. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my demographic profile, I'm a 30â€“39-year-old woman from China with a high school education, working as a managerial employee, divorced, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing and sociable (strongly disagree), reserved (neutral), helpful and unselfish (strongly disagree), trusting (strongly disagree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough job (neutral), makes plans and follows through (strongly disagree), careless (disagree), gets nervous easily (agree), worries a lot (agree), emotionally stable (strongly disagree), active imagination (disagree), original with ideas (strongly disagree), few artistic interests (neutral).

Now, evaluating the ad. I'm not very talkative or outgoing, so ads that focus on social interaction might not appeal to me much. The ad's main selling points are staying energized and looking good. As a managerial employee, being energized could be important for work performance, which is a plus. Looking good might also be appealing socially, but since I'm reserved, maybe the social aspect isn't as important.

The ad doesn't mention any specific benefits tailored to my situation, like career success or something else relevant to my job. It's quite vague. Also, I tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily, so maybe the idea of looking good every day adds pressure, which could be stressful rather than appealing.

I'm not someone who comes up with new ideas or is very imaginative, but the ad doesn't seem to offer anything original either. It's a common energy drink claim. My personality leans towards being more reserved and less trusting, so I might question whether this product truly delivers as advertised.

Looking at attitude toward the ad:
1. Do I like it? Not really; it feels too generic and not tailored to me.
2. Interesting? No, it doesn't stand out or capture my interest.
3. Is it good? Probably a 4 because it's functional but lacks depth.
4. Attractive? Maybe a 5, as the idea of looking good is somewhat appealing, but overall not very attractive.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: 2/7. I might consider it if others recommend or if I see evidence of its benefits.
2. Try to buy: 3/7. There's some interest, but not strong enough to actively seek out.
3. Consider buying: 4/7. It's on my radar, but other factors will influence the decision.

I'm scoring lower because while the ad targets a need I have (energy), it doesn't resonate with me personally or offer anything unique that would make me feel compelled to buy it. Plus, my personality traits like being less trusting and sometimes rude might make me more skeptical of such claims.
