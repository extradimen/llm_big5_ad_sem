Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad's message: it focuses on energy and looking good daily. As a managerial employee in China, staying energized is important for work performance. However, I find the ad too generic; similar products make the same claims without adding much value. This makes me less likely to be interested.

Personality-wise, being reserved and helpful means I prefer ads that offer clear benefits without overpromising. The ad doesn't provide specifics on how it helps look better or boosts energy uniquely. My tendency to worry a lot might make me question the product's effectiveness and safety, which affects my trust in the ad.

I'm original and imaginative, so an ad with unique creative concepts would appeal more. This ad lacks that uniqueness, making it less engaging. Additionally, I don't feel emotionally stable, so ads that rely on emotional appeal without substance aren't effective for me.

For purchase intention, while the benefits are appealing, there's no compelling reason to choose this product over others. My neutral stance on planning and following through means I'm not immediately motivated to act. The lack of specific details makes me unsure about trying it.
