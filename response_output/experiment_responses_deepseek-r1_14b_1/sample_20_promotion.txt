Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese female civil servant in my mid-30s with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income of about 16-25 million VND. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, being an outgoing person, I do enjoy ads that are vibrant and positive. This ad seems to promote a healthy and energetic lifestyle, which aligns with modern values. It's appealing because it targets both energy and appearance, which are important for professionals. So, maybe around a 5 or 6.

2. Is the ad interesting? Since I find myself looking for products that enhance my daily performance, this drink sounds relevant. It touches on staying energized, which is crucial for a busy civil servant. That's probably a 6.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear and relatable. However, without seeing visuals or more details, it might not be compelling enough. Maybe a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? Attractiveness depends on the presentation. If the ad uses appealing imagery or storytelling, it could score higher. But based solely on the text, perhaps a 5.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? With my busy schedule, an energizing drink could be useful. However, there are many brands out there, and without knowing more about the product's quality or benefits, I'm not sure. Maybe a 4.

2. Will I try to buy it? Trying once is possible if it's easily accessible. But again, without specific reasons to choose this brand over others, perhaps a 5.

3. Will I consider buying it? Definitely, as it addresses my needs, but only after more information or positive reviews. So maybe a 6.
