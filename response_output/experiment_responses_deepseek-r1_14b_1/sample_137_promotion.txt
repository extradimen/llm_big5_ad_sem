Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (1)**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given that I'm a managerial employee in my 40s, staying productive and presentable is important. However, the claim seems too generic without specifics on how it works or benefits. Plus, I tend to be reserved and don't usually get excited about such ads. So, maybe a low score here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (3)**: The message targets two key areas—energy and appearance—which are relevant. It's not bad, but without detailed information or emotional appeal, it's just okay. Neutral to slightly positive.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4)**: While the ad makes some valid points about energy and appearance, the lack of credibility and specific benefits makes me hesitant. Not sure if I fully trust it.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (2)**: The visuals might be nice, but without a strong emotional hook or clear message, it doesn't stand out enough for me. So, a low score here.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3)**: I'm more practical. Without seeing results or specific benefits tailored to my needs, I don't feel compelled to buy immediately.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4)**: There's some interest in the idea of staying energized and looking good, so maybe I'd consider a trial if it were available, but not a sure thing.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5)**: It does touch on aspects that matter to me, so I might think about it more if there's an opportunity or more information provided.
