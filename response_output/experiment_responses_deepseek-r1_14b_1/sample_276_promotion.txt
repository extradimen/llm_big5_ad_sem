Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm a 30â€“39-year-old Chinese male with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker and married, earning around 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative, outgoing, helpful, trusting, sometimes careless, get nervous easily, emotionally stable, original but not very artistic.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. I need to evaluate how this ad would resonate with me based on my background and personality.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, the drink sounds good because it offers energy and looking good. But I'm not sure if the ad is aimed at people like me. Maybe it's more for younger or professionals? Since I'm a blue-collar worker, maybe I don't see this as relevant. So probably neutral to slightly disagree.

2. Is the ad interesting? It's about staying energized and looking good, which are positive things. But does it capture my attention? Maybe not if it's too focused on appearance or targeted towards different groups. So neutral again.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear but maybe too generic. It doesn't seem to speak directly to me as a blue-collar worker. So neutral.

4. Is the ad attractive? The idea of looking good is appealing, but if it's not targeting my lifestyle, it might not be very attractive. Neutral.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? Probably not, because there are cheaper alternatives and I'm more focused on practical needs. Maybe a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? If I see it somewhere affordable, maybe, but probably not actively seeking it out. So around a 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? It depends if the price is reasonable and available where I am. So maybe a 5 or so.
