Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. They're a middle-aged Chinese male with a postgraduate degree and work as a managerial employee. He's married and earns less than 15 million VND a month.

Looking at his personality traits, he's talkative and outgoing but also somewhat reserved. He strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean he values individuality over others. He's very trusting and sometimes rude, so maybe he doesn't like overly pushy ads. He does thorough jobs, plans well, isn't careless or nervous, is emotionally stable, lacks an active imagination, and doesn't have strong artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target fatigue and the appearance, appealing to someone looking to stay energetic and presentable. Given his age and occupation, he might be busy and value staying alert and looking good.

Since he's outgoing and trusts ads, but sometimes rude and not very trusting of others' help, maybe the ad's message is a bit direct for him. He doesn't like being told what to do, so the ad's statement could come off as too pushy or manipulative. His neutral feelings towards planning might mean he's not immediately drawn to products that promise improvement without clear evidence.

He tends to be thorough and does jobs well, but if the ad doesn't provide enough information or is too vague, he might find it unconvincing. Therefore, his initial reaction might be neutral to slightly negative towards liking the ad because it feels too simplistic or manipulative. He might not find it interesting or good either.

Regarding purchase intention, since he's in a managerial role and possibly busy, he might consider products that help with energy, but without strong belief in the ad, he wouldn't feel compelled to buy it. However, considering his thorough nature, he might be open to trying it after more information, so 'consider' would make sense.

So, I'd say his scores for attitude towards the ad are all around 3-4, and purchase intentions are lower but with a chance to consider.
