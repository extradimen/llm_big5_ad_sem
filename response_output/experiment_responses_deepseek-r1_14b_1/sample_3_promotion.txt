Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. So, the person is a Chinese woman over 60 with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant and married, earning between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's talkative and outgoing but not reserved, sometimes rude, emotionally stable, and has few artistic interests.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to consider her attitude towards the ad. She is talkative and outgoing, which might make her more open to messages about social interactions or looking good. However, she's sometimes rude, so maybe she doesn't connect with overly positive ads. She's emotionally stable, which could mean she's not swayed easily by emotional appeals.

Looking at the ad's message: staying energized and looking good. For someone in her age group, health and appearance might be important, especially if she's a civil servant and possibly concerned about projecting an image of vitality and professionalism.

She has few artistic interests, so the ad's appeal might not resonate with her if it's too focused on aesthetics or creativity. Her personality traits suggest she's more practical. Also, since she's a civil servant, she might be cautious about products making grand claims without evidence.

Now, evaluating the attitude scores:

1. I like the ad. She might not strongly like it because the message is somewhat generic and might feel over-the-top for her reserved nature.
2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized is relevant, but maybe not particularly interesting given her other traits.
3. Good: It's a positive message, but without strong emotional appeal or specific benefits, she might not find it excellent.
4. Attractive: The ad's visuals and message are likely basic, so she might not find them very attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She's cautious about products making broad claims, especially without seeing proof.
2. Try to buy: Maybe a 3 since the idea is somewhat appealing, but she's not convinced yet.
3. Consider buying: She might think about it if others recommend or if she sees more evidence.

I'm thinking her scores would be moderate on both attitude and purchase intention, leaning towards neutral to slightly negative on attitude and cautious on purchasing.
