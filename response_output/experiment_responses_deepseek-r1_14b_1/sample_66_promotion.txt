Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm supposed to evaluate an advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let's break down the components of the ad. It mentions staying energized and looking one's best daily. These are pretty common selling points for energy drinks or beverages aimed at improving both physical performance and appearance.

Now, considering my demographics: I'm a male student from China under 20 with a bachelor’s degree. My monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND, which is quite high for a student, maybe indicating some family support or part-time income. Being single (divorced) might mean I have more disposable time but perhaps less focus on long-term commitments.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative and outgoing: Strongly Agree. So social interactions are important to me.
- Reserved: Disagree. Not really, so fitting with being talkative.
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree. Maybe not the most community-oriented.
- Trusting: Disagree. I might be skeptical of claims.
- Rude: Disagree. Politeness is valued.
- Thorough job: Disagree. I might prefer efficiency over thoroughness.
- Make plans and follow through: Agree. So, I'm goal-oriented.
- Careless: Strongly Disagree. I’m careful.
- Nervous easily: Strongly Disagree. Not easily anxious.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree. Tend to stress.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree. Maybe mood swings or high emotional response.
- Active imagination: Agree. Creative.
- Original ideas: Strongly Disagree. Maybe not the most innovative.
- Artistic interests: Strongly Agree. Enjoy art and aesthetics.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. The ad focuses on energy and looking good. For someone my age, especially a student, staying energized could be appealing if they have busy schedules or need to stay alert for studies or social activities. However, since I'm disagree with being helpful/unselfish and trusting, I might question the credibility of such claims. Also, considering my income level, maybe I’m more price-sensitive or look for value.

2. The ad's message is clear but might be too generic. It doesn’t address specific pain points or offer unique benefits beyond what others do. Given that I worry a lot and have an active imagination, perhaps the ad could evoke fear of not keeping up with peers who are energized and looking good. But since I’m skeptical (disagree on trusting), I might discount such emotional appeals.

3. The purchase intention: While the idea is appealing, my tendency to be thorough (disagree) makes me question if this product is worth the price. Also, being careful (strongly disagree) means I’d want more information or reviews before buying. My high income suggests I can afford it, but without a strong emotional connection or specific benefits beyond what's stated, I might not feel compelled to purchase.

On the ad attitude scores:

1. Like: The message is positive and relatable for students aiming to stay active and presentable. But given my skepticism, maybe 4/7.
2. Interesting: It’s a common claim but could be seen as interesting because of the combination of energy and appearance. Maybe 5/7.
3. Good: As an ad, it's functional but not particularly innovative or emotionally resonant for me. Perhaps 4/7.
4. Attractive: The visuals and message might be attractive to a social crowd, but my personal skepticism brings it down to maybe 4/7.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: I'm interested but not sure if I'll purchase. Maybe 3/7.
2. Try: Might consider trying it once or in a limited way. Perhaps 5/7 (since I’m curious).
3. Consider: Definitely on the radar, so maybe 6/7.

Wait, that seems inconsistent because if I'm only intending at 3, trying at 5, and considering at 6, that's a bit conflicting. Maybe I need to adjust.

Alternatively, since the ad speaks to goals I might have (looking good, staying energized), but my skepticism makes me cautious. So perhaps:

- Ad attitude scores: [4, 5, 4, 4]
- Purchase intention: [3, 4, 5]

But I'm not entirely sure about these numbers. Maybe I should think more on how much each factor influences.

Another angle: Since I’m a student with high income but possibly busy, maybe the convenience and perceived benefits could drive intent higher. However, without trust in the ad's claims, it might be lower.

Perhaps:

Ad attitude: [3, 4, 3, 3] (because skeptical)
Purchase intention: [2, 3, 4]

But I'm not confident. Maybe better to go with initial thought of [4,5,4,4] for ad and [3,4,5] for purchase.

Wait, let me reevaluate:

- Like: The ad is positive but maybe overhyped; 4
- Interesting: Combines two key points, so interesting; 5
- Good: Functional, not flawed but not exceptional; 4
- Attractive: Visually appealing, but message might be too generic; 4

Purchase:

- Intend: Maybe 3 (I'm considering)
- Try: 5 (might try once)
- Consider: 6 (seriously thinking about it)

Wait, that makes sense. Because I’m more likely to consider buying after trying.

So final scores:

Ad attitude: [4,5,4,4]
Purchase intention: [3,5,6]

But wait, the scale is 1-7. So I think these numbers make sense.
