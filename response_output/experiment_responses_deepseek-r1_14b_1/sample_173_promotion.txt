Alright, let me break down how I arrived at each score for the ad and my purchase intentions. 

Starting with the advertisement itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance.

For attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** (Score: 5)  
   I'm not particularly drawn to ads that focus on energy or looking good, especially since they often target younger demographics. However, the message is clear and positive, so it's not dislikeable but doesn't excite me either.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** (Score: 4)  
   The idea of a drink combining energy with appearance appeal is somewhat intriguing, but I don't find it particularly engaging or innovative.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** (Score: 5)  
   It's straightforward and conveys its message effectively without being misleading. It's not bad, just neutral in impact.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** (Score: 4)  
   The ad isn't unattractive, but it doesn't stand out visually or emotionally to me.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** (Score: 3)  
   While the benefits are appealing, I'm not convinced enough to immediately buy the product. I'd want more information or a reason why this drink is better than others.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** (Score: 4)  
   If I saw it in a store and the price was reasonable, I might consider trying it once, especially if there's a promotion.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** (Score: 5)  
   The ad makes me think about whether this drink could fit into my lifestyle, so I'm open to considering it, but I wouldn't rush to purchase without more info.
