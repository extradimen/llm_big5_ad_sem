Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman who's a student, divorced, with a monthly income under 15 million VND. My personality traits are reserved, thorough in my work, not very trusting, and emotionally stable but not someone who worries much. 

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the product. I'm a student, so maybe I often feel tired from studying or taking care of things on my own since I'm divorced. The ad seems to target people who need energy and want to look good. 

Looking at the attitude toward the advertisement questions:

1. Do I like the ad? I don't know. It's trying to make me think that without this drink, I'll feel tired and look bad. But does it speak to me personally? Since I'm a student, maybe I can relate to feeling tired, but I'm reserved, so maybe ads aren't my favorite way to get messages. So, on the 7-point scale, maybe around 4 or 5—neither strongly dislike nor like.

2. Is the ad interesting? It's about energy and appearance. Those are relevant topics, especially for someone in their 40s who might be balancing work, study, and family. But I'm not sure if it's presented in an engaging way. Maybe a 3 or 4—neutral to slightly disagree.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? It makes strong claims but doesn't provide evidence. Without seeing any proof, like studies or testimonials, it's hard for me to fully trust. Since I'm strongly disagree with trusting people and generally not trusting, maybe a 2 or 3—don't really believe it.

4. Is the ad attractive? The visuals and message could be appealing if it shows someone vibrant and energetic. But since I'm reserved and don't find ads too exciting, maybe a 3 or 4. It's neutral to slightly unattractive.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? Probably not right away. Ads need to build trust over time. Since I don't believe the ad fully, my intent is low—maybe a 2.

2. Will I try to buy it? If I saw it in a store and felt curious, maybe. But without strong belief, perhaps a 3 or 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's on my radar because it addresses tiredness and looking good. So maybe a 4 or 5—neutral to leaning towards considering.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: [4, 3, 2, 3]
Purchase intention: [2, 3, 4]

I think that makes sense based on my personality traits and the ad's message.
