Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad claims the drink helps stay energized and look your best. Considering my reserved nature and tendency to worry a lot, I'm skeptical about such quick fixes. I don't find it particularly appealing or trustworthy.

For purchase intention: While the idea of energy and looking good is tempting, my practical side makes me question the product's effectiveness without more evidence. Plus, I'm not convinced the ad provides enough details to make an informed decision.
