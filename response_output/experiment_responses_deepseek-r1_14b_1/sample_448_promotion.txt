Alright, let me break down how I came up with each score for this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**: 3/7. I'm not sure if I like it because while staying energized is a good selling point, especially for someone in their busy 30s-40s, looking your best might be too vague. Also, given my personality of being talkative and outgoing, maybe not directly appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: 4/7. The idea of combining energy with appearance is intriguing, but without specifics on how it works, it feels a bit generic. Still, it's somewhat engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: 5/7. It addresses two key areas—energy and looking good—which are important for many people. The message is clear, which adds to its credibility.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: 6/7. The imagery of being energized and looking great is appealing. However, without seeing visuals, I'm imagining it, so maybe not as strong as it could be with actual creative elements.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: 3/7. While the benefits are good, there's no evidence provided on why this drink would work better than others. Without trust in the brand or specific claims, I'm hesitant to commit.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: 4/7. The ad is persuasive enough that if I came across it when shopping, I might pick it up to give a try, but it's not a must-have.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: 5/7. It does make me think about whether the drink could fit into my routine, especially considering I want to stay energized and presentable.
