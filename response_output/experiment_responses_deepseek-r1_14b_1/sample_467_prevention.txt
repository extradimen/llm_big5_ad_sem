Okay, I need to figure out how a person with this specific demographic and personality traits would react to the advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the demographic: They're from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, are divorced, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income, so they might be in a position where they can afford luxury or premium products.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Strongly Disagree. So, they're not someone who likes to chat a lot.
- Outgoing and sociable: Agree. They do enjoy being around people but aren't the life of the party.
- Reserved: Neutral. Sometimes they might hold back in social situations.
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral. Not overly so, but not selfish either.
- Trusting: Agree. They tend to trust others.
- Rude sometimes: Agree. So, there's a tendency to be impolite at times.
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree. They do things carefully.
- Plans and follows through: Agree. They're goal-oriented.
- Careless: Neutral.
- Nervous easily: Strongly Agree. They get nervous often.
- Worry a lot: Agree. They have anxiety.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral.
- Active imagination: Neutral.
- Original, new ideas: Agree. They are creative.
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree. Not into artsy stuff.

Now, the ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's a prevention message, focusing on avoiding negative outcomes.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Like the ad: The person might not like it because they're sometimes rude but also thorough in their thinking. The ad's message seems a bit generic and maybe manipulative to them since they can be critical.
2. Interesting: They are original and creative, so an ad that plays on emotions could be interesting, but the straightforward message might not engage them much.
3. Good: Being someone who worries a lot and is nervous, the ad's focus on preventing tiredness and dull looks might resonate as it addresses their concerns about looking good and feeling well. But they might also see it as too simplistic or trying too hard to manipulate them.
4. Attractive: The visual aspects matter, but since the user didn't provide details, I'll base it on the message's appeal. It could be somewhat attractive because it speaks to looking good and feeling energized.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: High income means they can afford it, but their critical nature might make them wait for more evidence or try the product first.
2. Try to buy: Since they are thorough and like to plan, maybe they'd want to test the product before fully committing.
3. Consider buying: They might think about it, especially if others recommend it or if they see a need after trying.

Putting this together, I'm thinking their scores would be moderate but leaning towards neutral to slightly negative because of their critical nature and tendency to get nervous, making them cautious about ads that seem too pushy.
