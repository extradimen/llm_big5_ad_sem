Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 50-59-year-old Chinese man with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND, and I'm divorced. From my personality traits, I'm talkative but not outgoing or sociable. I tend to be reserved, helpful, but not overly so. I don't trust people much, sometimes worry a lot, make plans but don't always follow through, can be careless, have an active imagination, and like coming up with new ideas.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, do I like the ad? It's targeting energy and looking good. Since I'm a bit older, maybe I'm more concerned about health and appearance. The drink sounds useful, but ads can be manipulative. I'm reserved, so I might not feel strongly positive or negative. So perhaps 3 on a scale of 1-7.

Is the ad interesting? It's not particularly exciting for me because while energy is good, looking your best might not resonate as much. Maybe neutral, around 4.

Is it good? The message seems positive but maybe too generic. I'm not convinced; it lacks depth. So I'd score it a 3.

Attractive? Not really. It's straightforward but doesn't stand out or make me feel anything strong. Maybe a 4.

Now for purchase intention: Do I intend to buy it? Probably not, since I have other priorities and this seems like a luxury. But maybe if I saw it elsewhere, I might consider trying once. So intent is low, try is neutral, consider is a bit higher but still not strong.

Scores would be 2 (intent), 3 (try), 4 (consider).
