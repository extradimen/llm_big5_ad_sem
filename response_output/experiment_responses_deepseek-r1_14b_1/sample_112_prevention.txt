Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 30-39 year old man from China with a postgraduate degree and working as a managerial employee, making around 36 million to 45 million VND a month. My personality traits show that I'm talkative and outgoing, which makes sense for my job where networking is important. However, I disagree with being helpful and unselfish, suggesting I might be more focused on personal goals. Trusting others strongly aligns with my managerial role, but I do make plans and follow through, so reliability is key.

Looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The ad seems to target professionals who need to maintain their energy and appear sharp. My personality traits indicate that while I'm outgoing, I might not see myself as needing such a product since I already manage stress effectively. However, my tendency to worry a lot (Agree) could make me more susceptible to ads that promise relief from fatigue.

I'm emotionally stable? Disagree. So maybe the ad's message about looking dull resonates because I value my appearance and performance. But on the other hand, being original and coming up with new ideas is something I disagree with, so maybe I don't connect with the creativity aspect of the product.

The ad suggests that without the drink, tiredness and a dull appearance are inevitable. This could play into my desire to maintain my image and energy levels. However, my thorough job score is strongly disagree, which might mean I'm not too concerned about minor inconveniences or effects from products.

For purchase intention: Intend to buy? Maybe not immediately since there are many products out there, but considering it as an option could be possible if the ad makes me think about my tiredness. Trying it might depend on recommendations or more compelling evidence. Considering buying it is possible because the ad taps into a real need for professionals.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: I find it somewhat interesting and good because it addresses a common issue, but I'm not strongly attracted to it as there are better ads out there.
