Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down their profile first.

They're from China, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree, and work in an office. They’re single with a monthly income under 15 million VND, which is about $700 USD. Their personality traits show they are talkative but not outgoing or reserved—they’re neutral there. They don’t see themselves as helpful or unselfish, so maybe more self-focused. Trust-wise, they’re neutral. They don't think they're rude, which is good. They do thorough work and are very into planning and following through—so they’re organized and detail-oriented.

They aren’t careless, which makes sense with the thoroughness. They’re not easily nervous or a worrier, so they’re pretty stable emotionally. But they have an inactive imagination and don't see themselves as original or coming up with new ideas. Artistic interests are low for them. So overall, this person is practical, organized, maybe a bit reserved, and doesn’t lean into creativity or social activities much.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It’s targeting the prevention of feeling tired and looking unattractive. For someone over 60, fatigue might be a real concern. The message is about avoiding tiredness and appearing less dull, which could relate to their desire for energy or social presentation.

Now, considering their personality: they are thorough and planful, so they value products that help them maintain their routine. However, they’re not very trusting, so the ad's credibility might be a question. The message is direct but maybe a bit too simplistic for someone who's educated and analytical. They might find it manipulative if they feel it’s making exaggerated claims.

Looking at their personality, they are emotionally stable and not easily nervous or worried, which means ads that cause anxiety might not work on them. But this ad isn’t fear-based; it's more about prevention of tiredness and looking dull. So maybe the message is relevant to their desire for efficiency but could come off as too surface-level.

Their low artistic interest and imagination mean they might not be drawn to creative or emotionally resonant ads, which this one doesn't seem to be. They’re practical, so the ad's focus on functionality (staying alert, looking good) might appeal to them.

Now, evaluating their attitude towards the ad: Would they like it? They are neutral in social traits but thorough in work—so maybe not strongly positive or negative. The ad is interesting if they relate to tiredness, which they likely do as an office worker over 60. It's good because it addresses a real need, but they might think it's a bit too pushy or simplistic.

As for purchase intention: They have strong agreement in making plans and following through, so if the ad makes them believe the product works, they might intend to buy it. But their neutral trust might make them skeptical, leading them not to try immediately but perhaps consider it after more information.

So putting it all together, I’d say their attitude is somewhat mixed—maybe 3s and 4s on the scale for liking, interesting, good, attractive. For purchase intention, they might be slightly interested but not strongly, so scores in the mid-range.
