Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The advertisement suggests that without this drink, one might feel tired and look dull. Given my personality traits, particularly being reserved (Strongly Agree) and having few artistic interests (Agree), I'm not very drawn to ads that focus on appearance or energy levels. It doesn't resonate with me personally. So, a 2 here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** Interesting would imply it captures my attention in some way. Since I have an active imagination (Strongly Disagree) and originality isn't a trait I strongly identify with, this ad doesn't seem to spark interest. A 3 on this one.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** For me, believing the ad is good ties into whether it's truthful or effective. Given that I'm generally trusting (Agree), but the content isn't particularly appealing to me based on my personality, my belief in the ad's effectiveness is neutral. A 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractiveness relates to how visually or conceptually compelling it is. Since I don't have much interest in artistic matters and the message doesn't align with my values, I'm not attracted to it. So a 3 again.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My monthly income is quite high (around 40 million VND), but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm compelled to buy every product advertised. The ad's message doesn't directly address my needs or interests, and given that I find the ad somewhat unappealing, my intention isn't strong. A 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying something new usually requires some level of interest or perceived benefit. Since the ad doesn't connect with me much, while I might be open to trying it if suggested elsewhere, my score here is a 4 because I'm somewhat indifferent but not actively seeking it.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering buying implies that under certain circumstances, like reviews or recommendations, I might think about purchasing. Given that I don't dislike the ad outright and have a neutral stance on its message, I'll give it a 5 as I could potentially consider it if influenced by other factors.
