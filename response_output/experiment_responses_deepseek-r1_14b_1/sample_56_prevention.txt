Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 60+ year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant. Let me break down the ad and how my background and personality might affect my response.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention message, targeting negative outcomes if you don't use their product. 

Starting with my demographics:
- I'm over 60, so maybe concerned about energy levels and looking good.
- As a civil servant, I might have a busy schedule, needing to stay alert.
- My income is quite high (36-45 million VND), so I can afford premium products.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Strongly Agree. So, ads that encourage social interaction or confidence might appeal to me.
- Outgoing and sociable: Agree. Similar reasoning as above.
- Reserved: Strongly Agree. Hmm, but outgoing and reserved seem conflicting. Maybe I'm selectively social.
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree. Perhaps I prefer products that benefit me directly.
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree. So, the ad needs to be credible.
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree. If the ad is pushy or not respectful, it might turn me off.
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree. The product should be effective and reliable.
- Make plans/follow through: Strongly Agree. Consistency in products is important.
- Careless: Strongly Disagree. I prefer careful and well-thought-out ads.
- Nervous: Neutral. Not too much of an impact, but stress might affect my decision.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree. So, not someone who's easily anxious about products.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral. My feelings towards the ad are more about logic than emotions.
- Active imagination/original: Strongly Disagree. I like straightforward messages.

Now, evaluating the ad:
1. It targets feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. For someone my age, these concerns might be relevant, especially if I want to maintain a professional appearance and energy levels.
2. The message is direct but maybe a bit pushy. Since I'm not very trusting, the ad needs to build credibility through other means, like brand reputation or clear benefits.
3. Prevention ads can be effective for health-conscious individuals. However, since I'm more reserved, I might prefer ads that are less in-your-face and more informative.

Thinking about my personality:
- Being talkative and outgoing suggests I value social confidence, which this ad indirectly supports by claiming it prevents looking dull.
- But being reserved means I might not be swayed easily; the ad needs to offer clear, tangible benefits without overpromising.
- Since I'm thorough and planful, I would look for consistent results from the product. Does the drink actually provide sustained energy? The ad doesn't specify, which could be a downside.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: Maybe not immediately because I need more information on effectiveness.
- Try to buy: If I see positive reviews or get more details, maybe I'd consider it.
- Consider buying: Possibly, if the product is recommended by others or if I feel my current energy levels are an issue.

So, in terms of attitude towards the ad:
1. Like: It's targeted but might be a bit too direct for someone reserved like me. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It touches on real concerns, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: Effective message but could use more details, perhaps a 4.
4. Attractive: The ad is clear but not very engaging visually described; maybe a 5.

Purchase intentions:
1. Intend: Not strong without more info, maybe a 3.
2. Try: If convinced by others or evidence, maybe a 4.
3. Consider: Definitely, as it's within my concerns, perhaps a 5.

Overall, the ad has potential but needs to address trust and provide more details on benefits to persuade me effectively.
