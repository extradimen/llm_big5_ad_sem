Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement says that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. As someone who is talkative but also tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, the idea of feeling tired resonates a bit because I know stress can affect me physically. However, the word "look dull" makes me pause. It seems like the ad is playing on insecurities about appearance, which might not strongly appeal to me since I don't prioritize looks over functionality or health benefits.

Looking at personality traits: I'm talkative (Agree) but not outgoing, so maybe I wouldn't connect as much with a social image focus. The ad's message is more about personal feelings rather than social interactions, which aligns somewhat with my reserved nature. However, being helpful and unselfish with others doesn't apply here, so the ad might not tap into that aspect of me.

For purchase intention: I make plans and follow through (Agree), so if this drink helps me stay energized, it could be part of my routine. But since I tend to be careless (Agree), maybe I wouldn't prioritize this over other more essential purchases unless there's a strong reason. Also, considering I'm on a budget with a monthly income under 15 million VND, the price point would matter. If it's affordable and offers clear benefits, I might consider it, but if not, probably not.

Overall, the ad is somewhat relevant but doesn't strongly align with my core values or needs beyond the immediate benefit of feeling less tired. Without more compelling reasons like taste, health benefits, or social appeal, my interest isn't very high. Hence, moderate scores for both attitude and purchase intention.
