Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 40-49 year old Chinese woman who's a student, divorced, with a high monthly income. My personality traits are that I'm outgoing and helpful, but sometimes careless and get nervous easily. 

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break this down. First, the key benefits here are energy and looking good. For someone my age, staying energetic is important, maybe to keep up with studies or daily tasks. Looking good might appeal to me because I want to feel presentable, especially since I'm a student and might want to look my best for others.

But considering my personality, I tend to be careless sometimes, so maybe I won't prioritize this product over other needs. Also, I get nervous easily, which could mean I'm more cautious about trying new products because of possible side effects or if it doesn't work as promised.

I'm outgoing and helpful, so the idea of looking good might align with my desire to present well socially. However, being a student with a high income in Vietnam (assuming VND), maybe I have other priorities for my money. The ad seems a bit too promotional without specific evidence, which might make me skeptical.

So for attitude toward the ad: It's not bad, but it doesn't strongly resonate because the benefits are somewhat generic and don't address specific concerns like taste, convenience, or any unique selling points I value. 

For purchase intention: I'm on the fence. The idea is appealing, but without more information, I might not rush to buy. I might consider it if others recommend it or if there's a discount.
