Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my response to this advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting people who might be concerned about feeling energetic and looking good. Now, considering my demographic profile: I'm a 60+ year old woman from China, living with parents, have a bachelor’s degree, work as a civil servant, and earn less than 15 million VND per month.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing (Strongly Agree), which means social interactions are important to me. However, I don't find myself helpful or unselfish (Disagree) so maybe the ad's message about looking good could appeal more on a personal level rather than helping others. I'm trusting (Strongly Agree), so credibility is key.

The ad mentions feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since I’m retired, perhaps I still have social engagements or want to maintain my appearance. The fear of looking dull might resonate if I value how others perceive me. But I'm also disagreeable when it comes to being helpful, which might not align with an ad that focuses on others' perceptions.

I worry a lot (Strongly Agree), so the ad's negative consequences could play into that anxiety. However, I don't have an active imagination or original ideas, so the ad needs to be clear and direct to appeal to me. The fear of tiredness and looking dull is straightforward, which might make it effective.

Looking at the questions:

1. Do I like the ad? It's straightforward but maybe a bit fear-based, which could turn me off. Maybe a 3.
2. Is it interesting? It presents a problem clearly, so maybe a 4.
3. Is it good? I'm not sure; it might be effective but relies on fear, so a 3.
4. Is it attractive? Not really, because of the negative approach, so maybe a 2.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Probably not, since I'm more about basic needs unless convinced. Maybe a 2.
2. Try to buy? Might consider if others recommend it, perhaps a 3.
3. Consider buying? Possibly, if the ad makes me worry enough, so maybe a 4.

Wait, but I should think again. Since I’m outgoing and like socializing, looking dull could affect my interactions. The fear of looking bad might push me to try the drink, especially since it's presented as something that can prevent tiredness and improve appearance. So maybe my scores are higher than I initially thought.

Let me adjust:

1. Like: Maybe 4 because it addresses a real concern.
2. Interesting: 5 because it clearly states the problem.
3. Good: 4, effective but relies on fear.
4. Attractive: 3, not very appealing visually or emotionally.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: 5, if I believe in its benefits.
2. Try: 6, might seek it out after seeing the ad.
3. Consider: 5, thinking about it as a possible purchase.

Hmm, but I'm still not sure. Maybe I should balance between fear and trust. Since I worry a lot, the negative outcome is persuasive, making me more likely to consider the product. So perhaps higher scores for purchase intention.

Finalizing:

Ad attitude: [4,5,4,3]
Purchase intention: [5,6,5]
