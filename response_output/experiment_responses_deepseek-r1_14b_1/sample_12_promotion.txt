Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my evaluations for both the ad's attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The advertisement focuses on staying energized and looking good, which are positive messages. However, considering my personality traits, particularly being strongly disagreeable towards being helpful and unselfish (which might relate to not valuing products that emphasize social image too much), I feel somewhat neutral about it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but lacks depth or a unique angle that would capture my interest more. Since I have an active imagination and originality, but here it's just generic, so it's only slightly interesting on a scale of 1-7.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: While the concept is positive, the execution seems too broad without specific benefits or emotional appeal that would strongly resonate with me. My tendency to worry a lot makes me question if such products are necessary, hence a moderate belief in its goodness.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual aspects might be appealing, but the core message doesn't align perfectly with my values or needs as much as it could. So, I'm not strongly attracted towards it.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Given that I worry a lot about health and appearance, but also have a thorough job approach (meaning I might seek more detailed information before committing), my intent is low without more evidence or personal relevance.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some curiosity, especially since the ad targets energy and appearance, which are relevant. However, without trust in the brand or more compelling reasons, it's a 3 on trying.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: I'm open to considering it, but not immediately decisive. My cautious nature makes me hold off until more information is available.
