Okay, let me try to figure out how I would respond to this advertisement. So, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to think about my background and personality traits. I'm a 30-39 year old male from China, working as a civil servant with a high income, living with my parents. My education is high school. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is pretty good.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing and sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Strongly Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree
- Generally trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Do a thorough job: Neutral
- Make plans and follow through: Neutral
- Tend to be careless: Disagree
- Get nervous easily: Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Have an active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, come up with new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree

Now, the ad is about staying energized and looking good. Since I'm in my late 30s, maybe I'm starting to feel the need for more energy or looking better. But as a civil servant, my job might be routine, so I don't know if I'm too worried about looking my best every day.

The ad seems to target people who care about their appearance and staying energized. But I'm reserved and not very trusting, which might make me skeptical of such ads. Also, since I'm strongly disagree with having an active imagination and being original, maybe the ad doesn't appeal to me as much because it's trying to be catchy or creative.

Looking at my tendency to worry a lot: I Disagree, so maybe I'm not too concerned about looking good every day. But I do get nervous easily, which is Agree, so perhaps the idea of staying energized could help with that.

On the other hand, being helpful and unselfish makes me consider things that are useful for others, but since this drink is about myself, maybe it's not as appealing unless it has social benefits.

I think the ad might be okay, but I'm not sure if it's convincing. It feels a bit generic and doesn't address specific needs I have deeply. So my attitude towards the ad would be somewhat neutral to slightly negative. 

For purchase intention, I'm on the fence. The idea of being energized is good, especially with my job, but I'm not convinced enough by the ad alone to buy it. Maybe I'll consider it if someone else recommends it, so 'consider' is a 4 out of 7.
