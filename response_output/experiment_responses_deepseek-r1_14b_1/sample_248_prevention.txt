Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I'm evaluating an ad that says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My demographic is a Chinese woman over 60 with a high school education, who's divorced, earns between 36-45 million VND monthly, and has certain personality traits.

Starting with my attitude toward the advertisement. I need to score how much I like it (1-7). The ad seems targeted at making people feel tired and dull without the drink, which might appeal to someone looking for energy or wanting to look good. However, being over 60, maybe I'm more concerned about health than looking youthful. Plus, I'm talkative and outgoing but also reserved sometimes. The ad's message is a bit negative, implying that without the product, you'll feel bad, which might not resonate with me as much since I prefer positive ads.

Next, is it interesting? The concept is clear—drink to avoid feeling tired—but I'm not sure if it's compelling enough. It's straightforward but lacks a unique angle or emotional appeal. So maybe around 4 on interest.

Is the ad good? Quality-wise, it depends on execution. If it's well-made with good visuals, it could be better, but without knowing more, I'll rate it lower, perhaps a 5.

Attractiveness is about how appealing it is visually and emotionally. Since the message is a bit negative and may not align with my values of helpfulness and trust, I might find it less attractive. Maybe a 3 here.

Moving to purchase intention: Do I intend to buy? The ad focuses on tiredness and appearance, which might not be top priorities for me. My income is high, but maybe I prefer more traditional products or have other brands in mind. So, lower intent—perhaps a 4.

Will I try to buy it? If the product is marketed well elsewhere, I might consider it, but based solely on this ad, it's not persuasive enough. Maybe a 3.

Consider buying: It's possible if the product has other benefits or positive reviews, but the ad alone doesn't convince me. So a middle score like 4.

Overall, my scores would reflect a somewhat neutral to slightly negative attitude toward the ad and moderate consideration for purchase.
