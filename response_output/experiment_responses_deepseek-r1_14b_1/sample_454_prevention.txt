Alright, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman in my late thirties. Let's break it down.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." That seems to be targeting people who are looking for an energy boost or want to appear more alert. Since I’m a civil servant living with parents, maybe juggling work and family can make me feel tired sometimes. The idea of feeling tired resonates because my job might be stressful.

The ad is suggesting that without the drink, I’d not only feel tired but also look dull. That’s interesting because it combines physical energy with appearance, which could appeal to someone concerned about both their well-being and how they present themselves. But does this make me like the ad? Hmm, maybe not entirely. The message feels a bit negative—focusing on what I might lose without the product. It's more of a prevention angle rather than promotion.

I'm a bit reserved, so ads that are too pushy or fear-inducing might turn me off. This ad uses scare tactics, which I strongly disagree with. However, the idea of being thorough (which I agree with) makes me consider the product's effectiveness. But trust-wise, I strongly disagree, so if the ad isn't trustworthy, it affects my belief in the product.

Looking at purchase intention: Would I intend to buy this drink? Maybe not immediately because there are other options and I’d want more evidence of its benefits. Trying it—I might be hesitant since I don’t feel a strong need right now. Considering buying it—perhaps if others recommend it or if I see positive reviews, but the ad alone doesn't convince me.

So, my attitude towards the ad is somewhat neutral to disagreeable because of the negative approach and lack of trust. My purchase intentions are low because the ad doesn’t create a compelling enough reason for me to act.
