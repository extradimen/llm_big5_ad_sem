 Here is a sample output for the given advertisement:

{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}

For this ad, my attitude towards it is moderate. I find the ad interesting and good, but not very attractive. As for purchase intention, I would consider buying the product if it is available at a reasonable price and provides sufficient benefits to justify the cost.
