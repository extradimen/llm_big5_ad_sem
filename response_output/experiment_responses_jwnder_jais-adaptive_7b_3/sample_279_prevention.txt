 Here's a sample output for the given scenario:\n\n{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 3, 5, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}\nIn this output, I have rated the ad as being interesting and attractive, but not particularly good. I am also not very interested in purchasing the product myself, so my scores for purchase intention are low. Note that these are just examples, and your own responses may vary depending on how you interpret the questions and what factors are most important to you when evaluating an ad.
