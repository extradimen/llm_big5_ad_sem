 Here's an example response from the virtual assistant:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [1,2,3,4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [5,6,7]
}

This response indicates that the virtual assistant likes and finds the ad interesting, believes it's good, and thinks it's attractive. However, they do not intend to purchase the product right away but will consider buying it in the future.
