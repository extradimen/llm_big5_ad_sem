 The ad type is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, I will assume it is an advertisement for a product or service.\nThe JSON output format has some errors and missing values that need to be fixed:\n{  "ad_type": "prevention",  "ad_attitude_scores": [like, interesting, good, attractive],  "purchase_intention_scores": [intend, try, consider] }\nThe ad type should be specified in the JSON output format.\nThe ad attitude scores should be a list of integers, representing the user's feelings towards the ad, ranging from -1 (strongly disagree) to +1 (strongly agree).\nThe purchase intention scores should also be a list of integers, representing the user's intention to buy the product or service, ranging from -1 (not at all likely) to +1 (very likely).
