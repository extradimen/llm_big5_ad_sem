 The advertisement is very simple and does not provide enough information to make a decision about the product. It might be helpful for people who are already interested in the drink, but it won't persuade me to buy it. 
I give low scores because I think that this ad lacks credibility. I don't trust advertisements and find them often unreliable or manipulative. Therefore, my attitude toward this ad is negative (1), and I do not intend to purchase the product (3).
