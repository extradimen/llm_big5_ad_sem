 Here's an example of how you could structure your response in JSON format:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
In this example, the ad type is "prevention" and your scores range from a low of 4 (disagree) to a high of 7 (strongly agree). Similarly, you have a purchase intention score of 3 (consider), with a lower score being disagreement (1) and a higher score being agreement (7).

Remember that it's important to be honest and critical when evaluating the ad. The scores should reflect your personal feelings towards the advertisement, even if they don't align perfectly with your demographic profile or personality traits.
