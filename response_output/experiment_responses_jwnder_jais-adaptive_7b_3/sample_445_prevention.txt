 As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions. However, based on the information provided, here's my evaluation:

First, the ad type is "prevention". In this case, it refers to preventing feeling tired and looking dull through using a specific product. Since everyone has different lifestyles and preferences, it may or may not be relevant for some people. However, I believe that for those who lead busy lives with little time to rest and maintain their appearance, such an ad can be quite appealing as they can relate to the message and understand its significance.

Next, your attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad. - Disagree (2)
   The ad doesn't resonate with me because it focuses on physical appearance rather than personal well-being or mental health, which are also important aspects of life. 

2. I think the ad is interesting. - Agree (4)
   It piques my curiosity and makes me want to learn more about the product's benefits and features, but it doesn't necessarily make me want to buy it.

3. I believe the ad is good. - Neutral (3)
   The quality of an ad depends on its effectiveness in conveying its message and its ability to engage viewers. It seems to do a decent job, but more information about the product would be helpful to form a strong belief in it.

4. I find the ad attractive. - Disagree (1)
   The focus on physical appearance doesn't make me want to buy the product. I prefer ads that promote products with health benefits or features that can improve my life in some way rather than just improving my looks.

Second, your purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - Neutral (3)
   While I find the ad interesting and the product appealing, there are other factors to consider such as price, availability, and personal preferences that would determine whether or not I will buy it.

2. I will try to buy this product. - Agree (4)
   Since the ad has piqued my interest, I might try the product out to see if it lives up to its claims. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that I will end up buying it.

3. I will consider buying this product. - Disagree (2)
   While the ad has caught my attention, there are other factors such as price and personal preference that would determine whether or not I consider buying it.
