 Here's how I would rate the ad:

**Ad type: Prevention**

- **Ad attitude scores:**
	1. Like - 3 (Neutral)
	2. Interesting - 5 (Agree)
	3. Good - 7 (Strongly Agree)
	4. Attractive - 6 (Agree)

As a managerial employee who is talkative and outgoing, I find the ad to be interesting and good but not as attractive. The drink being advertised claims to prevent feeling tired and looking dull, which is definitely appealing to someone like me who is always on the go and active socially. However, it doesn't resonate with me enough to make me want to buy it immediately or consider it a top priority.

**Purchase intention scores:**
1. Intend - 3 (Neutral)
2. Try - 4 (Agree)
3. Consider - 5 (Agree)

Although I find the ad interesting and good, my purchase intention is moderate. While I might try to buy the drink at some point, it's not a top priority for me right now. There are other health-related products that I believe would be more beneficial to me in terms of my lifestyle and personal preferences. However, if I were to change my mind or find myself in need of this product, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it.
