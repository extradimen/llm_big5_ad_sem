 The ad is trying to promote a drink that can help you feel less tired and dull. However, as an older individual with a postgraduate degree, I have enough energy and focus without needing any assistance from the product in question. 

I believe the product's advertising claims are exaggerated and not credible. Additionally, I find the ad to be manipulative rather than interesting or attractive.

Therefore, my attitude towards this ad is negative and my purchase intention is low. Hence, the corresponding scores would be:

ad_type: prevention
ad_attitude_scores: [1, 2, 3, 4]
purchase_intention_scores: [5, 6, 7]
