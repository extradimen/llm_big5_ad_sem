 The given prompt is incomplete and does not include all of the questions that need to be answered. Based on the information provided, I would rate the ad as follows:

Attitude toward the advertisement: 2 (Interesting)
Purchase intention: 3 (Consider)

The reason for this is that the advertisement does not directly appeal to me as a consumer in my demographic profile. While it might be effective for some people, I do not find it particularly compelling or relevant to my needs and interests. Therefore, while I think it's interesting and well-crafted, I don't plan on purchasing the product based on this advertisement alone.
