 Here's an example of how I would answer these questions as a virtual assistant:

First, your attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad. (7)
2. I think the ad is interesting. (6)
3. I believe the ad is good. (5)
4. I find the ad attractive. (4)

Second, your purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product. (6)
2. I will try to buy this product. (5)
3. I will consider buying this product. (4)

And here's how these scores would be represented in a JSON format:

{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [6, 5, 4]
}
