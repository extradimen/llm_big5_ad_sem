 I do not think the ad is interesting. In fact, it is a little annoying and makes me feel like I need to drink this product in order to be "good" or healthy. The ad reminds me of some scammy commercials that I have seen on TV before.

However, I may consider buying this product because my friend recommended it to me. My friend said the product tastes good and helps with energy levels. But I am not sure if I will end up buying it or not. I think I will try it for a while, but I don't know if I will continue using it.

Overall, I think this is a bad ad because it makes me feel like I need to drink the product in order to be healthy. It also reminds me of some scammy commercials that I have seen on TV before.
