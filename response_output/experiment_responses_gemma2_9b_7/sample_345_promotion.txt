**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and lacks something to truly capture my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product based on the ad. It appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or reviews.  I might consider buying it if I see it on sale or hear positive feedback from others.
