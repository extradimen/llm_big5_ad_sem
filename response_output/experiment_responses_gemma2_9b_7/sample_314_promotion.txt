Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention strongly or make a lasting impression. It feels a bit generic.  I wouldn't call it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to be careful, I'm not immediately inclined to purchase the product. However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try it if I see it in the store or receive a discount. I would consider buying it based on its claims but wouldn't actively seek it out. 


Essentially, this ad doesn't strongly appeal to me emotionally, but it presents a proposition I could potentially be interested in exploring further.
