**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its direct approach, I don't necessarily think it's "good" or that I *like* it in a positive way. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad sparks my interest enough that I'd likely try the product.  However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it. As a student with a comfortable income, I'm selective about trying new things and would need more convincing information about its benefits before committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
