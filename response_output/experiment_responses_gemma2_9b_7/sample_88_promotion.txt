**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about energy and looking your best are common in this type of advertising and don't feel unique or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product based on the advertisement.  I am interested enough to give it a shot, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or trying it myself. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
