**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets the point across, I don't find it particularly engaging or memorable. 
    * **Like:** 3 -  It's not bad, just not something I'd go out of my way to remember.
    * **Interesting:** 2 - The concept of staying energized and looking good is relevant, but the ad doesn't present anything new or exciting.
    * **Good:** 2 - It effectively communicates its message, but lacks creativity.
    * **Attractive:** 1 -  The simplicity might work for some, but I personally prefer ads with more visual appeal or a compelling story.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because my job requires me to be energized and put-together, the product's benefits are appealing. However, I'd need more information before making a decision.
    * **Intend:** 1 -  I'm curious enough to try it.
    * **Try:** 1 -  I'd likely purchase a single bottle to see if it works for me.
    * **Consider:** 2 - I would definitely consider buying it again if I found it effective and affordable.
