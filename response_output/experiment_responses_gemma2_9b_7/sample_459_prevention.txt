**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it might be effective for some people, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (I tend to be careful and not easily influenced by advertising), and because the ad relies on fear-based tactics, I'm more likely to consider purchasing this product after doing thorough research and perhaps trying a sample.  It doesn't immediately grab me as something I need or want based solely on this ad.
