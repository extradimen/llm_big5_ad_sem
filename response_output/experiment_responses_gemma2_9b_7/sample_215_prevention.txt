**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language used is quite common in this type of advertising and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. However, my worry level (which is high) makes me hesitant to commit to a purchase without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects. I might try it if I see it on sale or as part of a promotional offer.  


Let me know if you have any other questions!
