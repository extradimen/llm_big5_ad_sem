**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims about energy and looks aren't very compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because it might help with my nervousness (although I doubt it). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would need to see more information or reviews before making a decision. I'm not one to make impulsive purchases. 


My personality traits like being reserved, trusting but sometimes rude, careless, and prone to nervousness likely influence my response. I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims and prefer to research products thoroughly before buying them.
