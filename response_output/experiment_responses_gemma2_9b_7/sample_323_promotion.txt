**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not dislikeful, the ad doesn't grab my attention in a particularly exciting way. It's straightforward and functional. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that piques my interest somewhat.  I value practicality.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad, clear in its message, but not particularly memorable or compelling.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or stimulating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually buy this drink if I see it at a store and am looking for a pick-me-up. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm open to trying new things, especially if they claim to help with energy or appearance.
    * **Consider (3):**  While I wouldn't actively seek out this drink, I'd give it consideration if the price is right and I'm in need of a boost.
