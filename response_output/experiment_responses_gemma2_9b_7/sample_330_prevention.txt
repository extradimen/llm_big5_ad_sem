**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product (2) if I saw it on sale or heard good reviews, but I wouldn't actively seek it out (1).  I'd definitely consider buying it (3) depending on the price and other factors like taste or availability of alternatives.
