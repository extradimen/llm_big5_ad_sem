**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "like-able" or "attractive", it does pique my interest because of the promise of energy and looking good.  I think it's a decent advertisement, but not something that would stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *slightly* more likely to purchase this product. I wouldn't immediately run out and buy it, but if I were in the market for an energy drink or looking for ways to improve my appearance, this ad might influence my decision to try it.  I'm still hesitant though due to my general distrustfulness and tendency to worry.   



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
