**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't appeal to my preference for more subtle advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying the product because of the potential benefit it promises, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement.  My decision would likely depend on further research, reviews, and perhaps personal recommendations. 




Let me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like me to evaluate!
