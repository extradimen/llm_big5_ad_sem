  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Here's why I gave these scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is clear and to the point, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It relies on common claims without offering any specific details or unique selling points. The "look your best" aspect feels a bit superficial. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try the product because I'm generally open to new things and the ad promises energy, which could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further information about its ingredients, taste, and effectiveness. I would need more convincing before considering it a regular part of my routine.
