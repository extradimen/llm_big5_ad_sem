**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit too dramatic and doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product:  I might be tempted if the drink seems genuinely beneficial and aligns with my health goals.
    * I will try to buy this product: This is a more likely scenario as I'm open to trying new things, especially if they promise a positive effect.
    * I will consider buying this product: Given the ad's focus on avoiding negative consequences ("tired" and "dull"), it might make me consider it depending on other factors like taste and price. 


**Overall:** The ad piques my curiosity but doesn't strongly convince me to buy.  I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and potential drawbacks before making a decision.
