**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it speaks to a desire for feeling energized and looking good. While it's not bad, I don't personally find it very attractive (1) or believe it's particularly good (2).  I like the message enough to find it interesting, but it doesn't grab me strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I tend to be agreeable and trustworthy (as indicated in my personality traits), I might be inclined to give this product a try (1) based on the ad alone.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (1). Before buying, I'd want more information about the ingredients and how effective it really is. I would consider buying it (2) if friends recommended it or if I saw positive reviews. 


Let me know if you'd like me to evaluate another ad!
