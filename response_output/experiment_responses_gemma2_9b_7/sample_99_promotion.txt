**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my lukewarm feelings towards the ad, I might actually *try* this product. I'm always looking for ways to improve my well-being, and the promise of increased energy and better appearance is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it without more information or a stronger appeal.  The "consider" score reflects that I'd need to see more details or testimonials before making a firm decision.
