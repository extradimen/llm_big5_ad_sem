**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic which I'm not overly fond of.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider buying the product because it appeals to my desire to avoid feeling tired and looking dull.  I might even try it, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
