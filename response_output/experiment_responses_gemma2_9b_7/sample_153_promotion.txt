**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing (score of 6), it's not something that truly captivates me. I find it interesting enough (5) and decent overall (4). However,  I wouldn't call it particularly attractive (3). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Although the ad is mildly positive, it doesn't strongly influence my purchase decision. I might give the product a try (score of 2), but I wouldn't actively intend to buy it (1) or seriously consider it (0).  The ad lacks specifics about what makes this drink effective, and as someone who values thoroughness (strongly agree), I'd need more convincing information.
