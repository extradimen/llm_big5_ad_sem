**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Even though I don't love the ad,  I might try the product out of curiosity or if it was conveniently available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
