Here's why I scored it that way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common persuasive language, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. It relies on generic claims about energy and appearance which don't feel unique or compelling.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I tend to be "talkative" and enjoy discussing new products, I might be inclined to try this drink based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it right away. I would likely want to hear more about its ingredients and perhaps see reviews before making a final decision.
