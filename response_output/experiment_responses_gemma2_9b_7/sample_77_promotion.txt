**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in advertising and don't stand out to me.  

My purchase intention is influenced by these factors:

* **Helpfulness:** I generally try to be helpful and unselfish, so if this drink genuinely helped people feel their best, I might consider buying it.
* **Planning:** I like to make plans and follow through. If the ad provided specific benefits or a plan for achieving those benefits, it would increase my consideration.

However, the ad lacks details about the product's ingredients or how it actually works. This makes me hesitant to purchase it without further information.
