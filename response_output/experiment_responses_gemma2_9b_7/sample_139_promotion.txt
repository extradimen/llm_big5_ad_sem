**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):**  It's a simple message that gets the point across. I find it appealing enough.
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is something I can relate to. 
    * **Good (3):** It's clear and straightforward, but not overly complicated or gimmicky.
    * **Attractive (2):**  It's not particularly flashy or eye-catching, but it does grab my attention enough to read it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'd likely try this drink based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (2):**  I'm more inclined to buy it after seeing the ad than before.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad definitely makes me think about trying this drink, but I'd probably research more about it before making a decision.
