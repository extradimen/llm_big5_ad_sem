**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys its message clearly, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate strongly with me. However, I find it interesting enough to pay attention to. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity, and I might consider trying the drink if it's presented well in-store or recommended by someone I trust.  I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this ad alone.
