**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement, I don't personally find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day is somewhat vague and doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I'm likely to consider buying the product if it catches my eye in a store or if I see positive reviews from others, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
