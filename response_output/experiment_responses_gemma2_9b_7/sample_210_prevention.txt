**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), I find it interesting because it plays on common insecurities. However,  I don't particularly like it because it feels manipulative and relies on making me feel bad about myself. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about the product, so I might try it out of curiosity. I wouldn't actively intend to buy it based solely on this ad though, as I find it unconvincing.  I would consider buying it if there were other positive reviews or factors influencing my decision.
