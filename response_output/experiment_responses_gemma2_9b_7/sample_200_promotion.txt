**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall (scores of 3 and 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product (score of 1 for "try"). I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright (score of 1 for "intend"), but I could consider it if I saw it again or had a specific need for an energy boost (score of 3 for "consider"). 


My personality traits, like being reserved and sometimes rude, mean I'm not easily swayed by typical advertising.  I also tend to be cautious and worry, so claims about looking your best every day feel a bit exaggerated.
