**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about the product. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very persuasive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. It depends on other factors like price, availability, and reviews. I would consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if there was a compelling reason to try it.
