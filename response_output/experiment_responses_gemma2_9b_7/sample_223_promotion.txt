**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its simplicity and focus on positive outcomes (energy and appearance), I don't think it's inherently "good" or that I strongly like it.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who is talkative, outgoing, and likes new ideas, I might be persuaded by the ad. The promise of feeling energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to be sociable and put my best foot forward. However, because I'm also cautious (disagreeing with being generally trusting) and worry a lot, I wouldn't immediately buy it without further research or perhaps recommendations from someone I trust.
