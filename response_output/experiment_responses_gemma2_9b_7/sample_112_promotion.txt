**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent in its presentation, I don't particularly "like" it or find it highly attractive. The claims feel a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the claims of staying energized and looking good appeal to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from people like me. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or a good deal.
