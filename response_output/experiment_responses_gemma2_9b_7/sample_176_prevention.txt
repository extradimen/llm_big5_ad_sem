**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me visually or emotionally. The "prevention" message feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about looking tired and dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad alone because I'm generally trusting and open to new things. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it.  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
