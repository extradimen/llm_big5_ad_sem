**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it speaks to a desire for feeling energized and looking good. However, it's not particularly captivating or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that might appeal to many people, including myself. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly enough, but it lacks creativity or a strong emotional connection.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and message don't particularly draw me in visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the product because feeling energized is something I value, but I wouldn't be actively seeking it out based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be willing to try the product if I came across it at a convenient time and place, perhaps with a good offer or promotion. 
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from people I trust, my consideration level would increase.



My personality traits like being reserved, careful, and worrying a lot make me less impulsive in purchasing decisions.  I need more information and reassurance before making a commitment to buying something new.
