**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull), it lacks creativity and feels somewhat generic. I don't find it particularly attractive or well-made.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially try the product, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it. My final decision would depend on further research, reviews, and perhaps a physical experience with the drink itself. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
