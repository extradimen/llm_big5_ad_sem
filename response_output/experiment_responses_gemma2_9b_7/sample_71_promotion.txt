**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting, I wouldn't say I particularly like it. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't resonate strongly with me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product. My personality leans towards being trusting and I'm often careless, so a simple claim like this could sway me to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't be overly committed to purchasing it based solely on this ad.  I would likely need more information or see reviews before making a definite decision.
