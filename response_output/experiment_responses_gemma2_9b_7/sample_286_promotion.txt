**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The language feels a bit generic and lacks specifics about what makes this drink unique. However, it is well-constructed and presents a clear benefit. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because I like the idea of feeling more energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make it a regular purchase without trying it first and seeing if it delivers on its promise.
