**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on my concern about looking good and feeling energetic. However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable (2), attractive (1), or believe it's objectively a "good" advertisement (2). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider buying the product (3) because it appeals to my desire to look and feel my best. I'm not ready to buy it immediately (1) but would likely try it (1) if the opportunity arose. The potential for feeling tired and dull is a concern, so I might give the drink a shot.
