**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, I find it interesting (3) and believe it's decent (1). The message is straightforward and appeals to common desires for energy and appearance. However, it lacks creativity or a strong hook to make me truly enthusiastic about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I *intend* to purchase this product (1) because the claim of increased energy aligns with my tendency to plan and follow through.  I'm willing to try products that can help me stay productive. 
    * I will also *try* to buy this product (1) since the ad piqued my curiosity. 
    * However, I might not necessarily *consider* it a top choice (3). My relatively high income means I likely have access to other options, and without further information about ingredients or effectiveness, I wouldn't prioritize it over well-established brands.
