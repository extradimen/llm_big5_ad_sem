**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of "tired and dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it. I'm also hesitant because the ad doesn't provide any concrete information about what's in the drink or how it works. The focus on negative feelings ("tired," "dull") without offering a positive solution is off-putting.
