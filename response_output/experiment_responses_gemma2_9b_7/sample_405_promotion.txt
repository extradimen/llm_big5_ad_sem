**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and don't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to intend to purchase this product and will definitely try it at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it regularly without more specific information about its ingredients or benefits that appeal to me personally. 


My reserved personality means I'm cautious about trying new things, but the promise of energy and looking good is appealing. The ad needs to be more persuasive to solidify my intention to become a regular customer.
