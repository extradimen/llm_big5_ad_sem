**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  The ad is simple and gets the point across. I'm not particularly fond of it, but it doesn't bother me.
    * **Interesting (3):** It piques my curiosity enough to make me think about it.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear tactics ("tired and dull") to motivate a response. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying the drink, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** If I saw the drink available, I might be tempted to try it once.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me think about trying the product, but I need more information or a stronger appeal before making a decision. 



As someone who values being practical and reliable ("make plans and follow through with them"),  this ad relies on fear tactics rather than providing concrete benefits. My preference for straightforwardness might make me skeptical of claims like "without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." I'd need more evidence or a clearer explanation of how the product works to be truly convinced.
