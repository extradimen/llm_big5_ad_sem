Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim feels a bit exaggerated and relies on creating fear (feeling tired and dull). 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of the way the ad is structured, it does pique my interest enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a purchase decision without further research or seeing real testimonials.  


As someone who values doing thorough work and tends to be careful, I'd want more information before committing to buying something based solely on an ad that uses fear tactics.
