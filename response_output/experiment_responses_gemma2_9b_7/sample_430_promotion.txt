**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't personally like it. It doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel very attractive to me.  I'm not easily swayed by general claims about energy and looks.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me *try* this product because of the promise of energy, which could be appealing given my tendency to get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately, and I would definitely consider other factors before making a decision. 


My reserved personality and preference for carefully planning things mean I wouldn't jump into buying something based on a simple ad.  I need more concrete information and likely some personal recommendations before taking the plunge.
