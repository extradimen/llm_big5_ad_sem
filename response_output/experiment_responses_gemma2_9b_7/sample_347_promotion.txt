Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, but not particularly attractive or something I actively like. The promise of energy and looking good is common, so it doesn't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I might consider buying this product if I see it in the store and am feeling tempted, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My monthly income suggests I have access to a variety of products, but this ad doesn't really convince me of its unique value.   



Let me know if you want more detail about any particular score!
