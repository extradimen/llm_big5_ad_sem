**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting because it speaks to common desires for energy and appearance, I don't find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims are fairly general and don't stand out as unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because I value being energized and looking my best. However,  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more specific information about the ingredients and benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it if reviews were positive or if there was a promotion. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
