**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" framing feels a bit manipulative, playing on my worry (which is high) without offering concrete solutions.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my worry and tendency to be thorough, I might consider trying this product if the claims are backed by evidence. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. I need more information before making a decision.
