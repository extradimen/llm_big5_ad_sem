**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels manipulative and plays on insecurities.  Despite this,  the ad triggers a desire to try the product to potentially avoid those negative outcomes. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright, as I tend to be cautious and reserved when trying new things.
