**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance feel generic and not very compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I'd likely consider it if I saw it in a store or received a good deal on it. The fact that I worry a lot might make me hesitant about trying new things without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects.
