**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are fairly generic and don't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider other factors like price, reviews, and ingredient lists before making a final decision.
