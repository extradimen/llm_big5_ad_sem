**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.  The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" is appealing, but I'd need more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision. I'm not easily swayed by advertising and would likely research further before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
