**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly catchy or exciting, but it does grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if slightly exaggerated. It piques my curiosity about the drink's benefits.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a simple ad that conveys its message clearly. However, it lacks any strong emotional appeal or unique selling points. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based solely on this ad.  I need more information about its ingredients, taste, and effectiveness.
    * **Try (1):**  If I saw this drink readily available, I might be tempted to give it a try due to the "prevention" angle. 
    * **Consider (3):** If the price is reasonable and there are positive reviews or recommendations, I would definitely consider purchasing it. 


The ad works on a basic level by highlighting a common concern (feeling tired and dull). However, its lack of specifics and emotional appeal mean it's unlikely to strongly influence my buying decision.
