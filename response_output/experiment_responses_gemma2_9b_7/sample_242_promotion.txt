**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its simple message, I don't think it's particularly good. It relies on common marketing tropes without offering anything unique or specific.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of increased energy and looking my best appeals to me. The ad doesn't need to be incredibly convincing for me to try something that seems potentially beneficial. 



Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any of my scores!
