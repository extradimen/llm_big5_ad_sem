**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The message is pretty standard for this type of product.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad alone because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would likely consider other options or reviews before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
