This is how I arrived at these scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (1):** While the ad isn't bad, it doesn't really grab my attention. It's a common message ("energy" and "looking your best").  I'm not easily swayed by such general claims. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad is straightforward enough to hold my interest for a moment, but it doesn't spark any real curiosity.
    * **Good (3):** It's clear in its message and presents a simple idea.  
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks anything visually or conceptually appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad might lead me to think about trying this drink, but I wouldn't actively seek it out right away.
    * **Try (1):** If I happened to see this drink at the store, I might be tempted to give it a try based on the ad alone. 
    * **Consider (2):**  I would definitely consider buying it if someone recommended it or if there was a specific reason I needed an energy boost.



My personality traits like being reserved and trusting play a role here. The ad relies on general promises, which don't immediately convince me. My preference for "original ideas" means I'm less likely to be drawn in by standard marketing claims.
