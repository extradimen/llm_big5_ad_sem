**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It seems like a standard advertisement for this type of product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am currently a student and on a tight budget (despite my income), I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy this drink. However, I might be persuaded to *try* it if I see it on sale or as part of a promotion. I would definitely *consider* buying it if it became a regular part of my routine and I felt it genuinely helped me stay energized.
