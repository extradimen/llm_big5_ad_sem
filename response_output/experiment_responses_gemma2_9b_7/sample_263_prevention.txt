**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score of 3) and think it's *good* (score of 2), I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my worry about feeling tired and lacking energy (which is reflected in my personality traits), I might *intend to purchase* this product (score of 1) or at least *try it*. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it repeatedly without further research or if there were other options available.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
