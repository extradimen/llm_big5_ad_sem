**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem very attractive. The "look dull" phrase feels a bit clich√©.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying the product because it plays on my worry about feeling tired. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it. I would probably consider it if I was looking for an energy boost and saw positive reviews or recommendations. 


I'm a high school student with limited income, so price would be a major factor in my decision to buy.
