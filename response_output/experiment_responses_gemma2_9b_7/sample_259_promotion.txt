**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I think the ad is fairly interesting (4) because it promises something everyone wants: energy and looking good.  While I find it attractive enough (2), I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I definitely intend to purchase this product (1) if I see it. I'd probably even try it right away (1). However, considering buying it long-term (3) depends on things like price and how it actually works. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
