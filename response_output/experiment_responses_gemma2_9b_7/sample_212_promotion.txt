Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises something everyone wants - to feel energized and look good.  I think it's *good* but not necessarily groundbreaking. It uses typical language that appeals to those desires. The visuals probably play a big role too, though I can't judge them here.
* **Purchase Intention:** I *intend* to try this drink because the promise of feeling more energized is appealing.  Since it's likely marketed towards my age group, it feels relevant. However, I wouldn't *consider* it my top choice without trying it and seeing if it lives up to its claims.
