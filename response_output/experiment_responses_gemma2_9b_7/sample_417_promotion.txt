**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not particularly exciting but it gets its point across. The focus on "looking your best" appeals to me slightly as a sociable person who wants to make a good impression.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try this product because it claims to keep you energized, which I could use given my blue-collar work and tendency to worry. However, I wouldn't immediately jump on buying it without more information about the ingredients or trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
