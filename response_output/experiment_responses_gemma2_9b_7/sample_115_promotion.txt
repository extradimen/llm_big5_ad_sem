**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, it lacks a strong hook or unique selling point.  The language feels generic and doesn't particularly excite me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values helpfulness and doing a thorough job, I would likely research this drink further before buying. The claim of "looking your best" is subjective, so I'd want to know more about the ingredients and potential effects.  I'm open to trying it based on positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
