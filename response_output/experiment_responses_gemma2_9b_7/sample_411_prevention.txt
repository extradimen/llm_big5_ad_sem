**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on my worry about looking dull. While I wouldn't call myself "talkative" in social settings, I do care about how I'm perceived.  
    * It's not something I *like* (2) or necessarily find *good* (2) because the fear-based approach feels a bit manipulative. 
    * I don't find it particularly *attractive* (1) because it doesn't appeal to any of my more creative or imaginative sides.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I was genuinely feeling tired and self-conscious, especially if the ad offered a free trial or sample. 
    * I would definitely *try* (1) it in that situation.
    * However, I'm likely to *consider* (3) buying it long-term depending on reviews and word of mouth. My cautious nature prevents me from immediately jumping on every product advertised.
