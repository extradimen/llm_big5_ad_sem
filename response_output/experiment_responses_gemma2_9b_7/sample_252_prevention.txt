**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and relies on creating anxiety rather than highlighting positive benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because I worry about feeling tired and wanting to look my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone. I'd need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.
