**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) and think it's okay (2), I don't particularly like it (3) or find it attractive (1).  The language is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's approach, I'm hesitant to immediately buy it (1). However, I might try it once (1) out of curiosity.  I'd likely consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or heard good word-of-mouth about it. 


My personality traits make me more susceptible to social influence and recommendations from others, so testimonials or peer opinions would carry more weight with me than this ad alone.
