}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly eye-catching or "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (score of 3) and think it's a decent attempt at advertising (score of 2).  
* **Purchase Intention:** I'm leaning towards trying this product (score of 1) as the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about the ingredients or seeing testimonials (score of 1 for "try"). I would definitely consider buying it if the price was reasonable and I saw positive reviews (score of 3).  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my reasoning!
