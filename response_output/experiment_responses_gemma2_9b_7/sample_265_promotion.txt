**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and not very compelling to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because I tend to be helpful and unselfish. If someone asked me about it, I might want to give it a go and see if it lives up to its claims. However, I'm not actively planning to purchase it. The ad doesn't really resonate with my needs or priorities.
