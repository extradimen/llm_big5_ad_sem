**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* due to its clear message and attempt at creating a sense of urgency, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me *intend* to purchase this drink and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly based on this ad alone.  I'd likely want more information about the product itself before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
