**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem generic and don't really resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product because I worry about looking my best and staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more specific information about the drink's ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if a friend recommended it or if there was a good promotion.
