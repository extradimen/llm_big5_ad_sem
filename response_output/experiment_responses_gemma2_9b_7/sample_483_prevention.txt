**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. It relies on a fear tactic that doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I am generally emotionally stable and not easily swayed by these types of appeals.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend:** I might intend to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't be highly motivated to purchase it immediately based solely on this ad.
    * **Try:** I'm willing to give it a try if I see it in stores or someone recommends it.
    * **Consider:**  I would definitely consider buying it if the product had other positive reviews or if I was experiencing fatigue.
