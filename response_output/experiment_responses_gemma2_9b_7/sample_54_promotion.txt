**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* overall (2), I don't personally find it *attractive* (1).  The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't particularly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being highly drawn to the ad, I could see myself *trying* this product (1) based on the promise of energy and looking good. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it (1) right away without knowing more about its ingredients or seeing real reviews. The possibility of buying it in the future is definitely there (3). 


My personality traits, such as being agreeable and trusting, might make me more open to trying new things, especially if they promise a benefit like increased energy. However, my tendency to be nervous and worry, along with my preference for originality, mean I'd likely need more convincing than a simple advertisement.
