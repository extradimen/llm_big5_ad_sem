**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and potentially *good* due to its directness, I wouldn't call it *likeable* or *attractive*. My personality traits like being reserved, distrustful, and prone to worry might make me skeptical of such claims.  However, the fear of feeling tired and dull could motivate me to try the product at least once (hence "intend" and "try"). I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly ("consider") until I had a chance to experience its effects firsthand.
