**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. It lacks a unique hook or strong emotional appeal for me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be careless and not always meticulous in planning, I might impulsively purchase this drink if I see it while shopping.  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a conscious decision to buy it based solely on this advertisement. The claim of "looking your best" doesn't resonate with me strongly, as I have few artistic interests and prioritize functionality over outward appearance.
