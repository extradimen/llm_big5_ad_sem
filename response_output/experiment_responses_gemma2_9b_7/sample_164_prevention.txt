**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). While it's interesting because it plays on insecurities about appearance and energy,  I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (somewhat trusting but also prone to worry), the ad might plant a seed of doubt in me about my current state. I might be inclined to *try* the product to alleviate those worries, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly.  There's a chance I would *consider* buying it if I was feeling particularly susceptible to its message.
