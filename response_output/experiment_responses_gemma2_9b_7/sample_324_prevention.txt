**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product because I worry a lot (as reflected in my personality) and the idea of feeling less tired is appealing. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it or try it right away.
