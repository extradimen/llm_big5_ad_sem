**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad pretty appealing (score of 4 for "like"), it's not groundbreaking or particularly interesting (score of 3 for "interesting").  I think it gets its point across well (score of 2 for "good") and looks decent, but nothing spectacular (score of 3 for "attractive").

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm likely to buy this product (score of 1 for "intend"). The promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing to me. However, I might try it first before committing to a full purchase (score of 2 for "try").  Overall, I'd consider buying it if I saw it in the store (score of 3 for "consider").
