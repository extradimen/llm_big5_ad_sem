**Explanation:**

While I find the ad to be interesting and somewhat attractive because it promises a benefit (energy and good looks), I don't love it. My personality leans towards being "careless" and "talkative," so I might not pay much attention to advertising in general.  I'm also someone who likes concrete information about products rather than vague claims. 

My purchase intention is driven by the possibility of the drink helping me feel energized, as I tend to get nervous easily and need that extra boost sometimes. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it â€“ I'd want to know more about its ingredients and see if there are any reviews from people like me.
