**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear rather than positive messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be persuaded to try the product, given the right circumstances (like seeing a friend enjoy it or finding it at a good price). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this ad. The claim about feeling tired and dull feels vague and doesn't strongly resonate with my personal experiences.
