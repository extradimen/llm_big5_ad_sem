**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message is a bit straightforward and lacks creativity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or perhaps seeing a more compelling advertisement. 



As someone who values thoroughness and tends to be reserved, I would likely want more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
