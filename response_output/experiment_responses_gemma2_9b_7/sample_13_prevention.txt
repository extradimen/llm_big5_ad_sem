**Explanation:**

This ad relies on fear and insecurity ("you may feel tired and look dull").  As a reserved individual who gets nervous easily and tends to worry less about external appearances, this message doesn't resonate with me. I find the ad slightly interesting because it tries to tap into those anxieties, but I wouldn't consider buying the product.
