**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at being persuasive, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common tropes that don't particularly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product due to the "look your best" aspect, which might appeal to me based on a desire to improve my appearance (despite being reserved). I would also *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly unless it significantly impressed me after trying it.  


My personality traits of being reserved and worrying a lot might make me hesitant to fully trust advertising claims, even if they seem appealing.
