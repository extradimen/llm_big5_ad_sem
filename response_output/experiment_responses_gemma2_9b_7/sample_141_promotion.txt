{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I wouldn't call it "likeable" or "attractive".**  The language is fairly generic and doesn't really grab my attention. As someone who values originality, I need something more unique to pique my interest.

* **My purchase intention is high because I do appreciate a good energy boost and staying healthy is important to me.** However, the ad doesn't provide any specific details about the drink's ingredients or benefits, so I would need to do further research before making a decision.
