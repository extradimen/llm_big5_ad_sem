**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing enough (scores of 3 or higher), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product (score of 2). It piques my interest because I value staying energized, but I wouldn't necessarily rush to buy it without further research or seeing testimonials.  I might try the product if it was offered at a discount or as part of a sample pack.
