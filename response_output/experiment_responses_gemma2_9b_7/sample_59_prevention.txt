**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common fear (looking dull) and promises a solution. While I don't think it's exceptionally well-made or attractive, it does pique my curiosity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad appeals to me slightly. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would probably consider other options and read reviews before making a decision. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who values new ideas and is somewhat imaginative, I'm more likely to be drawn to ads that promise something novel or unique. This ad relies on a common fear (looking tired/dull) rather than highlighting any special features of the drink.  While I find it interesting enough to try, my cautious nature means I wouldn't commit to purchasing without further research.
