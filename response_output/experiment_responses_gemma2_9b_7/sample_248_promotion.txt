Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** The ad is straightforward and uses simple language I can understand. It also speaks to two things that are important to me - energy and appearance. While it's not particularly creative or exciting, it does grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I like the idea of a drink that could help me feel more energetic throughout the day.  Given my busy work schedule, that would be beneficial. I'm likely to try it at least once. However, I'd need to see more details about the ingredients and read reviews before committing to regular purchases.
