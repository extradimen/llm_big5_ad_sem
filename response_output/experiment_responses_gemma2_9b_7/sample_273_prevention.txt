**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink..."). My distrust of advertising makes me less receptive to these claims.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to purchase the product because the ad plays on my worry about looking dull, and I tend to be agreeable. However,  I'm not immediately rushing to buy it. The ad might make me *try* it, but I'll likely only *consider* buying it after seeing other opinions or trying a sample.
