**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance feel a bit generic and not very compelling to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of increased energy might be helpful. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.  Considering buying it depends on factors like price, availability, and positive reviews from others I trust.
