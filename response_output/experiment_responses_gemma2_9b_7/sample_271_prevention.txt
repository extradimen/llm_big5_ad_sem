**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "likeable" in my opinion, it does pique my interest. I find the implied warning about feeling tired and dull intriguing because these are things that  could affect my performance at work. I'd consider it a "good" ad in terms of grabbing attention. However, I wouldn't call it "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying this product. I might even intend to buy it if I see it readily available.  However, I'm not fully convinced yet and would need more information about the product before making a firm decision.
