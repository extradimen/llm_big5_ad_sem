**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than positive messaging. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would consider buying it if there were positive reviews or if I was experiencing fatigue and looking for a quick solution. However, my preference would be to address the root cause of tiredness rather than relying on a drink as a fix.
