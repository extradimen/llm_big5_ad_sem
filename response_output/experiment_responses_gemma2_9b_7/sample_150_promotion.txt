  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't call it "likeable," the ad is interesting because it promises something useful (staying energized) and appealing (looking your best). I think it's a decent ad overall. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to buy this product.  The promises of energy and looking good appeal to me, especially since I'm relatively young and working a blue-collar job that can be physically demanding.
