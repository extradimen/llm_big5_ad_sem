**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and *good* (2) in its simplicity and directness, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1). It relies on a bit of fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't appeal to my preference for avoiding strong emotional appeals.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase (1) and *try* this product (1) out of curiosity, especially if I was experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness. However, given my tendency to worry and my reserved nature, I would probably *consider* buying (3) it cautiously and not make a rash decision.  The ad doesn't provide enough information about the drink's ingredients or benefits to sway me definitively.
