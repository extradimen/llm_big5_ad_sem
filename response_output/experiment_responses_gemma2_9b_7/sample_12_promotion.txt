**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It lacks a unique selling proposition or compelling visuals that would make it stand out. However, I find it interesting because it speaks to common desires for energy and appearance enhancement. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Given my income level and the ad's general message, I might be inclined to try this drink.  I'm always looking for ways to improve my energy levels and appearance, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or a more enticing offer.
