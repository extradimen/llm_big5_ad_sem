**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly exciting or captivating, but it does pique my curiosity.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The "tired and dull" message resonates as something I might be concerned about, especially given my managerial role where energy and appearance are important.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, direct message that gets the point across. Not groundbreaking, but effective in its simplicity. 
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad is not visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I am likely to try this drink based on the ad alone. It addresses a potential concern and I'm generally open to new products.
    * **Try (1):**  My intention is high, so I would definitely give it a shot. 
    * **Consider (2):** While I'm leaning towards trying it, I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase without more information about its taste and effectiveness.
