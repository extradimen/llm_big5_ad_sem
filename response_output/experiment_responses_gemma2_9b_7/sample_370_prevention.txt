**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I don't personally find it very appealing or attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be tempted to try the product, especially if it was offered at a discount or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
