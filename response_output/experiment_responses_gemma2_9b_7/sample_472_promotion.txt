Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good.  I think it's decent (2) overall but not particularly compelling or memorable. While "looking your best" is appealing, the ad doesn't really explain how the drink achieves that. 

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm likely to try this product (1) because I'm always open to trying new things, especially if they promise energy. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1).  I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing. I will consider buying it (3) if others recommend it or if there is a good deal. 


My personality traits like being "careless" and having an "active imagination" might make me more susceptible to trying new things, but my cautious nature ("strongly disagree" with trusting others) means I need more convincing before making a purchase.
