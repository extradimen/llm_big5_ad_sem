**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity. I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if given the opportunity (e.g., free sample), I would give it a go. However, I wouldn't intend to purchase it regularly based solely on this advertisement. 


My personality traits like being reserved and distrustful, combined with my tendency to worry and  a preference for original thinking, make me less susceptible to direct appeals that try to create fear or insecurity.
