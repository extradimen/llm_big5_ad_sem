**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I like the ad.**  The ad's message relies on fear ("feel tired and look dull") which doesn't appeal to me. I tend to be more motivated by positive outcomes rather than avoiding negative ones. 
    * **2 (Disagree) - I think the ad is interesting.** While not particularly likeable, the straightforwardness of the message is somewhat intriguing. It's simple and gets its point across quickly.
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I believe the ad is good.** The ad lacks depth and relies on a generalized fear without offering any specifics about the product's benefits. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I find the ad attractive.**  The ad's design and imagery are likely not memorable or particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I intend to purchase this product.** Based on my personality, I'm unlikely to be swayed by fear-based advertising. 
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I will try to buy this product.**  I need more information about the product and its benefits before considering trying it. 
    * **2 (Disagree) - I will consider buying this product.** If, in a specific situation, I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance, I *might* consider this product as a temporary solution.
