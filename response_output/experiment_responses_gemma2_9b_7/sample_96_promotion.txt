Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because the idea of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would likely consider trying it based on other factors like reviews or recommendations from friends before making a decision. 


As someone who tends to be careless and doesn't always do a thorough job, I might not pay close attention to the ingredients or nutritional information of this drink.  My decision ultimately hinges on whether I perceive the product as beneficial and worth trying.
