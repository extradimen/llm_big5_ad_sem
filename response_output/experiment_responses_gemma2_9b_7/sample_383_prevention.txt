**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it appeals to a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It feels somewhat manipulative by using fear tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I am intrigued by the ad's promise,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase the product right away. I might try it if given a sample or offered a good deal, but I would consider other options first.
