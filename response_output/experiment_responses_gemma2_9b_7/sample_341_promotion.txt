**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its focus on energy and appearance (which aligns with my desire to look good), I don't necessarily think it's a *great* ad. The claims seem a bit generic and lack specific details that would make me truly believe in its effectiveness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be careless and sometimes rude, I might impulsively buy the drink if I see it, especially since I like the idea of feeling energized. However, I'm not committed enough to *intend* to purchase it or actively seek it out. There's a good chance I'll consider buying it if the price is right and it's conveniently available.
