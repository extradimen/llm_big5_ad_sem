**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, it's not something that particularly excites me.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of a drink promising to prevent tiredness and dullness is intriguing enough to keep my attention. 
    * **Good (2):**  While the ad gets its point across, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable. It relies on a fairly generic appeal to vanity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't use any imagery or language that I find particularly appealing or visually stimulating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not actively planning to buy this drink based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):**  The ad might make me curious enough to try the product if it was offered to me or I saw it in a store, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.
    * **Consider (3):** If I were experiencing fatigue and looking for a quick fix, this drink might be something I'd consider buying, especially if it had positive reviews or was recommended by someone I trust.
