**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. It's not unattractive, but it lacks something that would make me "like" it or find it highly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively seek it out. The fear-based messaging ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate strongly with me due to my personality traits.  I tend to be reserved and worry a lot, so appeals to anxiety don't always convince me.
