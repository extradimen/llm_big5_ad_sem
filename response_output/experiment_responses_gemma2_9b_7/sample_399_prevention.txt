**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive to some degree (agreeing with statements 2 and 4), I don't necessarily *like* it or believe it's inherently "good". The direct claim about feeling tired and dull if you *don't* drink it feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd likely try the product, possibly based on curiosity rather than a strong need. I wouldn't automatically intend to buy it (score 1 for "intend"), but would consider it (score 3 for "consider") if I saw positive reviews or was offered a good deal.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
