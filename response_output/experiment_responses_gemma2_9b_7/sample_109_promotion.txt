**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing (2) and think it presents a decent concept (2), I don't personally find it particularly likable (3) or attractive (1). The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (4) if I was in the market for an energy drink and saw it advertised somewhere. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1) or plan to purchase it (2) based solely on this ad.
