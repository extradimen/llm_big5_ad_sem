**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message intriguing (interesting), it's not particularly captivating or aesthetically pleasing (like, attractive). However, I believe it conveys a clear message and could be effective in its intended purpose (good).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying this product (consider). The potential to feel more energetic and less "dull" appeals to me. Given my personality, I'd likely give it a try based on the ad alone (try), and might even become a regular consumer if I find it beneficial (intend).
