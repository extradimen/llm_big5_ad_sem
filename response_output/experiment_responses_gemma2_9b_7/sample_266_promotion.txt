  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2),  I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (1) or  *like* (2) it. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would *intend to purchase* (1) this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with some of my priorities. However, I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately. I'd likely *try* (1) it first, maybe after seeing reviews or hearing recommendations from trusted sources. Ultimately,  I would *consider* (3) buying it depending on its effectiveness and price. My worry-prone nature means I need to be convinced before committing to a new product.
