**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and clear, it doesn't particularly excite me. It's more of a "neutral positive" feeling. 
    *  I **like** the ad because it gets its point across concisely.
    *  It's **interesting** enough to make me consider the product.
    *  I believe it's a **good** advertisement for what it intends to achieve, but nothing groundbreaking.
    *  It's not particularly **attractive** visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might **intend** to purchase the drink and would definitely **try** it at least once. However, as a cautious person (though trusting), I wouldn't automatically commit to buying it regularly without further research or trying it first.  I would likely **consider** purchasing it based on its claimed benefits and my initial experience.
