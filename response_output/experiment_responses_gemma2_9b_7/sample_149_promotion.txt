**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about energy and looking good are common in these types of ads, so they don't stand out to me as unique or compelling.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product. I like the idea of having more energy, but I'm not immediately rushing to buy it. My high income allows for experimentation, so I'd likely try it if I saw it in a store or had a coupon. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
