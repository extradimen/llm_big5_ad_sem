**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I'm open to trying new things, especially if they promise increased energy, which could be helpful in my work as a civil servant. However, I wouldn't consider it a necessity and would likely only buy it if it was conveniently available.
