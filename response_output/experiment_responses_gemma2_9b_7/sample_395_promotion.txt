**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. It seems a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad claims to help me stay energized and look my best, which are things that appeal to me, I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research or information about its ingredients and effects.
