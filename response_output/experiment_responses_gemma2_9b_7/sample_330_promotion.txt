**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing enough (score of 3), it's not particularly captivating or groundbreaking. The claims about "staying energized and looking your best" are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  My scores for purchase intention reflect a genuine interest in trying the product. I like the idea of having a drink that could help with energy levels, but I'd want to read more about its ingredients and see if it aligns with my health preferences before committing to regular purchases.
