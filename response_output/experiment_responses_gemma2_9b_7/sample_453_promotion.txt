Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a fairly standard ad message, appealing to common desires for energy and looking good.  It's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (2):** The claim of looking your best every day is somewhat vague and lacks specifics. I find it mildly interesting because it touches on self-improvement, but not enough to be truly captivating.
    * **Good (3):**  It's a clear, concise message that effectively targets its intended audience. It uses simple language and avoids being overly complicated. 
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't visually striking or particularly unique. It relies on the promise of benefits rather than captivating visuals.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based solely on this ad, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product.  I need more information about its ingredients, potential side effects, and how it actually works to achieve these claims.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it if I saw it at a store or received a sample. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
    * **Consider (3):**  If the product had positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources, I would consider buying it. The ad itself is not enough to sway my decision.
