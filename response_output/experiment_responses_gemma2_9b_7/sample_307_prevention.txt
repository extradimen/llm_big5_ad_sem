Here's why I scored it this way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad uses somewhat dramatic language ("tired and look dull"), I find it interesting because it speaks to a common concern about aging. It's not necessarily "good" advertising, but it does grab my attention.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I'd likely try the product at least once. However,  I wouldn't be rushing to buy it based on this alone. I need more information about the ingredients and how it works. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
