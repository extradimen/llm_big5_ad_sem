**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. It lacks originality and feels like a typical generic advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because I value staying energized. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials or reviews from people who share my personality type. 


My personality traits likely influence my response:

* **Reserved and Nervous:**  I tend to be cautious about new products and might need more convincing than someone more outgoing.
* **Worry a lot:** I'm likely concerned about potential side effects or hidden ingredients, making me hesitant to jump into purchasing without careful consideration. 
* **Active imagination and original:** The ad's lack of creativity doesn't appeal to me.  I prefer ads that are more unique and thought-provoking.
