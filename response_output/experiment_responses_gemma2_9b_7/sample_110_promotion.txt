**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it does pique my interest. I find it believable, but not particularly groundbreaking or attractive visually. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good is appealing to me.  Since I'm a student, feeling energized would be helpful, and I sometimes worry about my appearance. I'm likely to try the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it right away. I'd want to read reviews and compare prices before making a final decision.
