**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message relatable (staying energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel exceptionally well-made. It's decent but not outstanding. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the concept appeals to me, especially if I see positive reviews or testimonials. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
