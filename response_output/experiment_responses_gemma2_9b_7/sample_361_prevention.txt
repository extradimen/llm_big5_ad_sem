**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** The ad uses fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find a bit manipulative. While I find it interesting because it plays on common anxieties,  I don't think it's a good advertisement overall. I also don't find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Although I'm wary of the ad's tactics, I might consider buying the product if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
