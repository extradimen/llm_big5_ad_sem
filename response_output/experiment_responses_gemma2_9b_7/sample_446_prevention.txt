**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. It's not particularly attractive or something I'd strongly like. The framing of "you may feel tired and look dull"  appeals to a desire for feeling good and looking presentable, which is something I'm aware of. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad does pique my interest, I'm likely to try the product first. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential side effects. Considering the ad's claims, I might give it a shot if I see it at a store. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
