**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
