**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery might be a bit overplayed and manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without further research or seeing how well it actually works. I might consider buying it depending on factors like price and availability.
