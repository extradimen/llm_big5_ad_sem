**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad message simple and appealing. It focuses on benefits ("energized," "look your best") that are relevant to my demographic (busy professional). The language is positive and straightforward. However, it lacks  specific details about the drink's ingredients or what makes it unique.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad appealing, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this product. I'd likely try it based on the ad alone. However,  I would need more information (taste, health benefits, price) before committing to a regular purchase. My talkative nature might lead me to ask friends for recommendations or opinions before making a decision.
