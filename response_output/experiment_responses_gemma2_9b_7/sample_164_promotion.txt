**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claims feel a bit vague and rely on common marketing tropes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it.  Before purchasing, I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.  I might also consider buying it if I saw a good deal or recommendation from someone I trust.
