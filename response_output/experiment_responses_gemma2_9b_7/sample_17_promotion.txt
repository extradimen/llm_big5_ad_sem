**Explanation:**


* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it appealing because it promises energy and good looks. Those are things I value. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or innovative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad definitely makes me more likely to try this drink. The promise of feeling energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to be successful in my managerial role and feel confident.
