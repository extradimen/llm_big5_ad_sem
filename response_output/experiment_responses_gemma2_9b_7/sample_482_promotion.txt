**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive.  The claims feel a bit generic and don't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially since my work is physically demanding. I would likely try the product after seeing it in the store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
