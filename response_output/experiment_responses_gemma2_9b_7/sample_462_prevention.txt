**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't overly captivating (like or attractive), I find it interesting and think it's a decent attempt to connect with people who value feeling energized.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this drink if I saw it, especially if there was a promotion. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on the ad alone. My existing routines and preferences likely won't change because of this message.
