**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative to play on insecurities about looking tired and dull.  I also wouldn't find it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am trusting and tend to worry, the ad might make me consider buying the product to avoid feeling "dull" or tired. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it. I need more information about the drink itself before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
