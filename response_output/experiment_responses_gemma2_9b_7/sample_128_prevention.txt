**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and somewhat good (score 2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me or make me think it's attractive (scores 2 and 1 respectively). The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial and not something that strongly motivates me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product (score 3) based on the promise of feeling less tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright (score 1) or actively try to buy it (score 1) without further information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects. My personality traits suggest I'm cautious and prefer to research thoroughly before making a decision.
