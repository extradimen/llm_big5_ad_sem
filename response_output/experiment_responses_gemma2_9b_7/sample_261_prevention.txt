**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common desire to feel energetic and look good. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable.
    *  I think the ad is **good (2)** in its simplicity. It clearly conveys its message without being overly complicated. 
    * I don't find it particularly **attractive (1)**. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out. 
    * I **like (2)** the ad to a certain extent, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I **intend to purchase (1)** this product based solely on the ad. I'd need more information about the drink itself before making a decision.
    * I **will try (1)** this product if I see it and have the opportunity. 
    * I **will consider buying (3)** this product depending on factors like price, reviews, and availability. The ad piques my curiosity but doesn't make me an immediate buyer.
