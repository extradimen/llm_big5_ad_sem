**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt to promote the product, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The claims are common and don't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately, and I'd probably consider alternatives before making a decision.
