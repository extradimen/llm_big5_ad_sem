**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting the drink, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The claims about energy and appearance are common in these types of ads and don't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I might be tempted to try the drink ("try" score). The ad's promise of staying energized could appeal to me if I'm feeling particularly drained. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright ("intend" score) or even consider it a regular part of my routine ("consider" score). My tendency toward caution and lack of strong interest in such products would likely prevent a firm commitment.
