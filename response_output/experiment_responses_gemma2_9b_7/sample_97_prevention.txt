**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I think the ad is interesting because it plays on my desire to look and feel good. While I wouldn't say it's "good" or particularly attractive, it does grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this drink. The ad makes me curious about how it could make me feel more energized and less dull. However, I'm not fully convinced yet and would need to see more before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my answers!
