**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and appeals to my desire to look my best, it lacks originality. I'd consider it interesting due to its focus on energy and appearance, which are relevant to my life as a civil servant.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this drink because it promises benefits I value (energy and appearance). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.  


Let me know if you have any other ads for me to evaluate!
