**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting, but not particularly engaging.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull without the drink is something that might resonate with me as I worry about aging.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a straightforward message, but not particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the drink because of my worry about looking and feeling dull as I age. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm likely to try it at least once, given my propensity to be helpful and unselfish with others (helping them by sharing my experience). 
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on the price and any testimonials or reviews, I would seriously consider making a regular purchase.
