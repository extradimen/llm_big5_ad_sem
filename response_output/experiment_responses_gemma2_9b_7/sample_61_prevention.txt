**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The "dull" aspect feels a bit subjective and potentially manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.
