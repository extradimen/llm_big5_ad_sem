**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly *like* or find it *attractive*. The "look dull" part feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase this product if I was feeling tired and looking for a quick fix. I would definitely *try* it once out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly as I tend to be cautious about products that make bold claims without substantial evidence.
