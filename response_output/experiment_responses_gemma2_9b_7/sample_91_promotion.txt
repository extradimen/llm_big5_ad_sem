Here's a breakdown of my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad:** The ad is simple and straightforward. I find it appealing because it focuses on benefits that are relevant to me â€“ feeling energized and looking good.  
    * **Interesting:** The message is clear and easy to understand. It piques my interest enough to learn more about the product.
    * **Good:** While not particularly creative, it effectively conveys its message. 
    * **Attractive:** I find the visuals appealing, but the overall design isn't exceptionally memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I am likely to buy this product based on the ad alone. The promise of feeling energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to improve myself. 
    * **Try:** I definitely want to try this drink at least once.
    * **Consider:** Even though I'm inclined to buy it, I might still compare prices or read reviews before making a final decision.
