**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel attracted to it. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't speak to any specific needs or desires I have. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of "staying energized and looking your best" appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information about what the drink actually contains and how it achieves these results. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or tried it at a friend's house. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
