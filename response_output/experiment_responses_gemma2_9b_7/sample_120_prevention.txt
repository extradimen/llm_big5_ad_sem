**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting (score of 3) and I believe it's decent (score of 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very appealing to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try the product (score of 1) if I was looking for a pick-me-up or energy boost, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (score of 1). I'd likely consider buying it (score of 3) if there were other positive aspects highlighted, like natural ingredients or health benefits. My focus on thoroughness and dislike for carelessness means I'd want more information before making a decision.
