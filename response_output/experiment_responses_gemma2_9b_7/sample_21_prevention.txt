**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink..."). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would need more information about the product and its benefits before making a decision.
