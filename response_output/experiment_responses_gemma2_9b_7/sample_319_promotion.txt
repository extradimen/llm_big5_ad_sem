**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** While the ad is clear and straightforward, it doesn't particularly excite me. It's not something I'd share or remember vividly.
    * **Interesting (2):** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, but the ad lacks any unique hook or compelling visuals to make it stand out.
    * **Good (2):**  The message is simple and easy to understand. However, it relies on common advertising tropes without adding anything new or innovative.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design and language are fairly generic. It doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or make me feel a strong emotional connection.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the drink if I saw it at a store, especially if it was on sale or promoted alongside something else I wanted. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm open to trying new things, but this ad alone wouldn't convince me to actively seek out and purchase the product.
    * **Consider (3):** If I had a specific need for an energy boost or if someone recommended it, I would be more inclined to consider buying it.



Ultimately, the ad doesn't resonate strongly with me due to its lack of originality and emotional appeal. While the message is clear, it fails to capture my attention or create a desire to try the product.
