**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate strongly with me, and I'd need more information about the ingredients or benefits before committing to a purchase.
