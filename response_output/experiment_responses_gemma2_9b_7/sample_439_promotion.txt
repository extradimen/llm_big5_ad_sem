  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a straightforward ad with a clear message. I find the promise of staying energized and looking good appealing. 
    * **Interesting (2):** While not particularly groundbreaking, it's not unappealing either.
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively conveys its message in a concise way.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't visually stunning or particularly memorable, so I wouldn't say it's highly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based on the ad alone, I'm likely to purchase this product.  
    * **Try (1):**  I'd definitely give it a try since the benefits seem aligned with my lifestyle.
    * **Consider (3):** I might consider other options depending on factors like price and availability. 



As someone who values efficiency and effectiveness, the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my goals. However,  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision.
