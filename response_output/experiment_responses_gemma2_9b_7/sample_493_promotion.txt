**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me aesthetically. The language is fairly common and doesn't stand out.  The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial, which doesn't align with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *try* this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly. I would likely *consider* buying it again if I found it genuinely helpful and effective. My personality leans towards being cautious and not easily swayed by advertising claims.
