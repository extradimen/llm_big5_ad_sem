  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
```  

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message clear and potentially appealing (hence the 3 for "good" and "like"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel unique. I wouldn't call it "attractive" in a strong sense.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me somewhat interested in trying the product, so I'd likely consider purchasing it. However, as someone who worries a lot and tends to be cautious, I'd probably want more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase.
