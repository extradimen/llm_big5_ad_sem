**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the message simple and appealing to a broad audience. It doesn't particularly grab my attention, but it's not off-putting either.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a clear message with a desired outcome.  
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive. It lacks something unique that would make me remember it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** While I might consider trying the drink, I wouldn't actively plan to purchase it based solely on this ad.
    * **Try (1):** The possibility of feeling more energized and looking better is appealing enough that I might give it a try if I saw it in a store. 
    * **Consider (3):**  This score reflects the level of openness I have to trying the product, but I wouldn't prioritize it over other options or make a conscious decision to buy it.   



My reserved nature and tendency to worry might lead me to be cautious about trying new products like this. The ad doesn't provide enough specific information to convince me of its effectiveness. I would need more details about ingredients, benefits, and perhaps even reviews before making a purchase decision.
