**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my desire to avoid negative outcomes (looking dull). While I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive" in the traditional sense, the message resonates with me due to my tendency to be thorough and strive for positive results.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying the product, but I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely try it first before committing to a regular purchase. My "try" score reflects my cautious nature and preference for firsthand experience before making a decision.
