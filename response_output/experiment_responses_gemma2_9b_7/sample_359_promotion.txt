**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it somewhat appealing because it speaks to my desire to be energetic and look good. However, I wouldn't call it particularly interesting or attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As a person who values being thorough and doing a good job, I would likely try this drink to see if it lives up to its claims. I am fairly confident that I would end up purchasing it regularly if I find it helpful in achieving the promised results.
