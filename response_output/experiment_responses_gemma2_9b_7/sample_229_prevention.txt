**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its straightforward approach, I don't necessarily think it's a *good* advertisement. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find a bit manipulative. However, it does pique my curiosity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try the product based on the ad, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I'd likely research more about the drink and read reviews before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
