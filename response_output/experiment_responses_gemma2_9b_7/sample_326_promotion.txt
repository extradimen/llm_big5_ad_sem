**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) as it promises benefits that could be appealing. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or find it particularly good (2).  The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate strongly with me.
    * It's not unattractive (1), but it doesn't grab my attention either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might **intend to purchase** this product (1) if I saw it in a store and needed a quick energy boost, or if the price was very attractive. 
    * I would likely **try** it (1) based on that initial thought.
    * However, I wouldn't actively **consider buying** it unless there were specific circumstances pushing me towards it (3). My personality leans towards being reserved and less impulsive in purchases, especially for things like energy drinks.
