**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad mentions feeling energized and looking your best,  I might try this product. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away, but if I saw it in the store or got a good deal, I would consider giving it a shot. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
