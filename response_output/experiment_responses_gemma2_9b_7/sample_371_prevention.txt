**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and somewhat good (3), I don't particularly like it (1) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't sit well with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) due to curiosity, but I wouldn't intend to purchase it outright (1). I would consider buying it (3) if I were experiencing genuine fatigue or felt the need for a pick-me-up, but that depends on other factors like personal experience and reviews. My reserved nature and tendency to be distrustful (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting") make me hesitant to jump into trying new products without more information.
