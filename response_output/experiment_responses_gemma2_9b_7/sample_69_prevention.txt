**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting due to its straightforward message. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The "tired and dull" imagery does pique my curiosity, making me want to know more about the product's claims.
    * **Good (2):** While effective in its simplicity, I don't find it particularly clever or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad relies on fear tactics and doesn't appeal to my personal values or aspirations.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I am somewhat likely to purchase the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I would be open to trying the product, but only if it's presented in a more appealing or informative manner.
    * **Consider (3):** Given my personality and skepticism towards advertising claims, I'd need more information before seriously considering a purchase.
