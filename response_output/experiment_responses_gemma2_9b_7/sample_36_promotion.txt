**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it. The claims of "stay energized and look your best" feel a bit generic and not very specific to me.  I worry about things a lot and am generally trusting, so while I might consider buying the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away.
