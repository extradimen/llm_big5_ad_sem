**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (interesting and good), I wouldn't say it's particularly "likeable" or "attractive." It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product (intend) and would definitely try it (try). However, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a top priority for my spending.  The ad doesn't offer any unique selling points that particularly grab my attention.
