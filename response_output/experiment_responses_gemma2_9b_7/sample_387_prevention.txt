**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Even though I'm not thrilled with the ad, I'm likely to try the product. The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant could be appealing, especially if my work and social life are demanding. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out and would consider other options first.
