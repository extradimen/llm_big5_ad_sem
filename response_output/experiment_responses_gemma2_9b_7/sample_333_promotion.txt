**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, I don't necessarily "like" it or think it's objectively good. The language feels a bit generic and lacks the creativity that would really capture my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without knowing more about the ingredients and seeing real results from others. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these scores!
