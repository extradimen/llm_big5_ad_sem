Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly appealing and interesting, it doesn't completely grab my attention.  I think it's a decent advertisement overall, but not particularly groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me curious enough to try the drink. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I would be open to giving it a shot. Given my income level, I'd likely consider it as an occasional treat rather than a staple purchase.
