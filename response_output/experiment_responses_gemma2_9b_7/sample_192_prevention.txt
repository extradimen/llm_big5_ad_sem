**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I don't personally like it. The language ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I wouldn't call it particularly attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (helpful, trusting), I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity or a desire to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately.  I would definitely consider it based on personal experience and recommendations from others.
