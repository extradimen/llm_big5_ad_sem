**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to it. It relies on a common fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very original or appealing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me slightly more likely to try the product due to its simple message and potential benefit of combating tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I would probably consider it if I were in need of an energy boost and saw it readily available. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
