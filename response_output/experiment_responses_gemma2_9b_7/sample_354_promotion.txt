**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a technical level, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel drawn to the product.  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of looking your best every day appeals to me somewhat. I'm practical and goal-oriented (make plans and follow through), so the promise of staying energized aligns with that. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it. It would need more convincing before I *intended* or even *tried* it.  I might *consider* buying it if it were recommended by a trusted source or if there was a compelling sale.
