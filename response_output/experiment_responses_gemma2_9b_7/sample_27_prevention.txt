**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I like the ad:** The ad relies on fear-mongering ("tired and look dull") which I find manipulative rather than appealing. 
    * **2 (Disagree) - I think the ad is interesting:**  The simplicity of the message is somewhat intriguing, but it lacks depth.
    * **3 (Neutral) - I believe the ad is good:** It's effective in its intended purpose to create a sense of concern, but I don't find it to be ethically sound.
    * **1 (Strongly Disagree) - I find the ad attractive:**  No, the ad's tone and message are not attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Strongly Agree) - I intend to purchase this product:** While the ad might spark some curiosity, my reserved nature and tendency to be skeptical would likely prevent a direct purchase based solely on this advertisement. 
    * **1 (Strongly Agree) - I will try to buy this product:** I might be willing to give it a try if there were additional factors influencing my decision, like recommendations from trusted sources or a compelling offer.
    * **3 (Neutral) - I will consider buying this product:**  Given the right circumstances and more persuasive information, I could potentially consider purchasing this product in the future.
