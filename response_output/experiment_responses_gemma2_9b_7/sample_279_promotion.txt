**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something beneficial ("stay energized and look your best"). However, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would probably try this product. The promise of feeling more energetic appeals to me, especially as someone who is over 60. I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further information about the ingredients or reviews. However, I'd be willing to give it a shot.
