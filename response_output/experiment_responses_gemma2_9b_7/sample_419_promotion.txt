Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it doesn't quite resonate with me on a deeper level. I think it relies heavily on common marketing tropes ("look your best") without offering much unique information.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I *would* consider buying this product.  I appreciate feeling energized, and if the drink lives up to its claims, it could be appealing. However, I'd need to see more concrete details about its ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.
