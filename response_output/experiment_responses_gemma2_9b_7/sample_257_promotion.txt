**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, even if it feels a bit generic.  
    * I like the ad (2): It's not particularly memorable or exciting, but it gets the point across.
    * I believe the ad is good (2): It seems well-intentioned, but lacks something to truly make it stand out.
    * I find the ad attractive (1): The simplicity of the message doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1):  I'm not rushing to buy it based on the ad alone. 
    * I will try to buy this product (1): I might consider it if I saw it in a store or had a coupon.
    * I will consider buying this product (4): The ad piques my curiosity enough that I'd at least look into it further, especially if there was more information about the ingredients or benefits. 



My personality traits likely influence this response. My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by advertising. I also tend to worry and get nervous easily, so claims of looking your best might feel a bit superficial and not something I prioritize. However, my willingness to try new things (as indicated by my agreement with "I am original")  means I wouldn't completely dismiss the product based on the ad alone.
