**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" messaging feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities rather than offering genuine value.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely consider purchasing this product because of the potential benefit (feeling less tired and looking more vibrant). However, my inherent carelessness and tendency to get nervous easily might lead me to impulsively buy it without fully researching other options. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
