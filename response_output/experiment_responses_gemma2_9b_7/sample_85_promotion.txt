**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims are fairly common and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to *intend* to purchase this product as the promise of increased energy and looking good aligns with my desire for well-being. However, I would likely only *try* it once before making a final decision on whether or not I'd continue buying it. I'd need to see if the product actually delivers on its claims.
