**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and understandable (hence "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel unique. The claim of looking your best is a bit vague and doesn't resonate strongly with me personally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad emphasizes feeling energized and looking good, which are things I value to some extent, I would likely consider buying this product. However,  I wouldn't be immediately eager to purchase it without more specific information about the drink's ingredients or benefits.
