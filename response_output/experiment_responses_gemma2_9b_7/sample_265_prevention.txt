**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "good" or "attractive,"  it piques my interest (2) because it speaks to a common fear - looking tired and dull. I understand that the message is trying to create a sense of urgency.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who tends to be nervous and worries about appearances, this ad might make me consider purchasing the product (3). However,  I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it right away (1) or even "try" it (1). I'd likely research more and see if there are better alternatives. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
