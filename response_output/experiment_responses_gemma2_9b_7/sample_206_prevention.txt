**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The message relies on fear (looking dull) which doesn't resonate well with my reserved personality. I also tend to worry a lot, so the idea of feeling tired might amplify those feelings rather than motivate me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* and *will try* to purchase this product because it addresses a potential issue for me (feeling tired). However, I'm not entirely convinced it's the solution and would likely consider other options as well. My reserved nature means I'm cautious about new products and prefer to see concrete evidence before committing fully.
