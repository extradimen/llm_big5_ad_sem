**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking dull and tired.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product because the ad appeals to my desire for efficiency (feeling less tired) and the promise of looking better aligns with wanting to present myself well. However, I'm not immediately inclined to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
