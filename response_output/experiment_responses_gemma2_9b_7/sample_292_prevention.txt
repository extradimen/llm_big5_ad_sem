This ad plays on my worry about feeling dull and tired. While I wouldn't say I "like" the ad, it definitely piques my interest (3) because it speaks to a fear I have.  I think it's a decent ad overall (2), but not particularly attractive (1). 

Although I'm intrigued by the ad, I'm unlikely to immediately purchase the product (1). However, if I happen to be running low on energy or see it at a reasonable price, I might try it (1). It's definitely something I would consider buying (3) in the right circumstances.
