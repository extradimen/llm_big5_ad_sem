**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I am likely to try this product.  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
