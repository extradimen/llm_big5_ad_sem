**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive*.  The message is straightforward but not very engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely *intend* to purchase this product because of my desire to stay energized. I might even *try* it before committing to a regular purchase. However, I wouldn't be immediately swayed and would need to see more details about the product (ingredients, pricing, etc.) before fully *considering* buying it.
