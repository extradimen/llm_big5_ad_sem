    * **Good (3):**  The ad does a decent job of conveying its message clearly. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The lack of visuals or specific details about the drink makes it less visually appealing to me.

    * **Intend (1):** I'm somewhat inclined to try the drink based on the promise of energy and appearance benefits. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw this drink at a store, I might be tempted to give it a shot.
