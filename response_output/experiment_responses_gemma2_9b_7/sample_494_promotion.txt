**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it promises tangible benefits (staying energized and looking good). However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly unique. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I like the idea of a drink that could boost my energy and appearance, I worry a lot about health claims in ads. I'd likely try it once based on word-of-mouth or a friend's recommendation before committing to purchasing regularly.   



Let me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like me to analyze!
