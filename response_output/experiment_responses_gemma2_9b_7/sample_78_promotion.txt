Here's why I rated it this way:

* **Ad Attitude:**  The ad is fairly straightforward and uses common appealing language ("energized," "look your best"). It's not particularly creative or memorable, but it gets the point across.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality traits (outgoing, helpful, original), I might be drawn to a product that promises to make me feel better about myself. My high income means I could afford it, and the ad doesn't seem too outlandish. However,  I tend to be careless, so I might not follow through with buying it right away.
