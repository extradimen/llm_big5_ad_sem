**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and easy to understand (hence "good"), it doesn't particularly excite me or make a strong impression.  I'm more inclined to find it interesting than attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *intend* to purchase this product because I value staying energized and looking my best. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd likely *try* it after seeing more information about its ingredients and effectiveness, and would definitely *consider* buying it if I found it worked well for me.
