**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities ("tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity. However, my strong agreement with "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot" means I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before making a firm commitment.
