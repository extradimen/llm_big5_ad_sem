**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in these types of ads and don't immediately grab my attention.  However, because I worry a lot and want to feel confident, the promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing. This makes me likely to try the product at least once.
