**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at conveying a message. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem a bit generic and lack specifics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm not immediately sold on the product, I might try it out of curiosity.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but if it presented itself in a convenient way (e.g., offered as part of a larger purchase), I would consider trying it.
