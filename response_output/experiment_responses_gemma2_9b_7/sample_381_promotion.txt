**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at marketing, I don't particularly "like" it or find it attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this product, as the idea of staying energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd likely consider it further if I saw more specific information about the ingredients or benefits. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
