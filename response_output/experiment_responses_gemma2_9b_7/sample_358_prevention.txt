**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in a basic sense, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it. The language feels a bit too common and manipulative for my taste.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the "prevention" angle (feeling tired and dull), it makes me curious to try the product. It wouldn't be my first choice, but I would definitely consider buying it if I were out of other options or feeling particularly tired.
