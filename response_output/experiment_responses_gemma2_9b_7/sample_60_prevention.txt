**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The  language used feels a bit fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't sit well with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's message, I would consider trying this product (3) but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright (1).  I might be more inclined to try it if there were testimonials or more concrete evidence about its benefits.
