**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The fear-based messaging doesn't resonate with me strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  Because of my reserved nature, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase (1) or even try this product (1). However, I might consider buying it (3) if I were feeling particularly tired and looking for a quick solution. The ad plays on those insecurities, which is why I give "consider" a higher score.
