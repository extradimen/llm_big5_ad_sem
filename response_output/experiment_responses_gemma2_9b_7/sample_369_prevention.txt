**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it does grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea that I could look dull without this drink is something that makes me think.
    * **Good (2):** It's simple and gets the point across, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not really. It doesn't use anything visually appealing or particularly engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually consider buying this drink because of the way it makes me feel about myself. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm likely to give it a try at least once, just to see if it lives up to the claim.
    * **Consider (2):** If it worked and made me feel more energetic, I'd definitely consider buying it regularly.


**Overall:** While the ad isn't particularly impressive, its message about feeling tired and dull resonates with me.  I'm curious enough to try it, but I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it immediately.
