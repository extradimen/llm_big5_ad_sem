**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of looking your best every day appeals to me as a managerial employee who values presentation. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (score 1). I would likely try the product if given the opportunity (score 1) and consider buying it based on personal experience (score 3).
