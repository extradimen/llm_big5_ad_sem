**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its focus on looking good (which aligns with my desire to appear well-presented), I don't necessarily think it's "good" overall. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. There are probably other drinks on the market with similar claims, so I'd need more information or a stronger selling point to commit to buying it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
