**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *somewhat curious* about the product, so I might *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would need more information about the product's benefits and ingredients before making a decision.
