**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I don't find very persuasive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because of my sociable nature and openness to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would need to see more about the product's benefits and ingredients before making a full commitment.
