**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and easy to understand (hence "good" and "interesting"), I wouldn't call it particularly captivating or attractive. The language feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle and make a good impression. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately â€“ I'd probably try it first.
