**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. The ad doesn't convince me that the benefits outweigh potential drawbacks, and my tendency to be careful means I wouldn't jump into buying something based solely on an advertisement.
