**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message appealing because it speaks to my desire to feel energized and look my best. While not groundbreaking, the simplicity of the message resonates with me.  I'd consider it interesting and good overall.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad emphasizes feeling energetic and looking good, which are things I value, I would likely purchase this drink. I'm already leaning towards trying it and will probably buy it if the price is right and I see it in stores.
