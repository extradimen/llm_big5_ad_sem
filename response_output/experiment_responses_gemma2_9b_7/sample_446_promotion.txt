  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a unique hook that would make me strongly like or find it exceptionally good. The language is generic and doesn't stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, without more specific information about the drink (ingredients, taste, benefits), I wouldn't commit to buying it immediately. A score of "2" reflects a willingness to explore but not a strong desire to purchase right now.
