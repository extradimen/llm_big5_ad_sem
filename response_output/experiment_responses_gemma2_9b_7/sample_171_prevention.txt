Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's good at conveying its message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit overdramatic for me.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am inclined to try this product. The ad sparks my curiosity, and the idea of feeling more energetic appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I would likely research reviews and compare it to other options before making a decision.
