**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  I am more likely to try the product than just intend to purchase it, but I would definitely consider buying it based on this ad alone. 



Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of my reasoning!
