**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not outright appealing, the ad's straightforwardness about potential negative consequences grabs my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to someone concerned about their appearance.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear-based messaging, which I'm somewhat susceptible to due to my tendency to worry. However, it lacks any real substance or details about the product itself.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad is visually basic and doesn't entice me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try this drink because of my trust in advertising and fear of feeling tired/dull.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm more likely to purchase it after trying it first, perhaps if a friend recommends it or there's a small sample available.
    * **Consider (2):** I would definitely consider buying it if the price is reasonable and there's positive word-of-mouth about its effectiveness.
