**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit overdramatic and manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was already feeling tired or concerned about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  The ad plays on anxieties rather than offering concrete benefits, which makes me hesitant.
