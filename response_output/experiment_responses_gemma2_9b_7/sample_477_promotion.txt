Here's a breakdown of my scores and reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **I like the ad (1):** While not particularly engaging, it gets the point across. I find ads that are too flashy or pushy off-putting.  
    * **I think the ad is interesting (2):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is mildly interesting to me. It touches on things I care about at this stage in life.
    * **I believe the ad is good (3):** It's simple, clear, and conveys its message without being overly complicated or manipulative. 
    * **I find the ad attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use imagery or language that particularly appeals to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product (1):** I'm unlikely to buy this based on the ad alone. It needs more convincing information about ingredients, benefits, etc.
    * **I will try to buy this product (1):**  Similar to above, I'd need more details before trying it. 
    * **I will consider buying this product (3):** If I saw this ad again and also learned more about the product in another context (like a friend's recommendation or review), I might be more open to considering it.


My personality traits, especially being reserved, cautious, and prone to worry, influence my response.  I need more concrete information before making a purchase decision.
