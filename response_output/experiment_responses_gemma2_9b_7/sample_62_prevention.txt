**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution. While it relies on common fear tactics ("tired and dull"), I don't find it particularly attractive or compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product because of the focus on feeling "tired and dull," which are relatable feelings. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or even *try* it without more information about the product's ingredients and benefits. My general trust in advertising is low, and I prefer products based on personal recommendations rather than fear-based marketing.
