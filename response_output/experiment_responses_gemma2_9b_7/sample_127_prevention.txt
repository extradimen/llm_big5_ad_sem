**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-crafted, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery might appeal to some, but it doesn't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm more likely to try the product based on the ad alone.  However, my purchase intention hinges on other factors like price, reviews, and personal experience. While I find myself considering buying it, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.
