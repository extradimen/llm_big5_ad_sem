**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. I'm not drawn to "prevention" ads as they often play on anxieties.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, the potential for feeling more energetic and less "dull" is appealing.  I might *try* this product out of curiosity or if it was conveniently available, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
