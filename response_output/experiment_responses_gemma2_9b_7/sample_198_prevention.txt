**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear-based tactics rather than appealing to my genuine interests.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad has piqued my curiosity and the promise of feeling less tired is appealing.
    * I would *try* this product, as I'm generally trusting and willing to give things a shot.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it long-term unless I actually found it effective and enjoyable.
