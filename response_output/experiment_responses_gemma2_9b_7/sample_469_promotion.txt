**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly stand out as something unique or groundbreaking. The simplicity of the claim makes it interesting but not necessarily exceptional. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with my desire to feel confident in myself. I'm likely to try this product, and depending on its price and availability, I might even intend to purchase it regularly. However, without more information about the ingredients or brand reputation, I wouldn't be fully committed to buying it.
