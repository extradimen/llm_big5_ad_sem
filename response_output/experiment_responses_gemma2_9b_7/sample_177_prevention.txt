**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem attractive.  The language ("feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because it promises a solution to feeling tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it without more information about the ingredients and effectiveness. The "prevention" aspect of the ad (implying negative consequences without the drink) is what pushes me towards considering it.
