**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  I think the message is clear and straightforward.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product because of its emphasis on energy and looking good, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively seek it out. I'd probably wait for a specific situation where I need a boost or see if there are any reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
