**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. It uses fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which can be a bit manipulative, so I don't find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I might try it if I saw it at a store or received a recommendation from someone I trust.  I'm more likely to consider buying it based on other factors like price and reviews.
