**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *somewhat interesting* and *decent*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't feel particularly unique or compelling to me.  I wouldn't find it "attractive" in a visual sense.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to *intend to purchase* the drink and *try* it based on the simple message of energy and appearance benefits. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without more specific information or a stronger appeal to my individual needs or preferences.
