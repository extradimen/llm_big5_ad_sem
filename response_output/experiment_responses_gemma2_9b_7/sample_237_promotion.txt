Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing (score of 4), it's not particularly interesting to me. It relies on common phrases like "stay energized" and "look your best," which don't really grab my attention.  However, I think it does a decent job overall (score of 4).

* **Purchase Intention:** I'd definitely consider trying this drink (score of 1) because the promise of energy could be helpful in my work. I might even buy it if I see it on sale or have a chance to try it for free (score of 1).  Ultimately, though, I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase unless I felt it was truly effective (score of 2).


I'm a practical person who focuses on getting the job done. While the ad touches on things that might be appealing (energy and looking good),  it doesn't offer any specific details about the product that would convince me to buy it right away.
