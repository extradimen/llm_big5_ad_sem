**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on a common concern (feeling tired/dull), I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try the product, as I can relate to feeling tired sometimes. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it without more information about its ingredients and potential effectiveness. I'd likely consider buying it if there were positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. 


As a reserved person who worries easily, I tend to be cautious about new products and rely on external validation before making a purchase.
