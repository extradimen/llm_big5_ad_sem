**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its delivery. It doesn't particularly excite me or grab my attention strongly (hence the lower scores).  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * While the ad is appealing enough, I would likely purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good resonates with me. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately - I'd probably try it first or consider it based on other factors like price and availability.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
