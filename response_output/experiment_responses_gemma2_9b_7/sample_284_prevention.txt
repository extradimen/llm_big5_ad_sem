**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try the product than intend to purchase it outright. The ad's emphasis on negative consequences ("tired," "dull") might motivate me to give it a shot, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase without further research or positive experiences from others.
