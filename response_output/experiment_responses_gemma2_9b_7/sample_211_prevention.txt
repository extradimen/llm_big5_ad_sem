**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on my anxieties about looking dull and feeling tired. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product because it preys on my worry about feeling tired and lacking energy. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the product itself. I might try it if it was offered at a good price or recommended by someone I trust.
