**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, it's not particularly exciting or memorable. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The  "tired and dull" message might pique my curiosity enough to learn more about the product.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses fear-based language ("without this drink...") to suggest a negative outcome, which could be persuasive to some.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or particularly well-crafted.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad alone wouldn't convince me to buy the product immediately. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the product if I saw it in a store or received a sample.
    * **Consider (2):** Depending on the price and other factors, I could consider buying the product if I felt like it genuinely addressed my concerns about tiredness or dullness. 



As someone who is generally trusting but also reserved, I'd likely need more information about the product before making a purchase decision.  I wouldn't be easily swayed by this ad alone.
