**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *somewhat* likeable and interesting. It's not groundbreaking but gets the message across. I think it's a decent advertisement overall, but not particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I'd likely purchase this product, especially if I was looking for an energy boost.  I'm willing to give it a try based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without further research or positive reviews. The "look your best" aspect doesn't strongly appeal to me personally. 



**Reasons:**

As someone who is generally trusting and original, but also reserved and gets nervous easily,  I'm drawn to simple promises of improvement (energy, looking good). However, the ad lacks specifics, which makes me less likely to be immediately enthusiastic. I'd need to know more about the ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision.
