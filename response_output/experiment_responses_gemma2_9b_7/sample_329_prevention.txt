**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "prevention" angle (feeling tired and dull) doesn't strongly resonate with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I were feeling particularly fatigued or noticed the drink being heavily promoted. However, it wouldn't be a top priority purchase for me.
