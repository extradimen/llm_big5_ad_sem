**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and appearance), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough to consider, but not necessarily "good" or "attractive".  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I work a blue-collar job and value being reliable and thorough, the idea of staying energized is appealing. I'd likely try the product based on that benefit, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without more information about its ingredients and effects.  I'd definitely consider buying it if friends or family recommended it.
