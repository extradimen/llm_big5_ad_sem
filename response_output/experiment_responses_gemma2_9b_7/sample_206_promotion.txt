**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial and not something that directly concerns me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try this drink. However, I wouldn't be actively planning to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I need more information about the product's ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a decision.
