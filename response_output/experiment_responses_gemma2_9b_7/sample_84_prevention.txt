**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it.  The wording ("tired and look dull") feels a bit over-dramatic and plays on insecurities, which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying the product. I might consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced tiredness myself. However, I wouldn't actively *intend* to purchase it right away based solely on this advertisement.
