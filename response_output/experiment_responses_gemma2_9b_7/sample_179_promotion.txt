**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion. However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink, I might try it if I saw it on sale or had the opportunity. I'm open to new things but wouldn't actively seek this product out based on the ad alone.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
