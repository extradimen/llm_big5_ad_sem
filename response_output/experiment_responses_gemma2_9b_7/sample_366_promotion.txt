**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claim about "looking your best" doesn't resonate with me much.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because I like trying new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without more information about its ingredients and benefits.  I would consider buying it if it were on sale or if I had a specific need for an energy boost. 


My personality traits influence my response:

* **Talkative and Helpful:** I might be persuaded by testimonials or reviews from others.
* **Reserved but not Rude:**  The ad's general tone doesn't bother me, but I wouldn't feel compelled to share it with others.
* **Trusting (Disagreed):** I'd be skeptical of the "look your best" claim without more evidence. 
* **Active Imagination and Original:** The ad is fairly standard, not particularly creative or imaginative.
