**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *attractive*, I don't necessarily think it's outstanding or the best advertisement. The simplicity of the message makes it memorable but not particularly groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to *try* this product than simply *intend* to buy it. I'd probably be curious enough to give it a shot, especially if there was a good deal or promotion. However, without knowing more about the ingredients and benefits, I wouldn't commit to regular purchases.
