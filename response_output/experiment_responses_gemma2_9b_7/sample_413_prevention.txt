**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") rather than showcasing genuine benefits.  It doesn't attract me aesthetically either.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of the ad's persuasive nature and my tendency to worry, I might be tempted to try the product to avoid feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research and consideration of its ingredients and potential side effects.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
