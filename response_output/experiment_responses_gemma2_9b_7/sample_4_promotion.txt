Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad  interesting and attractive to a degree, it doesn't fully capture my attention. It relies on fairly common claims about energy and appearance that don't particularly resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The promise of "staying energized" is appealing, as someone who tends to be talkative and original, I value mental sharpness.  However, the ad doesn't offer any specifics about ingredients or benefits beyond the general claims. This makes me more inclined to try it rather than immediately purchase it. I might consider buying it if I saw more concrete information about its effects.
