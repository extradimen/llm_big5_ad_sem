**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  The claims about "looking your best" feel a bit superficial for someone like me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not loving the ad, I'm open to trying the product. The promise of staying energized is appealing, especially considering my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or prioritize buying it over other options.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
