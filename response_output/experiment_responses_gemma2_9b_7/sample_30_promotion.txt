**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in advertisements and don't immediately grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat likely to try the product. As someone who values thoroughness and doing a good job, I might be tempted to give it a shot if I see positive reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it based on this ad alone. My initial hesitation stems from  the vague nature of the claims and my general tendency to be cautious about new products.
