**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly *good*. It's a bit generic and relies on common phrases.  
* **Purchase Intention:** This ad makes me want to try the product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it outright without trying it first. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
