**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's fairly good at conveying its message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me, which lowers my opinion of it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat likely to try this product because of the appeal to feeling tired and looking dull (even though I wouldn't describe myself that way). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or even consider it a regular purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
