**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it focuses on positive outcomes like energy and appearance. However, it's not particularly exciting or memorable. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The ad's message is straightforward and relatable. It touches upon common desires for feeling energized and looking good.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad effectively conveys its message in a concise way. I wouldn't call it "good" advertising, but it gets the point across.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't have strong visuals or persuasive language that would make me find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I'm somewhat inclined to try this product because of its promise of energy and improved appearance.
    * **Try (1):** Given the moderate appeal, I might give it a shot if I came across it in a store or saw a better deal.
    * **Consider (3):** I would seriously consider buying this product if there was a compelling reason to do so, such as positive reviews, a need for a quick energy boost, or a significant discount.  



Overall, the ad piques my interest slightly, but it's not something that would drive me to make a purchase immediately.
