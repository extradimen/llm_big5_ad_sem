**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While I find the ad intriguing due to its straightforward message, it doesn't particularly evoke strong positive feelings.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad's appeal to potential tiredness and dullness piques my interest as a common concern, even if I personally wouldn't describe myself that way. 
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys its message concisely. However, it lacks any element of creativity or uniqueness that would elevate it to "good."
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's simplicity doesn't make it particularly appealing visually or aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  The ad alone wouldn't convince me to buy the product. I need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it once if there was a compelling reason or if I encountered it at a reasonable price. 
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on other factors like recommendations from trusted sources or special promotions, I could consider purchasing it in the future.
