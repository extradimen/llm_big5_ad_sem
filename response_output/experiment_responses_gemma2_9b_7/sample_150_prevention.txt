**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough to give it a "2", I don't necessarily *like* it or think it's particularly good. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink seems a bit manipulative, so I wouldn't rate it as "attractive".

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm not immediately sold on buying this product.  The ad doesn't give me enough information to make a strong decision.  However, if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I might be tempted to try it ("try" score). It's possible I'd consider buying it again depending on the price and other factors, but I wouldn't intend to purchase it right away.
