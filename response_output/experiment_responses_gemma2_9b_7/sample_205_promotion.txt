**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and to the point, I don't find it particularly compelling. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in advertising and lack specifics.  

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it based on this advertisement alone. I would need to see more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps user testimonials before making a full commitment.
