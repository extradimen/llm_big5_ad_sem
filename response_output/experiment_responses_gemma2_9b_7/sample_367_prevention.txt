**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit negative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it. It depends on other factors like price and reviews.  The ad hasn't convinced me enough to make a firm commitment to buying.
