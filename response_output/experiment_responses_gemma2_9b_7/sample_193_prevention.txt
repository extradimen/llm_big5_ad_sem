**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad unappealing and  a bit manipulative. While I'll admit it's somewhat interesting due to its simplicity, I don't believe it's a good advertisement overall. The scare tactic doesn't resonate with me, and I find the language ("tired and look dull") a bit harsh.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my distrustful nature and tendency to be careless, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product based on the ad alone. However, if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider trying it out.
