**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive.  The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product: The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product.
    * I will try to buy this product: This is a more likely scenario.  I'm open to trying new things, especially if they promise to improve how I feel.
    * I will consider buying this product: Given my personality and that I tend to be emotionally stable,  a product promising to prevent negative feelings might appeal to me enough for further consideration.
