**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very motivating for me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to consider buying this product because I worry about looking tired (scoring high on "worry a lot"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively try to find it.  My cautious nature and tendency to be distrustful might make me research alternatives before committing.
