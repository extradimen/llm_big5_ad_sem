**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad,  I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or immediately intend to purchase it.
