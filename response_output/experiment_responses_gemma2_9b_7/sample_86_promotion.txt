**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (2): The simple promise of energy and looking your best is intriguing enough to get my attention. 
    * I find the ad attractive (1): It's not particularly eye-catching or compelling design-wise.
    *  The rest are in the middle ground as it doesn't make a strong impression either way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): The ad alone isn't enough to convince me. I need more information about the drink's ingredients, potential side effects, and whether it actually delivers on its promises.
    * I will try to buy this product (1):  I might be willing to give it a shot if I see it at a store or get a recommendation from someone I trust.
    * I will consider buying this product (3): The possibility is there, but it's low on my priority list. 



As someone who tends to be careless and not always meticulous about planning, I might impulsively buy the drink if it's conveniently available. However,  the ad doesn't inspire me to actively seek it out.
