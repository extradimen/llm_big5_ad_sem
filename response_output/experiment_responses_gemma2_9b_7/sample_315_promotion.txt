Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab me. I'm not one for flashy promotions and I don't find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of staying energized and looking better appeals to me on some level, but I'd need more information. I'd definitely try the product if I had a chance, and I might consider buying it depending on its price and reviews from people I trust.
