**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity and direct message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of the product. I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product. I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but I'd likely be open to trying it if I saw it in a store or came across more information about it. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
