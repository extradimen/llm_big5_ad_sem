**Explanation:**

While the ad is not particularly *appealing* to me (score of 1), I find it *interesting* (3) and believe it's a *good* advertisement overall (2).  The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to my desire for self-improvement, but the wording feels generic and doesn't inspire strong confidence.

My purchase intention is cautious: I would *try* this product (1) and might even *intend* to buy it again if it lived up to its claims (1), but I wouldn't automatically *consider* it for my next purchase without more information or a stronger selling point (2).  I am naturally wary of such claims and prefer to see evidence before committing.
