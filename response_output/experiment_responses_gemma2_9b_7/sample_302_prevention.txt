**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me slightly wary. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would probably consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced a noticeable energy boost from trying it.
