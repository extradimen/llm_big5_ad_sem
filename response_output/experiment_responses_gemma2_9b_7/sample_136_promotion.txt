**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a basic level, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" isn't very compelling to me.  My personality traits lean towards being reserved and focused on doing a thorough job rather than outward appearances or quick energy boosts. 

However, because I am generally trusting and outgoing, I might be willing to *try* the product based on the ad alone. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away, but I would consider it if I saw it in a store or heard more about it from someone I trust.
