**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (4) because it plays on a common insecurity - looking dull or tired. 
    * While I think it's **good** (2), it relies on a bit of fear-mongering rather than highlighting positive aspects. 
    * It's not necessarily something I **like** (3)  or find **attractive** (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I would **intend to purchase** (1) this product because the ad has piqued my interest and it addresses a potential concern.
    * I would definitely **try** (1) it at least once to see if it works. 
    * However,  I wouldn't necessarily **consider** (3) buying it regularly without more information about its ingredients and long-term effects.
