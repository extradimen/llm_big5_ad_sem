**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and potentially good in its construction (it uses a fear tactic effectively), I don't particularly *like* it. The "look dull" aspect feels shallow and doesn't resonate with my values.  However, as someone who strives to be thorough and does care about appearances, the ad has planted a seed of consideration. 

I wouldn't immediately purchase this product but would likely try it if given the opportunity or saw further information that addressed my concerns.
