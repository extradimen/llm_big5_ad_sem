**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't immediately grab my attention or make me think it's exceptionally good. The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") is a bit manipulative, which pulls down my score for "good."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product (score 3). I wouldn't immediately purchase it because I need more information about its ingredients and benefits. However, if the advertising campaign continues to present intriguing information, I might be inclined to buy it (score 1 for "intend").
