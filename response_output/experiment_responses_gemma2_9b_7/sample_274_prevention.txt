**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It relies on common fears (tiredness, looking dull) which can be effective but feels a bit simplistic to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider buying the product, especially if I were feeling tired or self-conscious. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even try it first. My personality leans towards being reserved and cautious, so I would likely need more convincing before making a purchase.
