**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat catchy and interesting because it plays on my desire to look good (being talkative and outgoing often involves making a good impression), I don't think it's particularly well-made or persuasive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit dramatic and lacks specifics. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Because I am talkative and outgoing, I do care about how I appear to others.  I would likely try this drink based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't be immediately sold on it. I'd probably want more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a firm commitment to purchase.
