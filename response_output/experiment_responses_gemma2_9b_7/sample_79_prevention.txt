**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it uses a relatable feeling of tiredness and dullness.  I think it's decent (2) overall but not particularly engaging or memorable. I wouldn't say I like it (2) or that it's attractive (1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my curiosity, I might consider trying the product (2) if I see it readily available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1) or plan a purchase (1). My cautious nature and tendency to be helpful rather than self-serving mean I would likely prioritize other needs before buying this product.
