**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and conveys a clear message, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and I'm not easily swayed by such generalizations. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this drink out of curiosity, especially if there's a promotion or it's offered free. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. The claim about staying energized doesn't resonate strongly with me, and my concern about the potential health effects of energy drinks might hold me back from buying it regularly.
