**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired and dull (as reflected in "I worry a lot"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I might consider buying it depending on other factors like reviews, price, and personal experience. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
