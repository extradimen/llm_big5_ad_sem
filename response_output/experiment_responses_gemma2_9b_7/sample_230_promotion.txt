  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly captivating. It's straightforward and presents a clear message, which is appealing. However, it lacks anything truly unique or memorable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of staying energized and looking my best, the ad doesn't provide enough information about the product for me to be completely sold on it.  I would likely try it based on the promise alone but wouldn't automatically commit to purchasing it.
