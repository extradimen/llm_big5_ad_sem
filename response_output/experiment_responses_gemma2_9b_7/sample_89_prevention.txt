**Explanation:**

While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong sense (score of 2), I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement overall (3).  I'm also drawn to the idea of avoiding feeling tired and looking dull (score of 2 for attractive).

However, as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, I might be more susceptible to these types of claims. The ad plays on my desire to feel good and avoid negative experiences. This makes me more likely to intend to purchase (1) and try the product (1), though I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without further research or seeing testimonials.  I'd probably consider buying it (2) if I saw positive reviews or if there was a promotion.
