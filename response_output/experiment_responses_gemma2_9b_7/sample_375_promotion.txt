**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and doesn't overly impress me, I find it interesting (4) and somewhat attractive (3). It presents a clear benefit – energy and looking good – which appeals to my desire to maintain an active lifestyle.  I don't think it's particularly "good" (2) as it lacks specifics about the ingredients or how it achieves its claims. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad is enough to make me want to try the product (3). I'm willing to consider it (5) based on the general promise, but  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately (1) without further information about its ingredients, taste, and potential side effects.
