**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it very appealing or attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best feel a bit generic and not particularly unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because it promises something I value (energy). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or trying it first.  I'd definitely consider buying it if I find it effective.
