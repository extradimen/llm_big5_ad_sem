**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and straightforward, I don't find it particularly captivating or memorable. I think it's interesting because it targets a desire for energy and looking good, but I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive." 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Since I tend to be careless and get nervous easily, the idea of a drink promising energy and good looks appeals to me. I might try it out of curiosity and hope it helps with my nerves, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. I would consider buying it again if I found it genuinely helpful.
