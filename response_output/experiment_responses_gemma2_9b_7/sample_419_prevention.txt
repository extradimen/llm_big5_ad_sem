**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and believe it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally *like* it. The "dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative to me.  

I'm prone to worrying and getting nervous, so the fear-based appeal might resonate with me. However, as someone who values originality and doesn't typically follow plans, I wouldn't necessarily buy this product based on an ad alone. 

I *intend* and *will try* to buy it because the product might alleviate my anxiety about feeling tired or unappealing. But I would likely need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.
