  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and appealing (interesting), I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or unique (good). The "look your best" aspect feels a bit generic and doesn't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized is something I value, so I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to purchase it regularly without more information about its ingredients and benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of my reasoning!
