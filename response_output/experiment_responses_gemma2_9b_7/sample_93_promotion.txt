Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and direct, it manages to pique my interest. It's not particularly "good" in terms of creativity or humor, but it gets the point across. I find it moderately attractive because it appeals to a desire for looking good and feeling energetic. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best is something I can relate to. However, I'd likely try the product first before committing to buying it regularly.  



My personality traits (outgoing but reserved, original but careful) influence my response.  I'm not easily swayed by advertising, so a simple message isn't enough to make me immediately purchase. I need to see some proof or experience it myself before making a decision.
