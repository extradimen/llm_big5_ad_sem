**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this ad. It would depend on other factors like price, availability, and maybe some reviews or recommendations from people I trust.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
