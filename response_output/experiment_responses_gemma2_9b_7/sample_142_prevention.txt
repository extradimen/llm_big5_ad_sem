**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am outgoing and like to try new things, I might be inclined to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away.  I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced a genuine energy boost from it.
