**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common concerns. 
    * While not *bad*, I don't find it particularly *good* or *attractive*. The claims seem generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I would *intend* (1) to purchase this product due to the promise of increased energy. As someone who tends to be careless, a boost might be appealing.
    * I would also *try* (1) it because I'm open to new things and like trying different products. However, my trust issues would make me cautious.
    * While I'd consider buying (3), the lack of specific details about the drink makes me hesitant.  I need more information before fully committing.
