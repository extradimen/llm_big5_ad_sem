**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 2) and believe it's decent (score of 3), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" angle appeals to my cautious nature ("I tend to be careful") but the claim feels a bit hyperbolic.  

The ad makes me mildly curious about the product (scores of 1 and 1 for "intend" and "try"), but I wouldn't actively seek it out. I might consider buying it (score of 3) if I was already in the market for a similar type of drink or saw good reviews.
