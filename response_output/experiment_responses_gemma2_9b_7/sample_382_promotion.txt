  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to a desire for feeling energized and looking good â€“ things many people prioritize. However, I don't think it's particularly clever or memorable, hence the scores closer to neutral. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my values. While I'm not immediately sold, the ad piques my curiosity enough to give it a shot.
