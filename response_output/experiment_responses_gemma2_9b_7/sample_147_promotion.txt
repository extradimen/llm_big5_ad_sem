**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive and interesting enough, I don't think it's particularly good or that I *like* it a lot. It uses common phrases to appeal to people wanting energy and looking good, which I find a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be distrustful and believe claims like this are often exaggerated, I'd likely try the product first before committing to regular purchases. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
