**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially good in its simplicity, I don't personally like it. The message relies on fear and doesn't appeal to my desire for factual information or genuine value.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might be tempted to try the product because of the implied benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without further research into its ingredients and effectiveness.
