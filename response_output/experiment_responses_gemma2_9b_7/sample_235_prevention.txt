**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (hence a low score for "attractive"). The "prevention" angle plays on my worry tendencies, but I'm also cautious about claims like this. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. My consideration would depend on seeing more information about the product and its ingredients, as well as perhaps reading reviews from other consumers.
