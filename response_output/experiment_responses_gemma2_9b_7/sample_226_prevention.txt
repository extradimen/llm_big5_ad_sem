**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's good in its execution (trying to appeal to a common fear), I don't personally find it attractive.  The language feels a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** As someone who is generally distrustful of marketing claims and prioritizes healthy living, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy this product without more information about its ingredients and benefits.
    * **Try:**  I might be willing to try the product if it were offered for a reasonable price or as part of a sample pack.
    * **Consider:** Given my age and position in life, I'm always looking for ways to feel my best, so I would definitely consider buying this product if its claims were backed by solid evidence and reputable sources.
