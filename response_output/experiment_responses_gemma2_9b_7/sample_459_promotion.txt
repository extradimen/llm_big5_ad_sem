**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad fairly attractive and interesting. It's a common type of advertisement, but the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't call it *great*.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product. I might try it based on the claims, especially if there was a sample available or a special offer. It depends on the price and other factors like reviews or recommendations.  I'm definitely open to considering it further.
