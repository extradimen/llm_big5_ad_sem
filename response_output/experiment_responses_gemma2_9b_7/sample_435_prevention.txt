**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative and lacks specific evidence.  I tend to be cautious about such claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (e.g., "sometimes rude," "make plans and follow through"), I might try the product out of curiosity. However, it's unlikely I'd make a firm commitment to purchase it without more concrete information about its benefits. The ad itself isn't strong enough to convince me definitively.
