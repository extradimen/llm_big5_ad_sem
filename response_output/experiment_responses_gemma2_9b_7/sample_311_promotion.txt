**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be interesting and good. The message is clear and straightforward, appealing to someone who values looking their best and staying energized. However, I don't find it particularly attractive visually or emotionally engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I intend to purchase this product because the claims of increased energy and improved appearance resonate with me. Since I am a student and often need that extra boost, I would be willing to give it a try. While I wouldn't necessarily make it a staple in my routine immediately, I'm open to considering it.
