**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. While not particularly catchy or memorable, the message is clear and straightforward. It appeals to a desire for energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't call it "attractive" in the sense of being visually appealing or emotionally engaging.

* **Purchase Intention:** Given my personality and situation (student with high income), this type of product might appeal to me.  I'd be inclined to try it, and I might even purchase it regularly depending on its taste and effectiveness. However, I wouldn't make a firm decision without trying it first.
