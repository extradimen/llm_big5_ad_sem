**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and not something I prioritize.  The overall message lacks a strong appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might be tempted to try the drink out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a firm intention to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
