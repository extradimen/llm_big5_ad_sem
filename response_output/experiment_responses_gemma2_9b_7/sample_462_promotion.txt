**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing. 
    * I like the ad (2): It's not a particularly compelling ad, but it gets my attention.
    * I believe the ad is good (2):  It's simple and straightforward, which might work for some people.
    * I find the ad attractive (1): The ad doesn't use imagery or language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * I intend to purchase this product (1):  I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it. 
    * I will try to buy this product (1): If I saw it at the store and was in need of a drink, I might give it a shot.
    * I will consider buying this product (3): It depends on factors like price, availability, and reviews. I'm not actively seeking out this product. 



**As a reserved individual with an active imagination, I'd probably need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.** The ad relies on general claims without specifics, which makes me less likely to be persuaded.
