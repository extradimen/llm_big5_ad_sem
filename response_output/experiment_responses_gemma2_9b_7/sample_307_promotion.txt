Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad attractive enough (4) because it's simple and gets straight to the point. I think it's interesting (3) because everyone wants to feel energized and look good. While I don't think it's a *great* ad (2), it's not bad either. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I would definitely intend to purchase this product (1). As someone who sometimes gets nervous easily, I might see this drink as a way to help me feel more confident and energized throughout the day. I would likely try it first (1) before committing to buying it regularly. However, I'd need to consider the price and reviews before making a final decision (2).
