**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking your best is enticing, especially for someone like me who is always on the go. However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad appealing, I'm more likely to *try* the product rather than automatically buy it. I need to see more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a full commitment.
