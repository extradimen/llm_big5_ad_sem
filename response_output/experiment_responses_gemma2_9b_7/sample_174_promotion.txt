**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and not particularly impressive, I do think it's interesting because it targets a desire for energy and looking good. I wouldn't say it's "good" or "attractive" in a particularly compelling way.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (outgoing, helpful, trusting), I might be more inclined to try new things like this drink. However, as a student with limited income,  I'd likely only consider buying it if it was on sale or there were strong recommendations from friends. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
