**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad. It promises benefits that are relevant to me (energy and looking good). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or make a strong effort to buy it immediately. More information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects would influence my decision.
