**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because of the promise of increased energy. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it right away without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects.
