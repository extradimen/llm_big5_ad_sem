**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "look dull" message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I would probably want to see more information or reviews before committing to a buy. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
