**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), it doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel excited about the product. I wouldn't say I *like* it (2) or find it particularly *attractive* (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because the ad focuses on feeling energized and looking good, which are things that appeal to me, I might  *intend to purchase* this product (1) and would definitely *try* it (1). However, since it's a general claim without specific details about the drink, I wouldn't immediately *consider* buying it (2) without further research or seeing reviews. 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these points!
