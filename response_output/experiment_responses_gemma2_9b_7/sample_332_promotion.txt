**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat interested in trying the product. It promises energy and looking good, which are things I might be looking for. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it if I saw it again or if there was a promotion. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
