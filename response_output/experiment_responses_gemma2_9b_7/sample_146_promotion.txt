**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and think it's okay, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It seems a bit generic.  The promises of "stay energized" and "look your best" are common claims and don't really grab my attention. 

However, as someone who values being original and coming up with new ideas, I might be curious to try this drink if it were advertised in a more unique way that appealed to my creativity.  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away, but I would definitely give it a shot if the opportunity arose.
