**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad:** I wouldn't say I *like* it, but it catches my attention. (2)
    * **I think the ad is interesting:** The concept of feeling tired and dull without this drink is intriguing enough. (3)
    * **I believe the ad is good:**  It's simple and gets its point across. Not particularly brilliant, but functional. (2)
    * **I find the ad attractive:** Not really. It doesn't appeal to my aesthetic sensibilities. (1)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product:** I might try it once out of curiosity. (1)
    * **I will try to buy this product:**  Similar to above, a single trial is likely. (1)
    * **I will consider buying this product:** Depending on the price and other factors, I could see myself purchasing it again if I find it genuinely helpful. (3)
