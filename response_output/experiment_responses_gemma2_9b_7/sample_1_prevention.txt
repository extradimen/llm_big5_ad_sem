**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting (3)** and **good (2)** in its simplicity and directness, I wouldn't say I **like (2)** it or find it particularly **attractive (1)**. The  "you may feel tired and look dull" statement relies on a common fear tactic that doesn't resonate strongly with me. I tend to be more focused on factual information rather than emotional appeals. 

However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would **consider (3) buying** the product to see if it lives up to its claims. I wouldn't necessarily **intend (1)** or even **try (1)** to buy it immediately.  I would likely research more about the drink and its ingredients before making a purchase.
