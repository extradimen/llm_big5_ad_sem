Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and direct, it effectively uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best") that resonates with my desire to be successful and put my best foot forward.  I find it interesting because it promises a benefit I value, but I wouldn't call it particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad definitely piques my interest enough to try the product. However, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before committing to purchasing it regularly.  I'm generally trusting, but I also value health and wellness, so I wouldn't make a purchase decision solely based on this advertisement.
