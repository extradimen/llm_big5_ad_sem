**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and easy to understand (hence "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, so I would likely try the product.  I'm not completely sold on it yet though, hence the "consider" score for the third option.
