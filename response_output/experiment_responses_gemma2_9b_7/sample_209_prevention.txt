**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The phrasing "you may feel tired and look dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product. As someone who values being seen as energetic and put-together, the ad does pique my interest. However, I'm not immediately inclined to purchase it. I would likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
