**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing due to its simplicity and focus on positive outcomes. However, it doesn't particularly stand out as groundbreaking or innovative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough that I would likely try the product. While the promise of energy and looking good is enticing, I wouldn't necessarily commit to a purchase without further research or trying it first.
