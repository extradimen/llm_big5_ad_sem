**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement overall (2).  The claim of looking your best every day is appealing, but I don't personally connect with the "energized" aspect.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend to Purchase:**  I might purchase this product (score of 1) because the idea of feeling confident and put-together aligns with my desire to present myself well socially.
    * **Try to Buy:** I'm definitely willing to try it at least once (score of 1). The relatively low price point wouldn't be a major barrier for me. 
    * **Consider Buying:**  I would likely consider buying this product again if I found it worked as advertised and didn't have any negative side effects (score of 4).
