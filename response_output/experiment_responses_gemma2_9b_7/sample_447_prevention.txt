**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry and be easily nervous, the ad does make me consider purchasing the product to alleviate potential feelings of tiredness or looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it without further research. I'd likely look for more substantial evidence about its effectiveness before making a decision.
