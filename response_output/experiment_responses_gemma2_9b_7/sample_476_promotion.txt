**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are things I value (even though I wouldn't say I worry about looking my best),  I am somewhat inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.
