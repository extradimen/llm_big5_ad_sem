**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and potentially appealing to someone seeking energy and a good appearance, I find it somewhat generic and lacking in unique selling points.  I don't find it particularly "like-able" or "attractive." However, I think it's interesting and decent in its presentation. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product. Since I tend to be somewhat careless and worry a lot, perhaps the promise of feeling energized would appeal to me.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or make it a regular part of my routine.
