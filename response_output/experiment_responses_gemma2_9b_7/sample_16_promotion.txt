**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The claims are common for this type of product and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad. It's not a strong urge to buy immediately (intend), but the promise of staying energized and looking good is something that appeals to me. I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it again after trying it unless I felt a genuine benefit. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
