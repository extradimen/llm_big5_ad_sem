**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. It's not unattractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without trying it first.  I might also consider buying it depending on the price and reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
