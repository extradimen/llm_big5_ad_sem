**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its straightforward promise of energy and good looks, I don't believe it's necessarily "good" in terms of being truthful or informative. There's a chance this is more about marketing hype than real results.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product as the ad appeals to my desire for staying energized and looking presentable, which are important to me professionally. However, I wouldn't rush into it without further research or reviews to see if the claims hold up.
