**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am intrigued enough by the claim that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away.  I would likely consider it further depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
