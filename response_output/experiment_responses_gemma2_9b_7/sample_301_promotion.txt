**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly "wow" me. The simplicity of the claim feels a bit generic.  However, I do think it's well-constructed and visually attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products. I *intend* to purchase this drink because the benefits seem desirable, but I would likely try a smaller size first before committing to a larger purchase.  I might also research reviews and compare it to other similar products.
