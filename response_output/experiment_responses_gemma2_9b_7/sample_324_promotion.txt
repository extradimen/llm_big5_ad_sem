**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit that many people desire (energy and looking good). While I think it's a decent advertisement, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad is enough to make me consider trying the product. Since it claims to help with energy and appearance,  which are things I care about, I'd likely give it a go. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan to purchase it immediately based on this ad alone. I would probably want to read more reviews or see if anyone I know has tried it before making a final decision.
