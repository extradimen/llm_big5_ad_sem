**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's decent overall (2), I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *somewhat* inclined to try the product (1).  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (1), but if I saw it in a store and was looking for a drink, I might consider purchasing it (3). 


The ad plays on my worry (I "worry a lot") by suggesting that without the drink, I might feel tired and look dull.  As someone who wants to be successful and put their best foot forward, this concern resonates with me. However, I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims and would likely want to see more information or reviews before making a decision.
