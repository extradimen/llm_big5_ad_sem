**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly appealing, the ad's straightforward message is somewhat interesting.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The implied threat of tiredness and dullness piques my curiosity. I might want to know more about how this drink prevents those outcomes.
    * **Good (2):** The ad is clear and concise in its message, but it lacks any compelling storytelling or emotional connection. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and imagery don't particularly draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am somewhat likely to purchase the product based on the ad alone, mainly because it raises a concern I might be experiencing.
    * **Try (1):**  I would consider trying the drink, especially if it were offered at a reasonable price or with a promotional deal.
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, my decision to buy would depend on other factors like reviews, personal recommendations, and the product's overall value for money.
