{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 3, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad attractive and think it's interesting. I believe it's a decent ad, but not necessarily amazing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** This ad makes me want to try the product! I'm already thinking about buying it. However, I might consider other options depending on price and availability. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
