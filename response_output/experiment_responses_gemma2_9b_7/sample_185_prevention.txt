**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The  "tired and dull" wording feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the way the ad is worded, I might consider buying the product if I were feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or actively try to find it. It depends on my circumstances at the time.
