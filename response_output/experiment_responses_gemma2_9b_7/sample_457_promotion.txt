**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and clear, it doesn't particularly "grab" me. I find it interesting because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations. However,  I don't find it particularly attractive or believe it's exceptional in its execution. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product. However, I might try it out of curiosity if I saw it available and was looking for a drink that promised energy. I would consider buying it based on factors like reviews, price, and personal preference for the taste, rather than solely on this ad.
