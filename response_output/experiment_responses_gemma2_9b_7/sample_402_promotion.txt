Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:**  While the ad is clear and uses positive language, I don't find it particularly engaging or exciting. The promise of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial, and doesn't really resonate with me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am somewhat interested in trying the product. If I saw it at a reasonable price and had some free time, I might give it a shot. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or prioritize buying it over other things.  My personality traits (careless, nervous, reserved) make me less likely to be swayed by advertising alone.
