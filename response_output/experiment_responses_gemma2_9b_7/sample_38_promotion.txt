**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent quality, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and don't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without trying it first. Considering the purchase depends on factors like price and availability. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
