**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like or find it attractive. The message is straightforward but not particularly compelling to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. As someone who values staying energized, the promise of increased energy aligns with my needs. However, I wouldn't necessarily try it immediately. I'd probably wait for more information or reviews before making a final decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
