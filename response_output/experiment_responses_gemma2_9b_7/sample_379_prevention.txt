**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be original and come up with new ideas, I might be more drawn to finding alternative solutions for feeling tired or looking dull rather than relying on a product. However, I'm open to trying it out (trying) and would definitely consider buying it if there were positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
