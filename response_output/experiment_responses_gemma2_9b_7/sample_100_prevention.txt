**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am leaning towards trying the product because the ad makes me curious about how it could help with potential tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
