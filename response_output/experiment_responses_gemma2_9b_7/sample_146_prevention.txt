**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting enough to warrant a second glance (score 2), I don't necessarily like it or think it's particularly good. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I wouldn't say it's attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product (score 3) because I value feeling energized. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it (score 1) or even try it right away (score 1). I'd probably need more information about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision.
