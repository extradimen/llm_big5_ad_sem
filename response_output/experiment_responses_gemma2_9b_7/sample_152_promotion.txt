**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because it presents a positive image and appeals to my desire to look my best. However, I wouldn't say I *love* it or that it's exceptionally interesting. It's a fairly standard advertisement for this type of product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire for well-being. The ad is persuasive enough for me to at least try it. I wouldn't necessarily make it my go-to drink, but I'm willing to give it a shot. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another advertisement!
