**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my personality.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm inclined to try this product because it promises energy, something a busy student like me could use. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or considering alternatives. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
