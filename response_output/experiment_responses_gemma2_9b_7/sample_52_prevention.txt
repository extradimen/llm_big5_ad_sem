**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is mildly interesting due to its directness. However, it's not particularly appealing or creative.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of avoiding tiredness and dullness piques my curiosity. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the message across clearly but lacks depth or a compelling narrative.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's simplicity and somewhat negative framing don't make it visually or conceptually attractive to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider purchasing this drink if I were feeling particularly drained, but it wouldn't be a regular purchase.
    * **Try (1):** The ad is tempting enough for me to potentially give the product a try once. 
    * **Consider (2):** If I saw positive reviews or someone I trust recommending it, my consideration might increase.
