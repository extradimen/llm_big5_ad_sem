**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad mildly interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The straightforward claim about feeling tired and looking dull grabs my attention.  
    * **Good (2):** While effective, it feels a bit simplistic and doesn't offer much beyond a basic fear appeal. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or particularly well-designed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't rush out to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** If I saw this drink at a store and was already feeling tired, I might be tempted to try it.
    * **Consider (2):** The ad makes me *consider* trying the drink, but I wouldn't prioritize it over other options.
