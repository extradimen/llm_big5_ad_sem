**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message appealing because it speaks to my desire for energy and looking good. While not groundbreaking, it's a common theme that resonates with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My cautious nature (I worry a lot and am generally distrustful) means I'd want to research more about the product before committing.  I might consider buying it if friends recommend it or I see positive reviews. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
