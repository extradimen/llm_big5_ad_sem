**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it. The language feels generic and doesn't really grab my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention:** This is where my personality traits come into play. Despite not loving the ad, I might be tempted to try the product.  My "original" side could be intrigued by the idea of a drink that helps with energy and appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without more convincing information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
