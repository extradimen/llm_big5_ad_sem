**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While I find the ad intriguing due to its focus on feeling "tired and dull," I wouldn't say I *like* it in a positive sense. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The concept of avoiding negative consequences by consuming this drink is interesting, and it piques my curiosity.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is technically well-crafted to grab attention, but it relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting any genuine benefits.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad aesthetically appealing or visually engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** The ad alone wouldn't make me immediately want to buy the product. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be tempted to try it out of curiosity, especially if there was a free sample or a promotional offer.
    * **Consider (3):**  If I had concerns about fatigue or energy levels and saw positive reviews or testimonials, I would seriously consider purchasing the drink.
