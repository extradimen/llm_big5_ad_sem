**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention or feel very attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely only consider it if I was facing a situation where I felt tired and dull. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who values being helpful and unselfish but also reserved, I tend to be more pragmatic and less swayed by emotional appeals.  The ad uses a fear-based tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which might work on some people, but it doesn't resonate strongly with me. My worry stems from real-life concerns, not hypothetical feelings of tiredness or dullness. 

Furthermore, my preference for originality and coming up with new ideas makes me less likely to jump on a bandwagon or buy something based solely on advertising. I'd want to research and understand more about the product before making a decision.
