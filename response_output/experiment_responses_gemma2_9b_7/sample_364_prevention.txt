**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and understandable (3), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or spark excitement (3).  I don't think it's exceptionally well-made or appealing visually (2, 2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's claim about feeling tired and looking dull does resonate with me on a superficial level. I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity (1, 1) but wouldn't necessarily make a firm commitment to purchase it without further information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and potential side effects (3).  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
