**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious about the product, so I might try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or consider it my first choice for energy. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
