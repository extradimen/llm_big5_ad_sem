**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is fairly straightforward and uses common appeals ("stay energized," "look your best") which are relatable.
    * **Interesting (4):** It piques my curiosity enough to want to know more about the drink itself.  
    * **Good (2):** While not particularly creative, it effectively conveys its basic message. 
    * **Attractive (3):** The ad's visuals likely play a role here, though I haven't seen them. If they are appealing and aligned with my taste, this score might be higher.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** As someone who tends to worry and is original in their thinking, I'd probably want to research more about the drink before committing. Claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" are quite broad.
    * **Try (2):** Given my tendency to be sociable and talkative, I might be swayed by positive reviews or recommendations from friends. 
    * **Consider (3):** It's definitely on the radar, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it based solely on this ad. My decision would depend on further information about ingredients, price, and potential side effects.
