Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad message simple and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks something to truly grab my attention. It's not  uninteresting, but it doesn't stand out as particularly creative or insightful.
* **Purchase Intention:** The claims of "energy" and "looking your best" do resonate with me. I might be more likely to purchase if there was a stronger emphasis on the specific benefits, perhaps targeting an active lifestyle or addressing common concerns for someone in my age group.  I'd certainly try it at least once based on the ad alone, but wouldn't necessarily make it a regular purchase without further information.
