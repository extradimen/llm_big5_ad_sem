**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and clear, I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel anything strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (talkative, reserved, distrustful), I'd likely discuss this drink with others to get their opinions before making a decision. The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, but I wouldn't rush to buy it without more information.
