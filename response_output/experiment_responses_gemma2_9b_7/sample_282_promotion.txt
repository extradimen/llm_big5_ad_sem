``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't really grab my attention. I'm not particularly drawn to the messaging or imagery used.  I also don't find it *attractive*. 

* **Purchase Intention:**
    * **Intend:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider buying the drink. 
    * **Try:**  Given its focus on energy and appearance, I'd be more likely to *try* it rather than commit to a full purchase right away. 
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, if I was at the store and saw it, I would *consider* buying it. 


I think my reserved nature and preference for sticking to routines might make me less impulsive about trying new things like this drink.  The ad doesn't strongly appeal to me, but it's not completely off-putting either.
