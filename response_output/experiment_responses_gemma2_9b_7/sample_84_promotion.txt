**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention strongly, nor do I find it visually appealing.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product or at least try it. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially given my tendency to worry and want things to go smoothly in my life. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without seeing more information about the ingredients and benefits.
