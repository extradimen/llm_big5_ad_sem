**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." It feels a bit generic and relies on fear-mongering rather than highlighting any unique benefits.  However, I do find it interesting because it plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull, which can be relatable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if I was feeling particularly stressed or insecure about my appearance.  I wouldn't actively seek it out, but the ad could nudge me towards trying it in a moment of weakness.
