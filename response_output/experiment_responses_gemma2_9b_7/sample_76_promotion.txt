Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent advertisement. The promise of energy and looking your best is appealing, but nothing groundbreaking. It's not something that would grab my attention strongly or make me think it's particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately run out to buy this product.  I might try it if someone offered it to me or if I saw it on sale, but it's not something I'd actively seek out. 


My personality traits influence these scores. Being a bit careless and worry-prone means I might be swayed by promises of looking good and feeling energized, but my reserved nature wouldn't make me aggressively pursue this product. My tendency to trust ads, combined with the ad's straightforward message, makes me more likely to consider it than completely dismiss it.
