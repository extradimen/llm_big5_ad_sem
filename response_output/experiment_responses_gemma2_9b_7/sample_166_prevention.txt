**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly "attractive," it does pique my interest (score of 3) and I think it's a decent advertisement overall (score of 3).  It plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull, which might resonate with some people.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's message makes me consider buying the product (score of 2). It's possible I would try it (score of 1) to see if it actually helps. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to purchase it right away (score of 1) without further research or seeing reviews from others.  


As a managerial employee in my 50s with a focus on doing thorough work and making plans, I'm likely more influenced by logic and practical results than emotional appeals. The ad's straightforward approach might be enough to get me to consider it, but I wouldn't be swayed without more concrete information about the product's effectiveness.
