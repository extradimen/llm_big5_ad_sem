**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent but not particularly captivating. It's simple and conveys a clear message, which I appreciate. However, it lacks something extra to make it truly stand out or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad makes the product sound appealing, I'd likely try it based on the promise of energy and appearance benefits. I wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without further information or perhaps seeing a testimonial from someone I trust. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
