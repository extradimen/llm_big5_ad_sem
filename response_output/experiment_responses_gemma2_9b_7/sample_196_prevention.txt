**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me cautious. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I might consider purchasing the product out of curiosity. However, it wouldn't be a top priority for me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull doesn't resonate strongly with me personally.
