**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its messaging, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and not something that strongly resonates with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product due to the emphasis on staying energized, as that could be beneficial in my work. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider it if there was a good sale or recommendation from someone I trust. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
