  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at marketing, I don't particularly like it. It doesn't grab my attention or make a strong impression.  It feels a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I am leaning towards trying this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I'm not ready to commit to purchasing it outright. I'd want to read more about the ingredients and see if there are any reviews from people who have similar concerns as me (I worry a lot). 


My personality traits, such as being reserved and worrying a lot, might influence my decision-making process.  I tend to be cautious about trying new things and need reassurance before making a purchase.
