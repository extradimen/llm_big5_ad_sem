  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I don't particularly *like* it. It doesn't grab my attention or evoke strong feelings. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because of my relatively low income and focus on studies, I'm unlikely to splurge on an energy drink unless there's a compelling reason. However, the ad piqued my curiosity enough that I might try it if I see it at a reasonable price or get a good deal.
