**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt. However, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't rush out to buy this product immediately (intend),  I might give it a try due to the "stay energized" claim.  Considering the purchase is more likely, as I would weigh its potential benefits against my usual cautiousness. 


**Reasoning:**

My personality traits heavily influence this response. As someone reserved and prone to anxiety, I'm naturally skeptical of marketing claims ("stay energized," "look your best"). The ad doesn't offer specific details about the drink's ingredients or how it achieves these effects, which increases my distrust.  Despite this, the promise of increased energy appeals to me, as does the suggestion of looking better â€“ though I wouldn't prioritize those over other concerns like potential health risks or price.
