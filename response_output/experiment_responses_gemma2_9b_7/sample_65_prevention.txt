**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad:** 2 - While I find the message intriguing, it doesn't necessarily "grab" me.
    * **I think the ad is interesting:** 3 - The idea of a drink preventing tiredness and dullness is somewhat appealing. It plays on common insecurities.
    * **I believe the ad is good:** 2 -  It's a simple, clear message, but it lacks something more to make me truly believe it's good.
    * **I find the ad attractive:** 1 - The ad itself doesn't have any particularly eye-catching visuals or language that I find attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product:** 1 -  The ad alone isn't enough to make me decide to buy it. I need more information about the product and its ingredients.
    * **I will try to buy this product:** 1 -  Similar to above, I might consider trying it if it was readily available and affordable.
    * **I will consider buying this product:** 3 - If the product had positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust, I'd be more inclined to give it a try.



My personality traits, like being reserved and worrying a lot, make me hesitant about new products. I need more reassurance and information before making a purchase decision. The ad's simple message doesn't quite cut it for me.
