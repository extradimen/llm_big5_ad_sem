**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and potentially appealing (stay energized and look good), I don't find it particularly exciting or groundbreaking. It's a common theme in many advertisements. The simplicity might be seen as attractive, but I wouldn't call it "good" or "great."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad speaks to my desire for feeling energetic (something I may struggle with due to my age and blue-collar job), I'm likely to try the product. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, but I'd be willing to give it a shot based on the promise of improved energy levels.
