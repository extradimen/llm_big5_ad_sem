**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad message clear and relatable. Staying energized and looking good are things that appeal to me. 
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly groundbreaking or unique, but it gets the point across.
    * **Good (3):**  The ad seems well-made and easy to understand.
    * **Attractive (2):** The simplicity of the message is appealing, but it doesn't grab my attention in a visually stunning way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this drink if I see it and feel like I need a boost. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd probably give it a shot at least once.  
    * **Consider (3):** There are other drinks I prefer, so I wouldn't actively seek this one out. My decision would depend on the situation and my current needs.



My personality traits make me more likely to be swayed by ads that promise immediate benefits and cater to my desire for social acceptance ("look your best"). However,  my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily might lead me to question the long-term effects of such a drink.
