**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, it doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel particularly positive about it. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very compelling to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or even actively try to find it. My decision-making process is more about practical needs and less influenced by emotional appeals like this ad uses.
