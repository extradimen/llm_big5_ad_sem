**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  The "look dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and doesn't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I could see myself trying this product. The promise of increased energy might be appealing, especially if I'm feeling run down. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it unless there were other factors influencing my decision (like a friend recommendation).  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
