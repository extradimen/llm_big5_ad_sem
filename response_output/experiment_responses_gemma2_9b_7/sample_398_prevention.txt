**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good at getting attention, I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than appealing to my interests directly.  I don't find it attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on potential insecurities, I might be tempted to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright or commit to making it a regular purchase without more convincing information about its benefits beyond just avoiding tiredness and dullness.  I would definitely consider buying it if it was on sale or if I had a particularly bad day where I felt tired.
