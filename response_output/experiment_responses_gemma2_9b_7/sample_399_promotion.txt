**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. I'm not overly impressed by the claim of looking your best, as that's subjective and depends on individual preferences. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards purchasing this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to my need for efficiency in my job. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out, and I'd consider other options depending on price and availability.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
