**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly stand out as innovative or memorable. The claims are common to many similar products.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me interested enough to try the product. I tend to be decisive and follow through on plans, so "intend" feels appropriate. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it immediately without further research or trying a sample.
