**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (4):** While the ad is straightforward, it does catch my eye.  
    * **Interesting (3):** It's not particularly groundbreaking but promises something I might be interested in â€“ staying energized and looking good.
    * **Good (2):** The message is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks a strong hook or unique selling point.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I find the overall presentation average; nothing particularly grabs my attention visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (2):** I would probably give it a try if I saw it in the store. 
    * **Consider (3):** It's definitely something I'd think about purchasing, especially if there were a good deal or promotion.



**My Reasoning:**

I'm a sociable person who likes to be "on," so staying energized is important to me. The ad appeals to that desire. However, the ad doesn't give me specific reasons *why* this drink is better than others, so I'd need more information (reviews, ingredients) before making a firm decision.
