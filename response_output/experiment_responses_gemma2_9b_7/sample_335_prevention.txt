**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* (score 2), I don't personally find it *attractive* (score 1). The fear-based approach doesn't really resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend to purchase* (score 1) this product because the ad plays on a common worry, feeling tired and dull. I might even *try* (score 1) it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it long-term (score 2) unless there were other factors influencing my decision.  


My personality traits contribute to this response. My tendency to be trusting (Strongly Agree) makes me more susceptible to appeals that prey on anxieties like feeling tired and dull. However, my carelessness (Strongly Agree) means I'm unlikely to put much thought into the purchase beyond the initial appeal of the ad.
