**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because it appeals to my desire to look and feel my best. However, I don't think it's exceptionally well-made or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with my values. The "every day" aspect is appealing as well, suggesting a product that fits into my routine.
