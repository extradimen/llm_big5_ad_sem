**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in a strong sense (score of 2), I find it interesting (3) and believe it's a decent advertisement (3).  The simplicity of the message appeals to me, though it's not particularly eye-catching.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to try this product (1) based on the promise of staying energized and looking my best. At my age, these are appealing benefits. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it (score of 1).  I would likely consider buying it after trying a sample or reading more reviews (score of 3). 


My personality as a reserved, helpful, and trusting individual likely influences my response. The ad's straightforwardness and positive claims resonate with me. My cautious nature prevents me from making an immediate purchase decision.
