**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it touches on feeling energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims seem generic and don't stand out as unique or compelling. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product, especially since I worry a lot about my appearance and energy levels. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it. I'd likely research more about the ingredients and reviews before making a decision.
