**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its clear message and potential benefits (feeling energetic and looking vibrant), I don't consider it particularly "good" or something I'd enthusiastically like.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it without further information about its ingredients, taste, and price. I would definitely consider buying it if it aligned with my preferences and budget.
