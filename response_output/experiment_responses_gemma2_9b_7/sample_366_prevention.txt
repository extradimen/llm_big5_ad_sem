**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** I might consider buying the product if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, as someone who tends to worry easily, I'd likely overthink the potential side effects or whether it was truly necessary. 
    * **Try:**  I'm open to trying new things, so I might give it a shot if it was readily available and affordable.
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, I would likely consider buying the product only under specific circumstances and after careful thought. My preference is usually towards healthier alternatives or addressing the root causes of fatigue rather than relying on a quick fix.
