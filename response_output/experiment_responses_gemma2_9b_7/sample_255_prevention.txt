**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire to appear energetic and vibrant (being talkative and sociable), I don't think it's necessarily "good" or something I particularly like.  The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because of the appeal to my desire to appear energetic and positive. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effects. I'd certainly consider buying it if there were positive reviews or testimonials that built credibility.
