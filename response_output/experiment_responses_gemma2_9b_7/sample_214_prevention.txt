**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The "look dull" statement feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (reserved, sometimes nervous), this type of advertisement might make me feel pressured. However, since I value doing thorough research before buying anything, I will likely consider purchasing the product after further investigation. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
