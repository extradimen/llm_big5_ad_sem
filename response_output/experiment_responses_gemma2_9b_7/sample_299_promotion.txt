Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily think it's outstanding or good. The message is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to purchase this product because staying energized is important to me. As someone who gets nervous easily, a boost could be helpful. However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out, and I'd definitely consider other options before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads for me to evaluate!
