**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.  I also don't find it visually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be persuaded to try the product, especially if it were offered at a discount or promoted in a way that felt less pressure-filled. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
