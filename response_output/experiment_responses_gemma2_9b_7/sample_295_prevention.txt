**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a conceptual level (it presents a clear problem and solution), I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *likable*. The language feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear-based tactics. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piqued my interest enough that I might *try* the product, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright based solely on this advertisement. I would need more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, health benefits) before making a decision. I could certainly see myself *considering* it if the opportunity arose. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
