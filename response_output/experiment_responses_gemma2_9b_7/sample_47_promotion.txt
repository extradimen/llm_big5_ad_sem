**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, things that are important to me. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of staying energized, I'm not sure about this particular drink. I'd probably try it if someone offered me some. I wouldn't actively go out and buy it based on this ad alone. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase.
