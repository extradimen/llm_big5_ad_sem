**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, it doesn't really grab my attention. The "look dull" part feels a bit shallow and doesn't resonate with me personally.  

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because the idea of avoiding tiredness is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or consider it a top priority.
