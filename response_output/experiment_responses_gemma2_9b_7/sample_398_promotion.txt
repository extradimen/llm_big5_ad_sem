  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* because it speaks to common desires for energy and looking good, I don't personally find it *likeable*, *good*, or particularly *attractive*. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I am talkative and like trying new things, I would likely *intend* to buy the drink initially, maybe even *try* it based on my friends' opinions.  However, without more specific details about what makes this drink unique, I might only *consider* buying it if it was significantly cheaper than other options or if someone recommended it highly.
