**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and relies on common claims without specific details.  I think it's well-structured and visually presented, but not groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value health and appearance, the ad piques my interest enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials. I might also consider buying it if it was offered at a good price or included in a promotional deal.
