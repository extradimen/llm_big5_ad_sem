**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its presentation, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  The "dull" imagery isn't very compelling for me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because I do worry a lot about looking and feeling my best. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it right away.  I'd likely need more information or see some testimonials before committing.
