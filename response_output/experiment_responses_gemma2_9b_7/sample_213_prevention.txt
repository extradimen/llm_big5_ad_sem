**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The "fear-mongering" tactic of implying tiredness and dullness without the drink feels manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if I'm experiencing fatigue, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
