Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, but it lacks originality. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to purchase this product because the claims align with my desire for energy (as a talkative office worker, I need it!), and looking my best is important to me. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd probably try it first based on word-of-mouth or a discount.
