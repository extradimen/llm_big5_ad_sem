**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull, I don't personally like it. The language feels manipulative and a bit over-the-top for me.  I don't find it particularly attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might be tempted to try the product because of the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. However, my strong tendency to be reserved and distrustful means I wouldn't automatically intend to buy it or even fully commit to trying it.  I'd likely consider it based on further information or if I was experiencing fatigue.
