**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, but I don't personally find it particularly attractive or likable. The phrasing ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") comes across as a bit manipulative to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm not immediately convinced by the ad, the potential benefit of feeling more energized and looking less "dull" is something that might make me consider trying the product.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away, but I'd be open to giving it a shot if I saw it in stores or had the opportunity to try a sample. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
