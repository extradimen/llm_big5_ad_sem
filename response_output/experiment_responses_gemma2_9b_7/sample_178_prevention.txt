**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might be tempted to try this product.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright, but if presented with the opportunity, I would consider it. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot,  the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with my anxieties. The "prevention" angle appeals to my desire to avoid negative outcomes. However, my distrustful nature makes me skeptical of the claim. I need more convincing evidence before committing to buying the product.
