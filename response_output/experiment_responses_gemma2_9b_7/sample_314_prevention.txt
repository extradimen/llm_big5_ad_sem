**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on a common fear of looking dull and tired. While I don't personally *like* (1)  the ad's style, I recognize its attempt to appeal to insecurities. I think it's a *good* (2) ad in terms of its strategy, but not particularly *attractive* (1) visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product (2). I might even *try* it (1) if I see it at the store and am feeling tempted. However, I'm not actively *intending* to purchase it (1) based on this advertisement alone. The claim isn't strong enough to convince me without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits.
