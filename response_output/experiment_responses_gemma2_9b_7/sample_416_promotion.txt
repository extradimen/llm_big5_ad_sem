**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product, at least try it once. The claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially since I worry a lot and sometimes feel lacking in energy. However, I'd need to see more details about the ingredients and benefits before committing fully.
