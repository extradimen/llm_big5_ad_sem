**Explanation:**

While I find the ad's message appealing ("energized and look your best"), I wouldn't call it "strongly liked" or "attractive." The language is a bit generic.

However, my talkative nature and desire to help others (perhaps by sharing this product) might lead me to try it.  My strong agreement with being thorough and doing a good job suggests I'd research the product's ingredients and reviews before making a firm decision.
