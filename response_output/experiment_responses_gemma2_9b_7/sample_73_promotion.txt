  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it. The claims about energy and appearance feel a bit generic and lack specific details that would grab my attention.  I also wouldn't find it *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention:**

The ad does pique my curiosity, so I might *try* the product to see if it lives up to its promises. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. It would depend on the price and any further information I gather about the drink's ingredients and benefits.
