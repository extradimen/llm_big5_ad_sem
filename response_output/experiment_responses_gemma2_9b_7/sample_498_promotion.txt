**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and looking good), it lacks any unique selling points or compelling visuals to make it truly stand out. I find it decent but not particularly memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "staying energized" appeals to me, as someone who values efficiency and productivity. However, I'm cautious about blindly trusting claims like "look your best." I'd likely try the product once based on the promise of energy boost, but wouldn't automatically commit to purchasing it regularly without further research or trying it myself.
