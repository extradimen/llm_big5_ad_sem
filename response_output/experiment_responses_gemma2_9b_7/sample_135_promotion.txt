Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly appealing to me (1 for attractive), I find it interesting (3) and believe it's a decent advertisement (2).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best does appeal to me, so I would consider trying the product (1 for intend, 1 for try). However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it without further research or perhaps seeing a review from someone I trust. I might consider buying it if it was on sale or recommended by someone. 


My personality as described likely plays a role in this response. My reserved nature and tendency to be cautious would make me less likely to jump at an advertisement, even if it seems appealing.  I prefer to gather more information before making a decision.
