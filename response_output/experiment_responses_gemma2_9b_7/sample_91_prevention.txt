**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would likely consider buying it if others recommended it or if I was experiencing tiredness.
