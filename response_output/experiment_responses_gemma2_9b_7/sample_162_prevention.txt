**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me (I worry a lot and am sometimes nervous), I don't find it particularly *likeable*. It feels somewhat generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. However,  I think it's an interesting concept and a decent advertisement overall.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product.  The fear of appearing tired and dull is something that worries me, so I might give it a shot to see if it helps. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away, but I'm open to trying it based on this ad alone.
