Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It doesn't grab my attention strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention:** I do intend to purchase this product and will likely try it. However, I won't necessarily make a definite decision to buy it right away. The ad makes me curious enough to consider it. 


As a civil servant focused on doing thorough work, I might be drawn to the idea of increased energy helping me perform better in my job.  However, I'm cautious about advertising claims and wouldn't blindly purchase based on this alone.
