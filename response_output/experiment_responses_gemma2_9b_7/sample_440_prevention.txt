**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it clearly presents a potential consequence (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on creating anxiety ("Without this drink...").  I'm generally reserved and cautious, so while I might consider trying the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.
