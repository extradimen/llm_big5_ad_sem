**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a particularly exciting ad, but it gets the message across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is something that appeals to me.
    * **Good (2):**  It's clear and concise, but I don't find it particularly memorable or creative.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad design doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink if I was feeling run down and needed a quick boost.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I wouldn't actively seek it out, but I might give it a shot if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would at least think about buying it, especially if there were promotions or positive reviews. 


My personality traits influence these scores. My nervousness and tendency to worry could make me more susceptible to promises of feeling "energized." However, my distrustfulness and reserved nature mean I wouldn't be easily swayed by marketing claims alone. I need more information and probably some encouragement from others before making a purchase.
