**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at appealing to a target audience, I don't personally find it very *likeable* or *attractive*.  The claims are generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to a certain desire for self-improvement that I have, especially given my managerial role. However, I would only *try* it once before deciding if it's genuinely worth buying regularly.  I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it outright without more information or specific details about the drink's ingredients and benefits.
