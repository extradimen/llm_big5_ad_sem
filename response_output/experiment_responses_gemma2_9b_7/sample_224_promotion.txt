**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly exciting or captivating, but it's not outright disliked.
    * **Interesting (2):**  The message is straightforward and relatable, but not particularly novel or thought-provoking.
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively conveys the basic benefit of the drink - energy and appearance enhancement. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design or imagery doesn't hold much appeal.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it based on the claim, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd likely be open to trying it if offered or if it was conveniently available. 
    * **Consider (4):** I would seriously weigh the pros and cons before making a purchase decision. Factors like price, brand reputation, and availability of alternatives would influence my choice.



My reserved nature and tendency to trust make me more receptive to straightforward claims, but I wouldn't be swayed by flashy advertising alone. The ad piques mild interest, but it needs more convincing factors to lead to an actual purchase.
