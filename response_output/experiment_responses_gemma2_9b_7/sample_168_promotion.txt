**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  While not immediately grabbing my attention, the ad is straightforward and gets its message across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of "looking your best" piques my curiosity, especially as someone who worries a lot about appearance. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent attempt at an advertisement, but lacks something to truly make it memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad is visually simple and doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me *somewhat* interested in trying the product. 
    * **Try (1):** I wouldn't rush out to buy it, but if I saw it at a store or was offered a sample, I might give it a go.
    * **Consider (3):**  My level of consideration would depend heavily on factors like price, reviews, and whether the product aligns with my other health and wellness choices. 


**Key Factors Influencing My Response:**

* **Personality Traits:** My tendency to worry ("I worry a lot") could make me more susceptible to ads promising solutions for self-improvement (like "looking your best").
* **Financial Situation:** While I have a decent income, I'm a student and prioritize spending on education and necessities. A new drink wouldn't be an immediate priority.
