**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common and don't resonate deeply with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad piques my curiosity slightly, I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't actively plan to buy it unless I saw more convincing evidence of its effectiveness or had a specific need for an energy boost. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
