**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't believe it's necessarily "good." The claims are a bit generic and don't stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I like the idea of being energized and looking my best, so I would definitely intend to purchase this product and try it. However,  I wouldn't automatically commit without further research or seeing more specific details about the drink's ingredients and benefits.
