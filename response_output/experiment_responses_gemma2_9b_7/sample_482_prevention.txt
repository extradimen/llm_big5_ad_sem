**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt to grab attention, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would *intend* to try the product and might even *try* buying it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a regular purchase unless there were more compelling reasons or positive reviews. My distrustful nature makes me wary of claims like "Without this drink..."
