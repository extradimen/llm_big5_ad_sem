**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses straightforward language and taps into common desires for energy and appearance, I find it a bit simplistic. The "dull" imagery feels a bit weak to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm intrigued enough by the promise of increased energy that I might try this drink.  However, I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it based on this ad alone. I'd likely need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase.
