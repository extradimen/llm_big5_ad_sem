**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention. The claims about energy and appearance are common, so it doesn't feel unique or groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm definitely considering trying this drink.  I like the idea of staying energized, especially with my job as a civil servant. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd likely need to see more information about the ingredients and perhaps try a sample before committing to a purchase. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
