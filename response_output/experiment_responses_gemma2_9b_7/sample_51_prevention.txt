  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message relies on fear (feeling tired and dull), which isn't something that strongly motivates me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it right away. I'd probably need more information about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
