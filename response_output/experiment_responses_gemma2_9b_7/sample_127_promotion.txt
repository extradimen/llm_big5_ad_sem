**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing. It's not groundbreaking but it targets a desire to feel energized and look good, which is something most people can relate to.  However, it's not particularly unique or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the ad, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy the product. I'm more likely to "try" it if I see it available and affordable. It depends on other factors like reviews, branding, and specific ingredients.
