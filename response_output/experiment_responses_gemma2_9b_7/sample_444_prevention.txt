**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because the ad plays on my worry about looking dull (high score on "worry a lot"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright and would probably consider other options first.
