**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity and directness, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. My reserved nature makes me less drawn to overtly persuasive advertising. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, especially if it aligns with my desire for a boost in energy (though I wouldn't say I *intend* to purchase it). I would consider buying it further depending on word-of-mouth recommendations or positive reviews that resonate with my concerns about feeling tired.
