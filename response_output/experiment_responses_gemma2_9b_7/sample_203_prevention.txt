Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good,  I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it's particularly attractive. The language is a bit blunt ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my aspirations.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on anxieties about appearing tired and dull,  I am inclined to try the product. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away, but I might consider it if I were feeling particularly self-conscious or saw it advertised prominently.
