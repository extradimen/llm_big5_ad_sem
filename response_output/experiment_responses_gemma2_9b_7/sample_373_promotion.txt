Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets the point across, it's not particularly memorable or exciting. I find it interesting enough to glance at but wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. Since I am a student, these are definitely things I value. I'd likely try the product based on the ad, but wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing it without more information (like ingredients, reviews, etc.).
