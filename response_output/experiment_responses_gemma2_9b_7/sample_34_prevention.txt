**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive (both 1).  The "dull" implication feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with me.  I think it's a decent ad overall (3) in terms of getting the message across.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be inclined to try this product (1) based on the appeal to avoiding negative outcomes ("tired," "dull"). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1).  I would likely consider buying it (2) if I was facing a situation where I felt tired and wanted a quick energy boost.
