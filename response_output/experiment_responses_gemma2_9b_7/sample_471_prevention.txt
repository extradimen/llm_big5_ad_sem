**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in terms of trying to make a point, I don't personally like it. The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull").  I also wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my skepticism about the ad's claims and tendency to be distrusting, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase this product or even try it. However, if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious, I might consider buying it out of desperation. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
