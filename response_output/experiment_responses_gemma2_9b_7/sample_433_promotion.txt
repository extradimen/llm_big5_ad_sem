**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I don't personally find it *that* attractive. It uses common marketing tactics that aren't particularly original. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "looking your best" is appealing to me, but the "stay energized" part isn't as important. Since I'm focused on my studies and have a relatively busy schedule, something that helps with focus and energy would be more useful than simply looking good. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
