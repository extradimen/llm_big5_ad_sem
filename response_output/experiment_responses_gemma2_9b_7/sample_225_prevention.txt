**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * I **like the ad (3):** It's simple and gets a point across. While not exciting, it uses relatable feelings of tiredness and dullness.
    * I **think the ad is interesting (2):**  It piques my curiosity enough to make me think about the product.
    * I **believe the ad is good (2):** It's effective in its simplicity, but I wouldn't call it particularly well-made.
    * I **find the ad attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * I **intend to purchase this product (1):**  I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it. The ad raises awareness but doesn't create a strong desire.
    * I **will try to buy this product (1):**  Similar to above, I might consider it if I was already looking for a drink like this. 
    * I **will consider buying this product (3):** If I was experiencing fatigue or noticed the drink in a store, I'd be more likely to give it a try.
