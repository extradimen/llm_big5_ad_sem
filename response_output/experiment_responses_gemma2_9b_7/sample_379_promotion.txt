**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me aesthetically. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with my personal values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the idea of staying energized is appealing, especially given my job as a civil servant. I'm also willing to *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it over other things I need.
