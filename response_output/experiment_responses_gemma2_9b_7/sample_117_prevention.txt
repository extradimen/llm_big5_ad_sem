**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit oversimplified and relies on fear tactics.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without more information about its benefits and ingredients. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
