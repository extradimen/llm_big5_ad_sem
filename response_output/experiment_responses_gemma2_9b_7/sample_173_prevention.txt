**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on common fears of looking dull and tired, which could resonate with someone concerned about their appearance.
    * **Good (2):** While simple, the message is clear and gets the point across. 
    * **Like (2):** It's not particularly memorable or exciting, but it does pique my curiosity. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal and relies on a somewhat generic fear tactic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying the product based on the ad alone.  
    * **Try (1):** If I saw this drink in a store, I might be tempted to give it a go due to the promise of avoiding tiredness and dullness. 
    * **Consider (3):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and availability. The ad alone wouldn't be enough to convince me to make a purchase.




As someone who is generally trusting but also careless, I might be swayed by the ad's simplicity and direct appeal to avoiding negative consequences. However,  my tendency to be nervous and worry could lead me to research more about the product before committing to a purchase.
