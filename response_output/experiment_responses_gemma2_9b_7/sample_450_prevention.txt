**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a clear message, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't be immediately driven to purchase it (intend) or even try it (try) based solely on this advertisement. I would need more information about the product and its benefits.
