**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it taps into a common worry about looking tired, I don't personally find it *likeable* or *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative and alarmist.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me *intend to purchase* and *try* the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider buying* it regularly without more information about its effectiveness and ingredients. My worry tendency might lead me to seek a solution, but I'm not easily swayed by advertising alone.
