**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less likely to consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am intrigued enough by the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials.  I'd definitely consider buying it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews.
