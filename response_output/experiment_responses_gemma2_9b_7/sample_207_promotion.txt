**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be decent and potentially interesting, I wouldn't call it fantastic. It's a fairly standard "look good, feel good" approach.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values being original and coming up with new ideas (which this ad doesn't appeal to), I'd likely be more drawn to products that offer something unique. However, the promise of energy and looking my best is appealing enough for me to consider trying it out.
