**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than positive selling points. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it. Considering buying it depends heavily on other factors like price, availability, and personal needs at the time. I tend to be cautious and worry a lot, so I wouldn't jump into purchasing something based solely on an ad.
