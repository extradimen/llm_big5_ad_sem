**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel generic and don't resonate with my personality.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider trying this product. My tendency to worry a lot could lead me to search for solutions that promise increased energy and confidence. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or actively seek it out.
