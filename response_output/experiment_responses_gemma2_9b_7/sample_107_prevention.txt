**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, it doesn't particularly attract me. The message relies on fear (feeling tired and looking dull) which isn't always effective for me.  I tend to be more motivated by logic and reason than emotional appeals.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd likely want to research more about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision. I value doing a thorough job (as per my personality traits), so a hasty purchase isn't in line with that. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
