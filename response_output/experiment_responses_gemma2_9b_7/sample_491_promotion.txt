**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and uses common phrasing to appeal to a broad audience. I find it mildly appealing.
    * **Interesting (2):** While the message isn't particularly unique, it does pique my curiosity enough to want to learn more about the product. 
    * **Good (4):**  The ad effectively communicates its core message: energy and appearance benefits. It's clear and concise.
    * **Attractive (2):** The simplicity of the ad isn't particularly eye-catching, but it's not off-putting either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm inclined to try this product based on the ad alone, as I value feeling energized and looking my best.
    * **Try (2):**  I'd definitely consider purchasing a smaller size or sample pack first to test it out before committing to a larger purchase.
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on factors like price, reviews, and availability, I would seriously weigh the pros and cons of buying this product.
