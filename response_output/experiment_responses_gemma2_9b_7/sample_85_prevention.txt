**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad.** (1): The ad's message is a bit blunt and lacks subtlety, which doesn't appeal to my reserved nature. 
    * **I think the ad is interesting.** (2):  The claim of feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat intriguing, though I find it exaggerated.
    * **I believe the ad is good.** (1): As a civil servant who values honesty and thoroughness, the ad's approach feels manipulative. It preys on insecurities rather than offering genuine value. 
    * **I find the ad attractive.** (2): The simplicity of the message and the direct appeal to negative emotions make it somewhat memorable, but not in a positive way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product.** (1):  The ad doesn't convince me of the product's necessity. My personality leans towards skepticism and careful consideration before making purchases.
    * **I will try to buy this product.** (1): I might be tempted to try it out of curiosity, but only if it's heavily discounted or recommended by someone trustworthy. 
    * **I will consider buying this product.** (3):  If the product were highly recommended by a trusted source and presented with more nuanced messaging, I might seriously consider it. However, based on this ad alone, I'm unlikely to purchase it.
