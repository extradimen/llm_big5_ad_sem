  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 4]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it. It's a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.  I wouldn't call it attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would consider trying the product. However, as someone who generally trusts their own instincts and isn't easily swayed by advertising, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it outright or even actively seek it out. The "look your best" part feels a bit superficial for me,  but the "energized" aspect might appeal if I'm feeling particularly drained one day.
