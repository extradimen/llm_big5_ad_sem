```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promoting the product, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The claims feel generic and don't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product (score 3). It's possible I would even go as far as purchasing it if I saw it in store (score 2), but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (score 1).


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
