**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it taps into a common concern about looking tired and dull.  I believe it's *good* in its simplicity, but not particularly *attractive*. It doesn't stand out as visually appealing or unique.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't *intend* to buy this product immediately. However, I would *try* it if given the opportunity (perhaps a sample). I could be persuaded to *consider* buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients.
