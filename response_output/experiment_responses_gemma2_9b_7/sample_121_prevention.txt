**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something I particularly like or find attractive. The message relies on fear ("look dull") which isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product because it plays on a worry I have (looking tired). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively try to buy it. More information about the product's ingredients and benefits would be needed before I made a decision.
