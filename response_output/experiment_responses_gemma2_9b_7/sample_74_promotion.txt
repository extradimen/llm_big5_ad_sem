**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't personally find it very attractive. The claims about looking your best and staying energized are common in ads for this type of product and don't particularly stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad doesn't really grab my attention, I'm unlikely to actively seek this product out (intend or try). However, if I were at a store and saw it, I might consider buying it based on the basic promise of energy and appearance improvement. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
