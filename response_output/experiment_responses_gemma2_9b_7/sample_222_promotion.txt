**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The claims seem generic and not very unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and try it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a conscious decision to buy it without further research or seeing reviews.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
