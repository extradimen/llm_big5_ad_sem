**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it attractive or particularly like it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. While I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it, I would be open to trying it based on the promise of feeling energized and looking good.  I am more likely to consider buying it if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people whose opinions I trust.
