**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to my desire for energy and looking good,  it doesn't feel particularly groundbreaking or unique. It relies on common marketing phrases. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Although I might try the product out of curiosity due to its promise of energy and enhanced appearance, I wouldn't necessarily make a conscious decision to purchase it regularly. There are probably other drinks I already like or am more familiar with.
