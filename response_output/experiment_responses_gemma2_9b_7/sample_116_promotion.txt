**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad message fairly interesting. It plays on common desires for energy and looking good. However, it's not particularly compelling or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad does pique my curiosity enough to read it. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets its point across clearly, but it lacks anything truly unique or impressive.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually or conceptually appealing. It feels generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider trying this drink, especially if it was heavily discounted or offered as a sample. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd be willing to give it a shot once, but I wouldn't make a habit of buying it based solely on this ad.
    * **Consider (3):**  If I saw the drink regularly and heard positive reviews from people I trust, I might be more likely to purchase it. 



As someone who worries a lot and values doing a thorough job, I would likely want to research this product more before buying it.  I'd want to know about its ingredients, potential side effects, and whether there was any scientific evidence to support the claims made in the ad.
