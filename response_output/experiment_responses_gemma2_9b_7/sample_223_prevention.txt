**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's necessarily "good" advertising. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which can be manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because the ad plays on my tendency to worry (I worry a lot).  The promise of avoiding tiredness and dullness appeals to me, even though I might find the ad's tactics a bit questionable.
