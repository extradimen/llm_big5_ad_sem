**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a simple message that gets attention. I wouldn't say I *love* it, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's fairly straightforward and doesn't really pique my curiosity. 
    * **Good (4):**  I think it effectively conveys the potential negative consequences of *not* using the product.  
    * **Attractive (3):** The language is appealing in a basic way, but it lacks any real creativity or uniqueness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  The ad makes me think about trying the product. I'm not entirely convinced, but the "tired and dull" aspect resonates with me sometimes.
    * **Try (1):**   I'm more likely to give it a try than buy it immediately based on this ad alone. 
    * **Consider (3):**  If I saw this ad repeatedly or there was more information about the product, my consideration would increase.
