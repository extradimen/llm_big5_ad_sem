Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative using fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired...") rather than highlighting positive aspects.  I also don't find it very attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad might make me *consider* buying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or even try it right away. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and personal preference for the brand.
