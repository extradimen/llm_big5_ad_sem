**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing to my desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle. While not groundbreaking or particularly creative, it speaks to my values.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product based on the advertisement. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it without further research into its ingredients and potential effects. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
