Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive. The promise of looking your best is appealing, but it's a pretty generic claim. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  While I like the idea and would probably try the drink, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. My "consider" score reflects that I'd need to see more about the product before making a firm commitment.
