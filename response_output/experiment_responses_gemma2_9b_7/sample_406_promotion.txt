**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly interesting and decent in its construction, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. However, without more specific information about the ingredients, health benefits, or taste, I wouldn't be inclined to buy it right away. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
