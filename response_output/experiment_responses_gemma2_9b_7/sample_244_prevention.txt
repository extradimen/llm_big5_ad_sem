**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3) because it uses a simple and common fear tactic (looking dull). 
    * While it's not particularly creative or well-made, it gets my attention.
    * I don't find it particularly good (2), attractive (1), or something I necessarily like (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1) because the ad alone isn't strong enough to convince me.  
    * I will try to buy this product (1) if I happen to see it and am in the mood for a drink.
    * I will consider buying this product (2) if there are other factors influencing my decision, like reviews or recommendations from friends.



As someone who is generally emotionally stable and focused on doing a thorough job, I'm not easily swayed by advertising that relies on fear tactics. The ad might pique my curiosity, but it lacks the substance to convince me to make a purchase based solely on its claims.
