**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it uses a relatable fear of tiredness and dullness), I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities. The "attractive" score is low because it lacks creativity or anything that truly grabs my attention visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product out of curiosity. Because I worry a lot, the promise of feeling less tired might appeal to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly without more convincing evidence about its effectiveness.
