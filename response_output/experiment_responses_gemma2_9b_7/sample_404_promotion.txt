**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel *attractive*. The claims are common and don't stand out.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry and the fact that I am somewhat distrusting, I would probably *try* this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I would likely consider buying it after trying it or seeing more information about its ingredients and effects.
