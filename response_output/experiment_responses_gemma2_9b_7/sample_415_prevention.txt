**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I would consider trying this product (3) as  I'm always looking for ways to feel more energetic. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or actively seek it out (1) without further research and potentially a recommendation from someone I trust.
