**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. My decision would likely depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal preference.
