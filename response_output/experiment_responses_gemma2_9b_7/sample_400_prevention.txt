**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it appeals to a desire for well-being, I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit dramatic and doesn't resonate with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would likely consider it further depending on other factors like price and availability. 


My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me more susceptible to the "look dull" part of the ad, even if I don't agree with the implied cause-and-effect relationship.
