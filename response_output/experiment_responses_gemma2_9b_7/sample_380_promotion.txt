**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or trying a sample first.  I might consider buying it depending on price, reviews, and if I feel I truly need an extra boost. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
