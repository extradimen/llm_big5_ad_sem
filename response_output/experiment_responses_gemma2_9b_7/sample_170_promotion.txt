  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, I find it moderately appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that resonates with me, even if it's a common marketing message.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value being original and coming up with new ideas, I'm more likely to try products that are unique or innovative. This ad doesn't really convey anything special about the drink itself. I might try it once out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly unless there was something more distinctive about it.  



I tend to be careful and thorough in my decision-making, so I need more information before committing to a purchase.
