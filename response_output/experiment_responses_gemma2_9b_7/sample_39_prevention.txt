**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it's playing on common fears), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on vague claims.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright.  My consideration would depend on other factors like price, availability, and reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
