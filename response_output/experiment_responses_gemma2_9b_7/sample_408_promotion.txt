**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that aligns with my desire to maintain a certain image and be successful in my work. However, I don't think it's exceptionally creative or groundbreaking. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the ad, I'm not immediately sold on the product. I'd likely try it once based on the ad's promise, but I wouldn't make a regular purchase commitment until I saw more concrete evidence of its effectiveness and perhaps tried it myself. My personality leans towards being cautious and needing to see tangible results before committing.
