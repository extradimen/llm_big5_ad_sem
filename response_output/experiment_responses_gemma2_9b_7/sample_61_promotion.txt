**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims about energy and looking your best are common in these types of ads and don't particularly resonate with me.  However, because it's a relatively low-cost product and the ad piques my curiosity, I might try it.
