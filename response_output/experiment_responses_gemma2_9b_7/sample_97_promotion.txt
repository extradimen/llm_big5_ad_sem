**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive and interesting. It's not particularly groundbreaking but it hits on some things that appeal to me â€“ staying energized and looking my best.  While I think it's a decent ad, I wouldn't call it "good" in the sense of being particularly creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I agree with the ad's message and find it appealing, I would likely purchase this product. I'm open to trying new things that might help me feel more energized and look good. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately.  I'd probably try it if it was offered or on sale first. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to analyze!
