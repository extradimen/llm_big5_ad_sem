**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't personally find it very attractive or particularly like it. The framing of feeling tired and looking dull is a bit manipulative, which makes me less receptive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my curiosity, I am unlikely to immediately purchase this product. I might try it out if I see it on sale or in a convenient location. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
