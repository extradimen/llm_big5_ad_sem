**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **I like the ad (2):** While I find it intriguing, it's not something I particularly enjoy.
    * **I think the ad is interesting (3):**  The "tired and dull" message plays on common insecurities, which catches my attention. 
    * **I believe the ad is good (2):** It's effective in its simplicity, but lacks depth or originality.
    * **I find the ad attractive (1):**  The language feels a bit too forceful and manipulative for my taste.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **I intend to purchase this product (1):**  Not immediately. I'm cautious about new products, especially those making strong claims.
    * **I will try to buy this product (1):** Perhaps if it were recommended by someone I trust or offered at a good price.
    * **I will consider buying this product (3):**  The ad has sparked my curiosity, so I might research it further and potentially give it a try depending on reviews and other factors. 


As someone who is reserved, tends to worry, and gets nervous easily, I'm more likely to be skeptical of ads that use fear tactics or make bold claims. This particular ad does both, which makes me less receptive.
