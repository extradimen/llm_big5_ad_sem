  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and relatable (who doesn't want to avoid feeling tired and looking dull?), it relies on fear-based tactics.  I find it somewhat manipulative ("Without this drink..."). The "dull" imagery is also a bit vague and subjective, which lowers my opinion of its attractiveness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I do intend to *try* the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. If it were positioned more as a solution for achieving energy and vibrancy rather than solely focusing on avoiding negativity, I'd be more inclined to purchase it outright.  However, I'm cautious about blindly trusting claims like this, so I'd likely consider alternatives before committing fully.
