**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. My reserved nature and lack of interest in typical marketing ploys contribute to this.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'd likely give the product a try based on the ad's claims, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate strongly with me, and my carelessness might lead to forgetting to use it consistently. However, I wouldn't rule out considering it further if I saw positive reviews or noticed its benefits in real life.
