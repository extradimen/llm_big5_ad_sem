**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, it's not particularly exciting or memorable for me. I find the promise of staying energized and looking good appealing, but the ad itself doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this drink because the claims resonate with me on a basic level. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. My "consider" score reflects that I'd likely need more information about the product (ingredients, taste, etc.) before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
