**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used makes me feel a bit uneasy, as if it's playing on my insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product because of the fear-based messaging ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or make it a regular purchase.  I'd probably need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing. 



The ad preys on my anxieties (feeling tired and looking dull) which are heightened by my tendency to worry and nervousness.
