**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's highly attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with my desire to present myself well professionally (given my managerial role). However, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to try it immediately.  I'd probably consider buying it after seeing more information or reviews about it. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
