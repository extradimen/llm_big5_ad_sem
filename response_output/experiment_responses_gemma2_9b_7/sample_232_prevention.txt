**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I understand the ad's message, it relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't resonate with me. I find it slightly interesting because it plays on common insecurities, but overall I don't like it or find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the fear-based approach, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance, I might be more inclined to try it. Ultimately, I would consider buying it only if other factors, like personal recommendations or a compelling price point, came into play.
