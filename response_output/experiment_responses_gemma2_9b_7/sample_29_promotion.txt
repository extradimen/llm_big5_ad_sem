Here's a brief explanation of my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it promises benefits that appeal to someone who wants to look and feel their best. However, I wouldn't call it *attractive* or *good*.  It seems a bit generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of energy and looking good aligns with my desire to maintain a certain image.  
    * I would also *try* it, as a higher income allows for experimentation with new products. 
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it based solely on this ad. I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a firm decision.
