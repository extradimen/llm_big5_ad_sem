**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and I think it's a decent attempt to grab attention, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It relies on a somewhat fear-based tactic which isn't my favorite. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately. I would probably consider it further depending on other factors like price and reviews. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
