**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive because it speaks to my desire to look and feel my best, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly interesting.  It's a standard type of advertisement that relies on common desires. However, I do think it's a decent attempt at promoting the product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I'm intrigued by the ad and might consider trying the drink, I wouldn't immediately purchase it.  I need to see more information about its ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.   




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
