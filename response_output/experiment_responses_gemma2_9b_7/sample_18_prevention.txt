**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative, which is why my score for "like" and "attractive" is low.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product because of the claim that it helps with feeling tired and looking dull. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away but would be curious enough to give it a shot, especially if there was a good deal or promotion. However, I wouldn't actively consider buying it without further research or seeing positive reviews from people like me. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
