**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across. I find it mildly interesting.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and dull is something relatable, though it doesn't grab my attention strongly.
    * **Good (2):** It's clear and concise in its message, but not particularly creative or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad itself is attractive. The language is a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this if I was already experiencing fatigue and looking for a solution. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd probably give it a try based on the ad alone, especially if it was available somewhere convenient.
    * **Consider (2):**  There's a good chance I'd at least think about purchasing it if I needed an energy boost.



The ad plays on common anxieties about looking and feeling tired, which might appeal to some people. However, as someone who is generally reserved and doesn't easily get nervous, this type of fear-based advertising isn't particularly persuasive to me.
