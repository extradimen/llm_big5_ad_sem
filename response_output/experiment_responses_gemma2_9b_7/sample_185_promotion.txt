  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it promises a positive outcome (staying energized and looking good). The simplicity of the message makes it easy to understand.  However, I don't find it particularly creative or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I prioritize being healthy and taking care of myself, and the ad appeals to those desires, I would definitely consider trying this drink. It aligns with my values of looking my best and feeling energized for work.
