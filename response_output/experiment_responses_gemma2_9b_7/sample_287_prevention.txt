**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire for a vibrant appearance, I don't consider it particularly good. The "you may feel tired and look dull" approach feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because it promises a solution to feeling tired and looking dull, which aligns with my desire for personal improvement. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first, and I would definitely consider other factors like price and reviews before making a final decision.
