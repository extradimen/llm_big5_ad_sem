  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't necessarily *bad*, it relies on fear tactics and generalizing about how people feel. I find it a bit manipulative, but also somewhat interesting in its straightforward approach.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it without more information about its taste, ingredients, and effectiveness. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
