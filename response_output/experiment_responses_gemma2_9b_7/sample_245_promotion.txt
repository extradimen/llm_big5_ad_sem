**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and lack specific details that would make me more interested. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product due to the promise of staying energized and looking my best. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively try to buy it without further research and perhaps seeing testimonials from others. My reserved nature makes me cautious about trying new products without more information.
