``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. The claim of looking "your best" feels shallow and a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because I'm trying to be original, and I do sometimes like to try new things, I might *intend* to purchase this product or at least *try* it. However, I would probably only *consider* buying it if there were other factors influencing my decision (like a sale or recommendation from someone I trust).  


My personality traits influence how I perceive the ad. My tendency towards being reserved and distrustful makes me less likely to be swayed by marketing claims that feel generic or exaggerated. Additionally, my nervousness and emotional instability might make me more hesitant about making impulsive purchases like this.
