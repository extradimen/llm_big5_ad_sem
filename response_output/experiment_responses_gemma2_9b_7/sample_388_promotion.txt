**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are universal aspirations. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive (1)*.  It seems like a fairly standard advertisement. 
    * It's **good (2)** in that it conveys its message clearly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase (1)** this product because the ad piques my interest and I'm always looking for ways to improve my energy levels. However,  I would likely **try (1)** it first before committing to a full purchase. 
    *  I **will consider (2)** buying it depending on reviews, price, and if I find it actually delivers on its promises. My reserved nature means I'm cautious about trying new things.
