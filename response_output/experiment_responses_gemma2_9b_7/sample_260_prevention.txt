**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull"  feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me think about trying this product because I worry a lot and want to avoid feeling tired. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects.
