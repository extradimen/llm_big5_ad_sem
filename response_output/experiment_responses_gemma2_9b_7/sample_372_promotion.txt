Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it presents a decent message, I don't personally connect with it.  The claims about looking your best every day aren't particularly appealing to me at this stage in life. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. It would need more than just a general "energy and appearance" promise to convince me.  




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
