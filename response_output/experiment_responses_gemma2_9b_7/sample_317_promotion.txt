I find the ad decent and interesting. It appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common aspirations. However, the claim of "looking your best every day" is vague and relies on subjective interpretation. I would be more inclined to buy if there was more specific information about ingredients or benefits backed by evidence.
