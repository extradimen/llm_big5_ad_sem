```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is presented in a straightforward way that I find somewhat interesting (score 3), it lacks creativity or anything particularly captivating.  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it attractive (scores 2, 1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of looking your best every day appeals to me, but the lack of specifics about how the drink achieves this makes me hesitant. I would likely try it once (score 1) and might consider buying it again if I found a noticeable effect (score 3).  I wouldn't commit to purchasing it outright without more information.
