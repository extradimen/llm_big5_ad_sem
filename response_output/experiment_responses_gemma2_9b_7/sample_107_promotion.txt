**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't quite grab my attention strongly (hence not a "strongly agree" on any).  The language is familiar and common in many ads, so it's not particularly unique or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product. My personality leans towards being careful and thorough (not careless), which might make me want to test out the claims before fully committing. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
