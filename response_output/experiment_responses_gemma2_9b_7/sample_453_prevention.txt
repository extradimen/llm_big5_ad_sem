**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and good. It's not particularly attractive or something I'd actively seek out, but it gets my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards purchasing this product. The ad plays on a common concern (feeling tired and dull) which resonates with me, especially given my office job. While I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it, the ad has increased my likelihood of trying it. 



**Reasoning:**

As someone who values being emotionally stable and generally trusting, I'm more susceptible to appeals that focus on well-being and avoiding negative outcomes (feeling tired and dull). The "prevention" angle of the ad works for me because it highlights a potential problem I might be facing. However, my reserved nature means I wouldn't be overly enthusiastic about the product or consider it essential.
