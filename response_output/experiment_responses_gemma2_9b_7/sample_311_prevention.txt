**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly excite me or grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on potential insecurities ("tired," "dull") which could influence me to try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I'd likely consider buying it after further research or if I see positive reviews.
