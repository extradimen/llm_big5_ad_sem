 **Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it offers a simple benefit (energy and good looks). While not groundbreaking, it's something many people seek. However, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." It lacks specifics about the ingredients or unique selling points.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product because I believe in taking care of my appearance and staying energetic. Since my income is relatively low, I would prioritize trying a smaller size first before committing to a full purchase.
