Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative, so it's not something I find attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention:** Because the ad plays on insecurities (feeling tired and dull), I might be tempted to try the product out of curiosity or a desire to avoid those feelings. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly unless there were more compelling reasons or testimonials. I would consider buying it if it was affordable and readily available. 


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be original and distrustful, make me less susceptible to traditional advertising appeals that rely on fear or insecurity.
