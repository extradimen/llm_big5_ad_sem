**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive because it promises something everyone wants: energy and looking good. While I don't think it's a *great* ad, it gets my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product as I like the idea of feeling energized and looking better. However, I would probably try it first before committing to buying it regularly. I'm not completely sold on the claims, so I need to see if it actually works for me. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
