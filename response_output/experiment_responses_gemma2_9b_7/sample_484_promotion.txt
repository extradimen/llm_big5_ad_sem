**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting, it doesn't completely wow me. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing phrases.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product. The promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me. However,  I'd probably try it first before committing to regular purchases.
