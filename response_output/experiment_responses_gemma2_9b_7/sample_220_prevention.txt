**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at getting attention, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The language used feels a bit over-the-top and  makes broad generalizations about how people feel. I also don't particularly *like* it because it relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting any genuine benefits of the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend to purchase* this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt like my appearance was lacking. It piques my curiosity enough that I'd  *try* it once. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without more concrete information about its ingredients and effects. 


As someone who values thoroughness and doing a good job, I would want to research the product further before making a decision. The ad alone doesn't provide enough convincing information for me to commit to a purchase.
