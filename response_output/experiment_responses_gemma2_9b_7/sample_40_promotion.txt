**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't personally find it *attractive* (1).  The message is straightforward and  doesn't particularly appeal to my reserved nature. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm not immediately convinced to buy the product (1), but I might *try* it (1) if I saw it available and felt curious. I would definitely *consider* buying it (3) if there were testimonials or reviews from people I trust.  My personality traits suggest I'd need more than just a simple ad to feel confident in a purchase.
