Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly *like* it or find it exceptionally attractive. The language feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to give this product a try because I generally trust ads that promise energy boosts (though I'd probably be cautious about the "look your best" part). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first.
