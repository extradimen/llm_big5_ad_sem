Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking), moderately interesting (score 5), and generally good (score 4). However, the attractiveness is only mild (score 3) as it doesn't strongly resonate with my artistic interests.
- Purchase intention: While the ad does not make me strongly intend to purchase (score 2), I might consider buying if there are other factors such as price and availability (score 1 for trying). The consideration score is set at 3, indicating that while it doesn't immediately attract me to buy, it could be a possibility in certain circumstances.
