Explanation:
- The ad is relatively appealing to me as a young student who values being outgoing and sociable. It suggests that the drink can help in staying energized for daily activities, which aligns with my need for energy throughout the day. However, I am somewhat skeptical about claims of looking one's best just by consuming this product, hence the lower score on attractiveness (4).
- My attitude towards the ad is generally positive; I find it interesting and good to some extent due to its potential relevance to my lifestyle (6 for interesting, 5 for good). However, I am not entirely convinced of all its claims.
- Regarding purchase intention, while I might consider buying this product if there's a compelling offer or recommendation from trusted sources (2), it is not at the top of my list due to my skepticism and lack of thoroughness in making decisions (1 for intend). Moreover, since I am currently focused on education, other priorities may take precedence over purchasing such products.
