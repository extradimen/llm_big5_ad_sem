Explanation of the scores:
- The ad is moderately attractive (score 5) as it claims to provide energy and improve appearance, which could be appealing to many. However, being a blue-collar worker with few artistic interests and not particularly focused on new ideas or imagination, the appeal may not be very high for me personally. Hence, I rate "I like the ad" at 4, finding it somewhat likable but not strongly so; "interesting" at 3 as it's not particularly engaging given my personality traits; and "good" at 2 because while it makes claims that could appeal to a broad audience, it doesn't resonate deeply with me.
- In terms of purchase intention, I am leaning towards the lower end of the scale. The ad does not strongly convince me to buy the product immediately (score 1 for "intend"), but if the opportunity arises or there is a need in the future, I might try it out (score 2 for "try"). However, given my personality and occupation, I would consider buying the product based on its functional benefits rather than any emotional appeal of the ad (score 3 for "consider").
