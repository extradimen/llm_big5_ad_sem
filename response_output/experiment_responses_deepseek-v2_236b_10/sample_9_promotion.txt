Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it appeals to a desire for energy and looking one's best, which could be appealing regardless of demographic. The claim that the drink helps with staying energized is interesting (score 5), but I am skeptical about its ability to make me look my best every day (hence score 3 for "good"). As someone who is reserved and not particularly talkative or outgoing, I don't strongly like the ad (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Given that I tend to be cautious and thorough in my decisions, coupled with a low level of trust in general claims made by advertisements, my intention to purchase this product is very low (score 1). However, if there was significant social proof or endorsement from credible sources, I might consider trying the product (score 2), which would lead me to further research before making a decision (score 3 for "consider").
