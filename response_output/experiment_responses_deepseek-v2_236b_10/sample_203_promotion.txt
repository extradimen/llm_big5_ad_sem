Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to be appealing as it promises energy and looking one's best. It aligns with the personality trait of wanting to look good (attractive - score 6) and finding something interesting (score 4). However, there is a slight reservation about fully endorsing its goodness (good - score 5), possibly due to skepticism or personal preference for more artistic or original ads.
- **Purchase intention**: The ad does not strongly persuade the individual to immediately purchase the product (intend - score 2), but it could be considered (consider - score 5) if there is a need for an energy boost and looking one's best aligns with personal goals. It might also prompt a try, depending on other factors like reviews or price.

These scores reflect the nuanced response of someone who values helpfulness, emotional stability, and has an active imagination but may not be fully convinced by a straightforward promotional ad without additional creative appeal.
