Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I moderately like the ad (score 5) because it aligns with my outgoing and sociable personality. It seems interesting to me (score 6) as it promises energy and looking one's best, which could appeal to someone who is often out and about. However, while I find it somewhat good (score 5), its attractiveness is limited for me personally due to my neutral stance on artistic interests (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase the product is low because although I will consider buying this product (score 4) given that energy can be appealing, there's not a strong urge to do so immediately. The ad doesn't resonate enough with my values on thoroughness and planning (scores 2 and 3).
