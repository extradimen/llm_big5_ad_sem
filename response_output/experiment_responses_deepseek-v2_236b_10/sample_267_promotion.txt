Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I have a mixed but generally neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the ad. The claim that the drink helps stay energized and look one's best is somewhat appealing due to my outgoing nature (Strongly Agree on being talkative and sociable) and interest in new ideas (Agree on having an active imagination). However, as a person who values thoroughness and careful planning (Strongly Disagree on doing a thorough job and Strongly Agree on making plans), I am skeptical about the broad claims made without specific evidence or details.
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad is not strongly persuasive, it does pique my interest to some extent (score 2 on "try" for purchase intention). As someone who tends to worry a lot (Strongly Agree) and is emotionally stable (Disagree), I might consider looking into more information about the product before making a decision. However, given that my occupation as a student and living with parents may not align with the target demographic of this ad, my actual intention to purchase remains low.
