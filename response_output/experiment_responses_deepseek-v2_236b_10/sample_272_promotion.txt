Explanation:
- Attitude towards the advertisement: I find it somewhat interesting (score of 4) and potentially good (score of 5), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score of 2). My liking for the ad is neutral (score of 3).
- Purchase intention: The ad does not strongly motivate me to purchase the product immediately (score of 1), but it might be something I could try in the future (score of 2) and would consider buying if other factors, such as reviews or recommendations from friends, support its claims (score of 3).
