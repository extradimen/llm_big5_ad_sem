Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad to be somewhat attractive (score 3), which is not a strong appeal but it does catch my attention. It's interesting enough for me to pay more attention to it (score 5). I believe it's a good advertisement in terms of its message and presentation, as it aligns with my desire to stay energized and look my best (score 6), which is something I value due to my busy lifestyle as an office worker. However, the claim about looking one's best might be somewhat superficial, hence the moderate score for attractiveness.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad does pique my interest, my intention to purchase is not immediate (score 2). It would depend on further information or reviews before I make a decision to try it out. If those are positive, then I might consider purchasing the product (score 3), especially if it aligns with my need for energy and maintaining an appearance that reflects my professional status. However, without more convincing evidence of its effectiveness, my intention remains cautious.
