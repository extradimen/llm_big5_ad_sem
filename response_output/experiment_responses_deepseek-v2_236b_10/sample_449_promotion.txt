Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likable (score 4), quite interesting (score 5), somewhat good but not exceptional (score 3), and very attractive due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement (score 6). The ad appeals to my outgoing nature and desire to look my best, which aligns with my sociable personality.
- **Purchase intention**: While I am skeptical about the product's claims (reflected in my general distrustfulness), I would still intend to learn more about it (score 2) and consider buying it if further information convinces me of its benefits (score 3). However, I do not strongly plan to purchase it immediately due to my cautious nature.
