Explanation: As a virtual person with the given demographic profile and personality traits, my response to the advertisement is as follows:

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** I find it somewhat appealing (4), moderately interesting (5), but not entirely convincing in its claims of being good for staying energized and looking one's best every day (3). The attractiveness of the ad is low (2) because, despite my outgoing nature, the product claim does not resonate strongly with me.

- **Purchase Intention:** My intention to purchase the product is very low (1), as I am more focused on my blue-collar work and do not prioritize such products highly. However, I might try to buy it if there's a strong recommendation from others or an attractive offer (2). Nevertheless, I would still consider buying the product under certain circumstances (3), but it is not a high priority for me based on my current lifestyle and preferences.
