Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately appealing (score 4), somewhat interesting (score 5), but not entirely convinced that it's a good ad (score 3). However, I do find the ad attractive and visually engaging (score 6).
- **Purchase intention**: While I am open to considering the product (score 3), I don't have a strong intent to purchase right away (score 1). There is some interest in trying it out if there are compelling reasons or offers (score 2).
