Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): The advertisement is somewhat appealing due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which aligns with my value for being presentable as an office worker. However, it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): It captures attention by making a claim that many people might find appealingâ€”the idea of staying energized and looking good could be intriguing to a broad audience.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): While it's not particularly outstanding, it communicates its message clearly without being overly flashy or manipulative.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): The promise of energy and appearance enhancement is appealing to me as an office worker who values a professional image and needs to stay focused during work hours.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): While not strongly motivated, there's a possibility that if the need for extra energy arises or if it fits within my budget and health considerations, I might consider buying it.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): There isn't an immediate plan to seek out this product, but under certain circumstances, such as recommendation from someone trusted or a good promotion, it could be considered.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): The ad has planted the idea in my mind, and if further information supports its claims and aligns with my needs, there's potential for consideration. However, without additional persuasion, such as positive reviews or more detailed benefits, the intent to purchase remains neutral at best.
