Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a female office worker with a postgraduate degree in her mid-forties from China, I have a generally trusting nature and am inclined to find the ad somewhat appealing. However, my artistic interests are few, which means that while I might not be particularly drawn to creative or innovative advertising, I can still appreciate an ad that promises practical benefits like staying energized and looking one's best.
  - **I like the ad**: A score of 4 indicates a moderate level of liking for the advertisement. It doesn't strongly resonate with my personal preferences but is not off-putting either.
  - **I think the ad is interesting**: With a score of 5, I find it moderately interesting, likely because of its direct and practical appeal rather than any artistic or innovative content.
  - **I believe the ad is good**: A score of 5 suggests that while I don't have strong feelings about the quality of the ad, I acknowledge that it serves a clear purpose and communicates its message effectively.
  - **I find the ad attractive**: With a score of 3, my attraction to the advertisement is relatively low. This could be due to my lack of artistic interests or because the ad's appeal doesn't align strongly with my personal values.

- **Purchase intention**: Despite having a generally positive view of the advertisement, my purchase intentions are somewhat reserved, reflecting my personality traits and practical considerations as an office worker.
  - **I intend to purchase this product**: A score of 2 indicates that I do not have a strong intent to buy the product immediately but might if certain conditions or needs arise.
  - **I will try to buy this product**: With a score of 1, my intention is low; it's unlikely that I would actively seek out and purchase this product based on the ad alone.
  - **I will consider buying this product**: A score of 3 suggests that while I am open to considering the product, more information or a specific need would be required for me to move forward with a potential purchase.
