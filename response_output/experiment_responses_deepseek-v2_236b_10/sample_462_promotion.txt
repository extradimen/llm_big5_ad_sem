Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing; it's not overly exciting but does convey a positive message about energy and appearance. As someone who values new ideas (Strongly Agree) but is reserved and not particularly outgoing, the ad appeals to my desire for improvement without being too aggressive or sociable in its approach.
- **Purchase intention**: The product seems like it could be useful, given that I am an office worker with a busy schedule. However, while the ad is attractive, there's some skepticism due to mistrusting tendencies (Disagree) and not being easily swayed by advertisements. Therefore, I would consider buying the product but would likely conduct further research before making a decision.
