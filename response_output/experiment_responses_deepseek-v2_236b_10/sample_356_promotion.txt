Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad moderately likable (4), somewhat interesting (5), but not particularly good in terms of its presentation or message (3). It's reasonably attractive to me as a consumer who appreciates staying energized and looking one's best (4).
- Purchase Intention Scores: While the ad is not compelling enough for an immediate intention to purchase (2), it does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product out of curiosity (3) and further consideration if I find more information that supports its claims (3).
