Explanation:
- I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. It's not overly appealing due to my reserved nature and skepticism about claims of staying energized and looking one's best every day. However, as an office worker who values thoroughness and following through with plans, the promise of energy could be relevant to me.
- I find the ad interesting because it addresses a common need for energy in daily life, but I am not fully convinced of its claims without more information or evidence.
- The ad is good in that it targets a universal desire to feel and look one's best, which can resonate with many people, including myself as an office worker who might appreciate looking presentable at work.
- It is attractive because the promise aligns with my personal goals of maintaining a professional appearance and having enough energy for daily tasks. However, without additional information on how the drink achieves these results, I am not entirely sold.

Regarding purchase intention:
- While I do not strongly intend to purchase this product based on the ad alone, it does pique my interest enough that if I encounter more information or reviews about the product, I might consider trying it out of curiosity and potential utility in my daily work life.
- The ad has made me aware of the product, so should I see it available for a reasonable price or hear positive feedback from others, I may be inclined to try it at least once to assess its effectiveness personally. However, given my current skepticism and lack of strong artistic interests that might otherwise make such a claim more appealing, my intent is not high without further convincing factors.
