Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing with a focus on looking good and staying energized. As an outgoing person who values thoroughness in my job (even though it's as a student), I find the promise of energy attractive, which is reflected in scores 4 and 5 for "interesting" and "attractive." However, being generally trusting, I am not strongly convinced about the ad's claims, hence lower scores.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding the ad moderately appealing, my intention to purchase or even consider it is low. This could be due to several reasons: as someone living with parents and having a postgraduate degree, my focus might be more on academic pursuits rather than personal care products; also, while I am helpful and unselfish, my worry about making thorough decisions may lead me to research the product further before considering a purchase.
