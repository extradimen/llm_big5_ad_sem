Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat interesting and attractive (scores 4 and 5), which means it captures attention. However, the individual does not strongly agree that they like it or believe it's good (scores 3 and 2). This could be due to skepticism based on the demographic profile of a blue-collar worker who might have more practical concerns than being "energized" and looking their best every day.
- **Purchase intention**: The scores indicate low intent to purchase, with only a consideration to buy if other factors align (score 3). This could be because the individual is not easily swayed by ads due to his reserved nature and tendency to worry or mistrust promotional claims. Additionally, as someone who does not do thorough jobs and tends to be careless, immediate plans for purchasing might not be a priority.
