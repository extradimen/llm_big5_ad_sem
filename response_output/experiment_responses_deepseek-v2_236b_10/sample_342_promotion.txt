Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking), interesting enough to capture attention (score 4), perceived as good in terms of quality and message delivery (score 5), and attractive due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement (score 6). However, it's not extremely compelling or unique.
- **Purchase intention**: The ad does create some interest in the product, with a moderate intention to consider purchasing (score 2) or at least trying out the product if there is an opportunity (score 3), but the level of consideration isn't very high (score 4). There is no strong immediate plan to purchase.
