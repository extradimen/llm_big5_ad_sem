Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive (scoring 4 and 5), which indicates that it captures my attention. However, I'm not entirely convinced of its goodness or how much I like it, hence lower scores for "good" and "like."
- **Purchase intention:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider the product (score 4). While I may not be immediately intent on purchasing it, there is a possibility that I would try to buy it if other factors such as price or convenience align favorably.
