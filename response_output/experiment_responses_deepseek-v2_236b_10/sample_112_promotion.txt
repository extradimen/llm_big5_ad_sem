Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly appealing due to my reserved nature and skepticism (neutral trust), but as an outgoing person, I find it somewhat attractive because it aligns with a desire to look good socially (score 5 for attractive). However, my emotional instability and tendency to worry make me less likely to fully believe in the ad's claims (scores 3 and 2 respectively).
- **Purchase intention**: My lack of thoroughness and carefreeness might lead me to consider trying a product without much research, but my nervousness and anxiety about making plans and following through with them mean I am unlikely to strongly intend or actually follow through with the purchase (scores 1, 2, and 3 respectively).
