Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I like the ad (score 5) because it appeals to my outgoing and sociable nature. It's interesting (score 6) as it promises energy which could be appealing for social activities. However, while I believe the ad is good in general (score 5), I find it only moderately attractive (score 4) since I have strong artistic interests and the ad doesn't seem to tap into that aspect of my personality.
- **Purchase intention:** Despite having a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement, my purchase intention is low. I do not intend to purchase this product (score 1), nor will I try to buy it (score 2). While I might consider buying it if recommended by others or after further research (score 3), at this moment, the ad does not convince me enough to actively seek out the product.
