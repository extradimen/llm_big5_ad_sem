Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The ad is appealing to my outgoing and sociable nature, as it suggests that the drink can help me stay energized for social interactions. I find it interesting (6) because it aligns with my desire to look my best every day, which is important in a managerial role. However, while I like the ad (5), I'm not completely convinced of its message and don't find it particularly attractive (4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad interesting, my intention to purchase the product is low due to skepticism about its claims and because I tend to be careless and might forget or overlook following through with a purchase. My scores reflect this: I do not intend to purchase it immediately (1), will only try if reminded by someone else (2), and would consider buying it but with very little commitment (3).
