Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: I am moderately interested in the ad (score 3 for 'I like the ad'), find it somewhat intriguing (score 4 for 'interesting'), think it's just okay (score 2 for 'good'), and find it mildly attractive (score 5 for 'attractive'). As a reserved but sociable person, I appreciate ads that are not overly intrusive or pushy.
- **Purchase Intention**: My intention to purchase the product is low (score 1 for 'intend'), as my monthly income is relatively modest and there may be other priorities in spending. However, if it's within budget and aligns with my needs, I might try to buy it (score 2 for 'try') or at least consider it (score 3 for 'consider'). My tendency to worry a lot could make me cautious about new products, but an active imagination also allows me to entertain the possibility of trying something new.
