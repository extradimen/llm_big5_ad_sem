Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude:** As a reserved individual with an active imagination, I find the advertisement somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking it), interesting because it sparks curiosity about how the drink can help me look my best (score 4), and good in its promise to provide energy (score 4). The attractiveness of the ad is moderately high as it appeals to my desire for staying energized, which aligns with my thorough approach to work (score 5).
- **Purchase Intention:** While I find some aspects of the advertisement appealing, my generally distrusting nature and tendency not to be helpful or unselfish make me less inclined to immediately intend to purchase the product (score 2). However, I might try it out if there's a strong recommendation from a trusted source (score 1), and I will consider buying it based on further information that addresses my skepticism (score 3).
