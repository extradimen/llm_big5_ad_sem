Explanation:
- I like the ad (score of 3): Neutral leaning towards Agree. The advertisement's message about staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my need for energy in a managerial role, but it doesn't strongly appeal to me due to my reserved nature and skepticism.
- I think the ad is interesting (score of 4): Slightly above Neutral. While not particularly innovative or artistic, the promise of energy and appearance enhancement is somewhat intriguing.
- I believe the ad is good (score of 3): Neutral leaning towards Agree. The ad conveys a clear benefit but lacks depth in terms of how it will deliver on its promises, which aligns with my skeptical nature.
- I find the ad attractive (score of 5): Slightly above Neutral. While not overly impressed by artistic interests, the practical appeal of looking and feeling better is moderately attractive to me as someone who values emotional stability and a thorough job.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score of 2): Low intention but not dismissive. The ad's claim could be relevant for my energetic role, but without more information or trust in the brand, it doesn't strongly motivate me to buy.
- I will try to buy this product (score of 3): Neutral. There is a possibility that I might consider trying the product if other factors like reviews and price align with my expectations.
- I will consider buying this product (score of 4): Slightly above Neutral. The promise of energy and looking one's best has some appeal, so it could be on my radar for consideration when making a purchase decision. However, skepticism and the lack of thorough information about the product would weigh into my final choice.
