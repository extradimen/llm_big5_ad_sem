Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
   - I like the ad (4): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad is not particularly appealing but doesn't evoke a strong negative reaction either.
   - I think the ad is interesting (5): Somewhat positive. It holds my attention and seems engaging, although it may not be entirely unique or groundbreaking in its approach.
   - I believe the ad is good (3): Slightly negative. While there's nothing inherently wrong with the ad, it doesn't stand out as particularly effective or trustworthy based on the information provided.
   - I find the ad attractive (6): Moderately positive. The claim of staying energized and looking one's best aligns somewhat with my outgoing personality and desire to present well in social situations.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - I intend to purchase this product (2): Low intention. While the ad is moderately appealing, there isn't a strong urge or clear need for the product at this time.
   - I will try to buy this product (1): Very low intention. There's no immediate plan to seek out the product for purchase, but it doesn't rule out the possibility in the future if circumstances change.
   - I will consider buying this product (4): Moderate consideration. The ad has piqued some interest, and while there isn't a firm commitment to buy, it might be something to keep in mind or research further before making a decision.
