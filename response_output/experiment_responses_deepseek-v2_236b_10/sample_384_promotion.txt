Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing to me as a young Chinese female student with an active imagination and artistic interests. It's not overly persuasive, but it does present a positive message about energy and appearance, which could be attractive (score 5 for "attractive"). I find it somewhat interesting (score 4) and think it's a good ad in general (score 4), although my reserved nature might lead me to like it less than someone more outgoing (score 3 for "like").
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is moderately appealing, my purchase intentions are not very strong. I am inclined to consider buying the product (score 3) due to its claim about energy and appearance benefits, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or make an effort to acquire it right away (scores 2 for "intend" and "try"). My cautious nature and tendency to worry less might affect my immediate purchasing decision.
