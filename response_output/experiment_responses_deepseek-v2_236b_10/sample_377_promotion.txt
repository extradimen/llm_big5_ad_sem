Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a reserved and cautious individual who is not particularly talkative or outgoing, I find the ad to be moderately interesting (4) but not overly attractive (2). It's good enough in my view (3), but it doesn't strongly resonate with me. The claim of looking one's best every day may not align fully with my values as someone who places more emphasis on thoroughness and reliability rather than appearance-focused products.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile, which includes a lower monthly income and the fact that I am single without dependents, my purchasing decisions are likely to be conservative. Therefore, while I might consider (2) buying this product if it fits within my budget and aligns with my needs for energy during work hours, I don't have a strong intention (1) or immediate plan to try (1) the product unless there is clear evidence of its benefits that would justify the expense.
