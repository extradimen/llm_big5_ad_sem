Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4), somewhat interesting (score 5), considered good but not strongly so (score 3), and found to be attractive enough to draw some attention (score 4). This suggests that while it's not an overwhelmingly positive response, the ad does have elements that are appealing.
- **Purchase intention**: The intent to purchase is low (score 2) indicating a lack of strong motivation to buy immediately, with only a slight willingness to try and buy if other factors align (score 1). However, there's still some consideration for purchasing in the future (score 3), which means the product isn't dismissed entirely but would require further convincing or evaluation.
