Explanation:
- I moderately like the ad (score 3) as it seems to offer a benefit that could be appealing.
- I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4), but not overly engaging due to my reserved nature and preference for more concrete information rather than general claims about energy and appearance.
- While I believe the ad is decent (score 3), its appeal may be limited by its broad messaging that doesn't resonate deeply with me, given my cautious approach to trusting advertisements.
- The ad appears moderately attractive (score 4) in terms of visual presentation, but it does not strongly connect with my artistic interests or need for originality.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I have a low intent to immediately purchase the product (score 2), as I am skeptical and tend to worry about making impulsive decisions without thorough research.
- The ad has prompted me to think about trying the product (score 1) if there is solid evidence of its benefits, but this would depend on further information and not just based on the advertisement alone.
- I might consider buying the product (score 3), especially if it aligns with my values of being helpful and unselfish, assuming that the energy boost could benefit others as well; however, this consideration is contingent upon more detailed reviews and personal research before making a final decision.
