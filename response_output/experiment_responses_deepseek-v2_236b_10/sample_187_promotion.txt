Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is moderately liked (score 3), finds it interesting (score 4) and good (score 4), and slightly more attractive (score 5). This suggests that while not strongly engaged, there is some positive reception to the message.
- **Purchase intention:** There is a moderate intent to purchase (score 2), willingness to try buying the product (score 1), but also consideration of purchasing it (score 3). This indicates mixed feelings about actually acquiring the product despite having an overall favorable view of the ad.
