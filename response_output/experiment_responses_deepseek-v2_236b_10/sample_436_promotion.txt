}

Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad somewhat appealing (3) and interesting (4), which is reflected in my belief that it's good (5). However, the attractiveness of the ad stands out more to me (6), as it aligns with my desire for products that can help maintain energy levels.
- Purchase intention: Despite finding the ad attractive, my purchase intent is low (1) because I prefer to research thoroughly before trying a new product (2). Nevertheless, I might consider buying it in the future (3), depending on further information and reviews.
