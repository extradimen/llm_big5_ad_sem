Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a civil servant with an emphasis on being thorough and having new ideas (Strongly Agree), I find the ad's claim to help stay energized and look one's best appealing. It is interesting because it aligns with my practical approach to life, and attractive as it suggests a benefit that could be useful for both personal and professional appearances. However, I am not overly enthusiastic about liking or believing in the ad's goodness due to my neutral stance on sociability and talkativeness, which means I might view advertisements more critically.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I find the ad somewhat compelling, as someone who values making plans and following through with them (Agree), I am not immediately inclined to purchase the product without further consideration. The score of 2 for "intend" indicates a low likelihood of immediate action, but the scores of 3 and 4 for "try" and "consider" suggest that it is possible I might look into the product more if there are additional factors such as reviews or personal recommendations that align with my values on thoroughness and reliability.
