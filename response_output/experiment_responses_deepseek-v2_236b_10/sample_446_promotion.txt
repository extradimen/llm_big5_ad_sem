Explanation: As a virtual person with the given demographic profile and personality traits, my response to the advertisement is as follows:

- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral leaning towards Agree. The ad's message about staying energized aligns with my need for energy at work, but it doesn't strongly resonate due to my reserved nature and skepticism.
  
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because of its promise to help look one's best, which could be appealing despite my lack of artistic interests.
  
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral leaning towards Agree. The ad appears well-intentioned with a positive message, but without strong evidence or testimonials, it doesn't fully convince me of its goodness.
  
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): More than neutral because even though I am not talkative and have few artistic interests, the idea of looking my best is an aspirational goal that can be appealing to anyone.

Regarding purchase intention:

- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly Disagree. The ad does not provide enough information or credibility for me to feel confident in making an immediate purchase decision.
  
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards Disagree. While the ad has some appeal, my skepticism and general distrusting nature make it unlikely that I would actively seek out the product without further convincing.
  
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral. The promise of looking one's best is appealing enough to keep the option open for consideration, but more information or a trusted recommendation would be needed before seriously considering a purchase.
