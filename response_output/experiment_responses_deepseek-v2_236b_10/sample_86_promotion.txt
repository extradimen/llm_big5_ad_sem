Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: As a talkative and outgoing individual who tends to be trusting and thorough in his job, the advertisement's claim that it helps stay energized and look one's best is appealing. However, with a neutral stance on emotional stability and a strong agreement on having few artistic interests, the ad doesn't resonate as strongly on an emotional or creative level. Therefore, while finding the ad interesting (6) and somewhat good (5), its attractiveness is moderate (4).
- **Purchase Intention**: Despite liking the ad to some extent, the individual does not seem highly motivated to purchase the product. This could be due to being divorced with a student occupation and a relatively high monthly income within Vietnamese Dong, which might suggest other priorities or skepticism about the advertised benefits. Thus, there is no strong intention to buy (1), nor a plan to try it (2), but there is an openness to considering it (3).
