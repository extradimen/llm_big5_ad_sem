Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a young male civil servant with an outgoing personality and strong work ethic (agreeing to being sociable, doing thorough job, making plans), the ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best aligns well with my professional image. I find it attractive (score 6) because it appeals to maintaining a good appearance and energy levels, which are important for my role as a civil servant. The ad is interesting (score 5) and good (score 5), but not overwhelmingly so, given my reserved nature and skepticism (strongly disagree with being generally trusting).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I find the ad appealing, my purchase intention is moderate. I intend to consider buying the product (score 4), which means it's on my radar for potential future purchases if I see value in it for maintaining energy levels and appearance at work. However, there is no immediate strong intent to buy or try immediately (scores 2 and 3). This reflects a balance between interest and practical considerations such as budget and the need for more information about the product's effectiveness.
