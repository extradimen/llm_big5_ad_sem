Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a talkative and helpful individual with an Agree stance on doing thorough jobs, the advertisement's promise of energy and looking one's best resonates somewhat with my values. However, being reserved and neutral about outgoing sociability means I am not strongly attracted to flashy or overly social-focused ads. Therefore:
  - **I like the ad:** Score 3 (Neutral) - The ad is acceptable but not particularly appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance rather than deeper values.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Score 4 (Agree slightly) - It catches my attention with its promise, which aligns with my Agree stance on making plans and following through.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Score 3 (Neutral) - The ad seems to do a job but doesn't stand out as particularly credible or compelling based on my personality traits.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Score 5 (Agree moderately) - While not overly outgoing, the promise of looking one's best is somewhat appealing, especially if it aligns with personal goals related to thoroughness and care for oneself.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite having an Agree stance on making plans and following through, my income level and age might limit immediate purchase intention:
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** Score 2 (Disagree slightly) - The low monthly income makes a strong commitment difficult without more information or assurance of value.
  - **I will try to buy this product:** Score 2 (Disagree slightly) - Similar reasoning as above, coupled with the fact that I am already past my prime student years and might not be the target demographic for energy-boosting products.
  - **I will consider buying this product:** Score 3 (Neutral) - If more information is available or if it seems particularly beneficial within my budget constraints, then there's a possibility of considering the purchase.
