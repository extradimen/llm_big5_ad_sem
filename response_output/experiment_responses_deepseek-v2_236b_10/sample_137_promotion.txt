Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a reserved individual with an active imagination and some originality, I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 5) because it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. However, I am not strongly outgoing or sociable, so the appeal is not as strong in terms of liking the ad (score 3). The ad's claim about staying energized interests me (score 4), but given my neutral stance on trustworthiness, I do not rate it highly as being a good advertisement overall (score 2).
- **Purchase intention:** Despite finding the ad somewhat attractive, my tendency to make plans and follow through with them is low. Therefore, while I might consider buying the product if there's an opportunity or recommendation from someone else (score 3), I do not intend to actively seek it out (score 1). There's a possibility that if presented with the product in a store, I may try to buy it based on the ad's influence (score 2).
