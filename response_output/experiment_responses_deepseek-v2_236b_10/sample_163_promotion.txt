Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score of 3), which is not very high because it's a common claim that many products make. However, I think it's good (score of 6) and interesting (score of 5) as it targets energy and appearance, which are relevant to my age group and occupation.
- **Purchase intention**: My scores for purchase intention are low (1, 2, 3), indicating that while the ad is not unappealing, I am not strongly motivated to buy the product based on the advertisement alone. It would require more information or a personal need to increase my interest in purchasing it.
