Explanation:
- The advertisement is not particularly engaging for me due to my reserved personality and lack of interest in new ideas or artistic interests. However, I am generally trusting, which somewhat increases my perception of the ad's credibility. Therefore, while I find it moderately attractive (5), I don't strongly agree that it's good or interesting.
- My purchase intention is low because although I might consider buying the product (3), given my neutral stance on helpfulness and unselfishness with others, there isn't a strong desire to either intend to buy it immediately or try hard to do so. The scores reflect this cautious approach to purchasing decisions based on the advertisement presented.
