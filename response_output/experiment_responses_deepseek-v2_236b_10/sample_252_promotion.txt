Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly appealing to me as an older individual with a postgraduate degree and few artistic interests, but it doesn't offend me either. The claim that the drink helps stay energized is somewhat attractive, hence the score of 5 for "attractive."
- **Purchase intention**: While I find some aspects of the ad interesting (score of 4), my purchase intention is low. As an individual with a relatively stable emotional state and not particularly concerned about staying "energized" or looking one's best every day, the product doesn't align strongly with my needs or values. Therefore, my scores for purchase intention are all on the lower end of the scale, indicating minimal interest in actually buying the product.
