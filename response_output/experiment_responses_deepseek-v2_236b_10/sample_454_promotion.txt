Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. The ad is moderately attractive (score 5) as it claims to provide energy and enhance appearance, which could be appealing even though I am reserved and not overly outgoing or talkative. However, my artistic interests are limited, so while the ad isn't uninteresting (score 4), it doesn't stand out as exceptionally good (score 2). My liking for the ad is also tempered by my tendency to worry a lot, which might make me skeptical of such claims (score 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite having some interest in the ad, my purchase intention is low. I am generally helpful and unselfish with others, but this doesn't necessarily translate into purchasing behavior without more compelling reasons or benefits that align with my values and needs. The score of 1 for "intend" reflects a lack of immediate desire to buy, while scores of 2 and 3 indicate some openness to considering the product in the future if other factors such as trustworthiness and thoroughness (which I value) are established.
