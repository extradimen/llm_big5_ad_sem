Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a talkative and outgoing person who also values thoroughness in her work (strong agreement with doing a thorough job), I find the ad interesting (score 6) because it aligns with my need to stay energized for my blue-collar job. However, while I like the ad (score 5) and believe it is good (score 5), I am not strongly attracted to it (score 4) as I have few artistic interests and may not be drawn in by visual appeal alone.
- **Purchase intention:** Although I find the ad interesting, my purchase intention is moderate. I will consider buying this product (score 4) because of its claim to help with energy levels, which is relevant for my job. However, I am not immediately planning to buy it (score 2), and while I might try to do so in the future (score 3), my financial constraints as a low-income worker may limit my ability to purchase such products impulsively.
