Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately attractive (score 6) because it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. However, while I think it is interesting (score 5), I am not fully convinced that it's a good ad (score 3). My score for liking the ad is moderate at 4, reflecting some interest but also skepticism due to my reserved nature towards advertising claims.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my personality traits and demographic profile, I do not have strong intentions to purchase the product immediately (score 1), although I might try to look into it more (score 2). It's a possibility that I will consider buying this product in the future (score 3), but there is no immediate plan or commitment.
