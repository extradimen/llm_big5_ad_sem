Explanation:
- The ad is somewhat liked (score 2), it's not particularly appealing to me due to my reserved and less outgoing personality. However, the claim of staying energized does catch some interest (score 3). I find it moderately attractive (score 4) as it aligns with my desire for an active imagination and new ideas, even though I have few artistic interests.
- In terms of purchase intention, I am not strongly inclined to buy the product immediately (score 1), but if there's a good offer or recommendation from a trusted source, I might try it out (score 2). It's in my consideration set for now (score 3) because staying energized is relevant to my work as a civil servant. However, my lack of trust and tendency towards being careless may reduce the likelihood of an actual purchase without further reassurance or influence from others.
