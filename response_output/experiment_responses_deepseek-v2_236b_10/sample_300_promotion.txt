Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive about liking the ad. It's not particularly appealing but also not off-putting.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly above neutral, finding some interest in the claim of energy and looking one's best.
  3. I believe the ad is good (2): Slightly below neutral, skepticism about whether the ad can deliver on its promise without more information.
  4. I find the ad attractive (5): Somewhat positive due to the universal appeal of feeling energized and looking good, which might catch attention despite potential reservations.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree because there's not enough information or trust in the claim to make a definitive purchasing decision.
  2. I will try to buy this product (3): Neutral, as it's open for consideration if other factors such as reviews, price, and availability align favorably.
  3. I will consider buying this product (2): Slightly below neutral, indicating some interest but with reservations that would require more information or persuasion before a decision is made.
