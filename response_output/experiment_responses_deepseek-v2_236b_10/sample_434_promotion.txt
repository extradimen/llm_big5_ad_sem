Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. However, while I think it's interesting enough to catch my attention (score 5), I don't necessarily believe it's a good advertisement overall (score 3). My like for the ad is moderate (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad attractive, my purchase intention is low. I am considering buying the product (score 3) but not with high intent. I might try to buy it if circumstances align (score 1), but there's no strong intention to do so at this moment (score 2).
