Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is not particularly compelling or attractive to me (score 2 for attractive), but it does seem interesting (score 4) and potentially good in its message (score 5). I do not strongly dislike it, hence a neutral like score (3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does not resonate deeply with my personality traits or values, it doesn't completely turn me off either. Therefore, if there is an opportunity to try the product out of curiosity (score 2), I might consider it (score 3) but do not have a strong intent to purchase at this moment (score 1).
