Explanation of Scores:
- The advertisement seems to be promoting a drink that claims to provide energy and improve appearance. As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its promise of staying energized (which could be beneficial for long working hours), but I am skeptical about the claim regarding looking my best every day, hence lower scores on attractiveness and goodness.
- My personality traits such as being helpful, trusting, making plans, and being emotionally stable lead me to consider the ad's claims seriously, which is reflected in a moderately positive attitude towards the ad (scores 5 for liking and thinking it's good, 6 for finding it interesting).
- However, my reserved nature and tendency to worry may make me more cautious about making quick purchasing decisions. This is why I score lower on purchase intention (3 for considering buying but not strongly intending or trying to buy immediately).
