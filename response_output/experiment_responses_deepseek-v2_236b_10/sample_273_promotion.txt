Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly appealing but it's not unlikable either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because it mentions staying energized and looking one's best, which could be relevant to my age group.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Below neutral because while it's not offensive or bad, there isn't a strong sense of credibility or uniqueness that would make me consider it as particularly 'good'.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly above neutral due to the positive messaging about energy and appearance. However, without more specific information on how this drink accomplishes these benefits, the attractiveness is limited.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. The advertisement does not provide enough convincing evidence for me to make an immediate decision to buy it.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards disagreement. While the ad is somewhat interesting, there isn't a strong urge or reason to actively seek out and purchase the drink right away.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Slightly above neutral because if more information was provided that aligns with my needs and concerns, such as health benefits for seniors, then it could be something worth considering further in future purchases.
