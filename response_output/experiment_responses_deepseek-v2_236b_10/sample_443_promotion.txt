Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking it), interesting enough to hold my attention (score 4), and generally good in its presentation (score 4). The attractiveness of the ad is moderately high as it does suggest a benefit that could be relevant to me, hence score 5.
- Purchase Intention Scores: I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product based on the ad alone (score 1 for intent), but I might try to look into more information about it (score 2). Depending on what additional details and reviews show, I could consider purchasing the product in the future (score 3).
