Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likeable (score 4), interesting enough to engage my attention (score 5), and generally good in terms of presentation (score 4). However, the attractiveness is somewhat lower because while it's visually appealing, the claim about looking one's best every day feels a bit superficial for someone with a pragmatic approach as a civil servant.
- **Purchase intention**: I have some interest in trying out the product due to its promise of energy (score 2), which aligns with my outgoing nature and need for thoroughness at work. However, considering buying it doesn't mean that I will definitely purchase it; there might be other factors such as price or brand trustworthiness that could influence my final decision (score 4).
