Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a manager with a postgraduate degree and an outgoing personality, I find the ad moderately appealing. It is interesting (5) because it promises energy and appearance benefits, which are relevant to my professional life. However, while I think the ad is good (5), I am not strongly attracted by it (3).
- **Purchase intention:** Despite having a positive view of the advertisement, my purchase intention is relatively low due to my skeptical nature and preference for thorough research before making purchasing decisions. I will consider buying the product (3) if there is credible evidence supporting its claims, but I do not intend to immediately buy it (1), nor am I committed to trying it out right away (2).
