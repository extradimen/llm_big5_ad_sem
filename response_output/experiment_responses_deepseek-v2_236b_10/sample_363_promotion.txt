Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking it), interesting enough to pay attention to (score 5), and generally good in its presentation (score 4). However, I'm not particularly attracted by it (score 3), as it doesn't resonate deeply with my personal values or interests.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is moderately appealing, my intention to purchase the product is low at this moment (score 2 for trying to buy). I might consider buying it if there are additional factors such as a recommendation from a trusted source or a need that arises in the future (score 3), but currently, I do not have a strong intent to seek out and buy the product based on the ad alone (score 1 for intending to purchase).
