Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad to be somewhat attractive and good, but not extremely so. It's interesting enough to catch my attention, hence the scores ranging from neutral (3) to agree slightly (5).
- Purchase intention: While the ad is appealing, as a reserved individual who values thoroughness and planning, I would consider buying the product rather than immediately intending or trying to buy it. The scores reflect this cautious approach, with 2 indicating an initial inclination to try, 3 for consideration, and 4 showing some positive interest in potential purchase.
