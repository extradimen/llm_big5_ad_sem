Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (4): The advertisement is appealing as it promises to help stay energized and look one's best, which aligns with my desire for a healthy lifestyle.
  - I think the ad is interesting (5): It presents an attractive proposition that could be of interest to someone looking for daily energy boosts.
  - I believe the ad is good (4): While it makes claims about the product's benefits, there is a need for more information to assess its credibility fully.
  - I find the ad attractive (3): The promise of staying energized and looking one's best every day is an appealing concept, but without further details, it doesn't strongly resonate.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (2): There is some interest in trying out a new drink that claims to offer daily energy, but more information would be needed before committing to a purchase.
  - I will try to buy this product (1): While there's an initial curiosity about the product, it doesn't strongly compel immediate action without further convincing evidence or reviews.
  - I will consider buying this product (3): The advertisement piques interest but does not provide enough information for a strong purchase intention; therefore, consideration would depend on additional details and possibly recommendations from others.
