}

Explanation of the scores:

- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is appealing to my outgoing and sociable nature, as it suggests that staying energized can help me look my best for social interactions. I find it interesting (6) because it aligns with my desire to be at my best in social settings. I moderately like the ad (5) and find it somewhat attractive (4), but not overly compelling on its own.

- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is intriguing, my purchase intentions are only moderate. I intend to consider buying the product (4), as staying energized aligns with my active lifestyle, but I'm not fully committed to trying or purchasing the product immediately (2 and 3). This reflects a cautious approach based on my general trustworthiness and thoroughness in making decisions.
