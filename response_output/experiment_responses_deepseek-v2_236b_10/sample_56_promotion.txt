Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likeable (4), quite interesting (5), not entirely convinced that it's good (3), but it is visually attractive to me (6). The ad appeals to my outgoing and sociable nature, suggesting a product that can help maintain energy levels for daily activities.
- **Purchase intention**: I have low intent to purchase the product at this moment (1), mainly because of my strong disagreement with making plans and following through with them. However, I might try to buy it if there's an opportunity (2) or consider buying it when I see more information about its benefits (3). The ad has not yet convinced me enough to make a purchase decision immediately but could influence my consideration in the future.
