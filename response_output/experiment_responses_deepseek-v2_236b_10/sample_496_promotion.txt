Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best is somewhat appealing but not particularly strong in its appeal.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more positive, as it suggests that the ad captures some attention with its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  - I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive again, indicating a general acceptance of the ad's quality without strong enthusiasm.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 5): More positive here, as it acknowledges that there is an attractiveness in the promise of daily benefits, which aligns with the desire for emotional stability and helpfulness towards self-care.
  
- **Purchase intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Slightly below neutral, indicating a low immediate intent to buy but not dismissing it outright due to trustfulness and openness to new ideas.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 3): Neutral score, suggesting that while there's no strong push to actively seek out the product, it's not entirely ruled out either.
  - I will consider buying this product (score 4): Slightly positive, indicating a willingness to at least think about purchasing the product if other factors align or after further consideration.
