**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - While not strongly liking it, I appreciate its simple message of staying energized and looking good.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning towards a slight positive; it has an appealing concept but doesn't captivate me deeply.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - It seems straightforward and honest, which aligns with my generally trusting nature.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly due to its generic presentation; it lacks a personal connection or unique appeal for me.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree because my current budget constraints and priorities don't include regular purchases of energy drinks.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards a slight 'no'; occasional indulgences are out of reach given the limited monthly income.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - A neutral score indicating I'm open-minded but not actively considering it, balancing my practical needs and potential benefits.

Overall, while the ad presents an appealing concept for staying energized and looking good, its generic nature doesn't strongly resonate with me personally or financially. Consequently, my purchase intent remains low due to budget constraints and prioritization of other necessities.
