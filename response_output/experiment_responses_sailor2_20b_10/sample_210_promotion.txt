**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (5)*: I find the ad appealing to a degree but not overwhelmingly so. The concept of staying energized and looking good is relatable.
  - *Interesting (4)*: It sparks mild interest, especially given my active lifestyle and focus on wellness.
  - *Good (6)*: On balance, it presents positive values that align with the idea of personal care and productivity.
  - *Attractive (3)*: While not highly attractive, it's decently engaging—partially due to its clear messaging but could be more visually compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend (2)*: Despite appreciating the ad’s message, I’m not convinced enough yet to actively seek out this product.
  - *Try (1)*: Low intention to try; other alternatives and priorities take precedence in my current budget and lifestyle.
  - *Consider (3)*: It does get a spot on my consideration list, particularly during periods when additional energy boosts are needed. However, it's not a top priority due to existing dietary practices.

In summary, while the ad resonates moderately with its promise of vitality and appearance, I am not strongly driven to purchase this product primarily because other lifestyle factors (e.g., regular routines) provide similar benefits without needing an extra supplement or drink. The score balances recognition of the message’s importance against personal habits and current priorities.
