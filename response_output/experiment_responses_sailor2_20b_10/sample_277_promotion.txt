**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (3)**: Neutral response because while appealing in some aspects, it doesn't strongly resonate due to personal preference.
   - **Interesting (4)**: Agreed; the promise of energy and enhanced appearance is compelling for daily routines.
   - **Good (5)**: Strongly Agree; aligns with my values on maintaining health and confidence.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Disagree; though appealing, the ad lacks personal connection to make it visually or emotionally attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral due to balancing practicality against budget constraints but recognizing potential benefits.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Agree as I see value in giving a new product a chance despite not being compelled immediately by the ad.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree; even though initial interest isnâ€™t high, long-term utility aligns with my goals and originality trait.

Overall, while the advertisement is effective at highlighting benefits that appeal to maintaining health and appearance, its attractiveness falls short of a strong personal connection. The product remains in consideration for purchase despite mixed impressions from the ad itself.
