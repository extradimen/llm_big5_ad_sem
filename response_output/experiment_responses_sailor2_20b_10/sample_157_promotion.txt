3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)** - The message of staying energized and looking your best has broad appeal; however, my neutral stance on worrying balances out enthusiasm for its claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4)** - While not highly compelling, it's moderately appealing due to its practical benefits but doesn't strongly align with my reserved nature or preferences.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 5)** - Despite being single and having moderate monthly income, the promise of sustained energy appeals, though I donâ€™t see an urgent need.

3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 7)** - The thorough planning and cautious nature lead me to seriously contemplate purchasing, even if not immediately essential.
