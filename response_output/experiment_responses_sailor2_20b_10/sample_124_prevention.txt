**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Like the Ad**: Neutral (5) - The ad’s message is straightforward, but it doesn’t particularly excite me.
2. **Interesting**: Moderately interesting (4). It conveys a clear benefit but lacks engaging content or innovative elements that would capture my attention fully.
3. **Believe the Ad is Good**: Agree (6). While not exceptional, I find its preventive approach to tiredness and dull looks credible enough.
4. **Attractive**: Slightly attractive (3). The ad appeals moderately due to its functional benefit but doesn’t inspire strong interest.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Mild intention (2) - While the product seems useful, other factors like brand preference and price would heavily influence my decision.
2. **Try to Buy**: Consider trying (3). Given the potential benefits described, I might give it a chance if conveniently available or during promotional periods.
3. **Consider Buying**: Neutral-leaning towards considering (4) - My unselfish nature and general belief in its effectiveness make me open to purchasing but not compelled yet.

Overall, though the ad has elements of credibility and utility, my somewhat reserved personality and tendency toward thoroughness don't push me strongly into immediate purchase intent, favoring cautious consideration instead.
