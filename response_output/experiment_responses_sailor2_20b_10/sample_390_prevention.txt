**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like (Score: 4):* Neutral but slightly positive; the message about fatigue and appearance resonates with my active lifestyle.
   - *Interesting (Score: 5):* Finds it engaging as addressing common concerns of being tired or dull can attract attention, especially among students balancing studies and social life.
   - *Good (Score: 6):* Appreciate its clarity on potential benefits—avoiding fatigue and looking more vibrant—but not exceptionally impressive in creativity.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3):* Neutral leaning towards slightly unattractive; the straightforward warning tone lacks emotional appeal compared to my outgoing nature.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend (Score: 2):* Not strong intention due to cautious approach and skepticism over immediate benefits.
   - *Try (Score: 3):* Open-minded but not compelled, as personal stress management methods take priority; still may consider giving it a try if reviews are positive.
   - *Consider (Score: 4):* Will definitely keep the product in mind for future purchases when dealing with periods of high workload or low energy.

In summary, while I find the advertisement interesting and acknowledge its good points, my overall attitude is moderately favorable. My purchase intention falls into a considerate range but lacks firm commitment due to personal preference for proven methods over quick fixes and emotional stability concerns.
