**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (4 - Neutral):**
  Although talkative by nature, I find the statement overly dramatic and not personally relatable.

- **I think the ad is interesting. (3 - Disagree):**
  The simplicity of the message ("you may feel tired and look dull") lacks intrigue; it feels generic rather than engaging.

- **I believe the ad is good. (2 - Strongly Disagree):**
  As a blue-collar worker, I prioritize more practical information over vague health claims without substantiation or relatable testimonials.

- **I find the ad attractive. (1 - Strongly Disagree):**
  The lack of visual appeal and emotional connection makes it unattractive to me; my preference leans toward ads with compelling visuals and genuine endorsements.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product. (2 - Neutral/Disagree):** 
  While the advertisement's claims are somewhat relevant, there isn't enough convincing detail for immediate action.

- **Will try to buy this product. (2 - Disagree):**
  I am cautious and generally skeptical of health-related products without clear evidence or familiarity with the brand.

- **Will consider buying this product. (1 - Strongly Disagree):**
  Given my monthly income constraints, limited trust in such ads, and low emotional connection to their messaging, there's little incentive for me to seriously consider purchasing it.

Overall, though I am somewhat sociable and talkative, the ad fails to resonate with my experiences or build sufficient credibility. Thus, both attitudes towards the advertisement and purchase intentions are relatively negative.
