**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 3)**: The ad is somewhat appealing due to its straightforward message but doesn't strongly resonate.
    - **Interesting (Score: 2)**: It's mildly interesting because it addresses common concerns about tiredness and appearance, but lacks compelling creativity or novelty.
    - **Good (Score: 2)**: While the content makes sense, the overall presentation is average; nothing exceptional to consider "good."
    - **Attractive (Score: 1)**: The ad doesn't draw me in significantly due to its potentially manipulative tone and lack of personal connection.

- **Purchase intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase**: I'm inclined but not strongly motivated because the benefits need practical proof.
    - **Try to buy**: With a cautious approach, I might consider giving it a trial to see if it helps with my energy levels.
    - **Consider buying**: The product is on my radar for consideration given its potential relevance to feeling refreshed, despite reservations about advertising tactics.

Overall, the ad sparks some interest but falls short of compelling me strongly due to personal preferences and critical views. I'll keep an open mind but won't rush into a purchase decision without further evidence or experience.
