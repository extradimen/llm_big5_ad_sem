**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 3):**
   - Although I don't typically find myself drawn to overly energetic or beauty-centric advertising due to my reserved nature, this drink's promise of staying energized does capture some interest.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):**
   - The concept appeals as it aligns with a need for daily energy but doesn’t wow me since other factors like personal habits influence my routine significantly more.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):**
   - It's straightforward and clear in its message, making it somewhat persuasive on a basic level. However, I’m generally skeptical of quick-fix solutions for daily energy management.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 3):**
   - While not strongly visually or conceptually appealing to me, it’s passably well-done without striking my fancy due to my strong tendencies toward practicality over flashy marketing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2 – Neutral/Disagree):**
   - Given my thorough job and planning traits, I value consistent routines that don’t rely on external boosts unless proven effective long-term. The ad alone isn't enough to make a decisive switch.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1 – Strongly Disagree):**
   - My tendency towards being careful with purchases means trying new products without substantial research or recommendations doesn’t align well with my decision-making process.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 2 – Neutral/Disagree):**
   - The idea of improving daily energy could be explored further, but I won't make a hasty buy; instead, it's on the back burner for future consideration if backed by more credible information or personal experience.

Overall, while not strongly turned off, my reserved and careful nature means this ad doesn’t generate immediate enthusiasm or action. Practicality and thoroughness in decisions keep me from leaning towards purchase intention despite its clear messaging.
