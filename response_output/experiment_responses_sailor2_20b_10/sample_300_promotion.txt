**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (score = 4):** While I appreciate its attempt to make health benefits appealing, my reserved nature and sometimes cynical approach mean it doesn't fully resonate with me.
   - **Interesting:** The idea of staying energized is compelling but falls short on engagement for someone who leans towards a more deliberate lifestyle (Neutral to Agree).
   - **Good:** It conveys core benefits well enough; however, its simplicity may not convince those seeking detailed product information (Agree).
   - **Attractive:** Given my strong tendency toward emotional stability and practicality, the ad feels slightly over-promising but still somewhat attractive on a superficial level (Disagree to Neutral).

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 4):** Despite liking parts of it, my decision-making process is methodical and skeptical; hence, I don't fully commit without additional research.
   - **Try to buy:** My generally trustworthy nature makes me willing to give products a try based on credible claims but not immediately (Agree).
   - **Consider buying:** The combination of health benefits appeal enough for cautious consideration alongside personal experience or reviews. High monthly income allows room for exploring new wellness options (Strongly Agree).

Overall, while the ad is interesting and well-presented, my reserved and careful nature means it may need more substantiation to secure a purchase without further investigation. Hence, moderate scores reflect this balanced evaluation of interest versus commitment.
