**Evaluation Details:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**: Given my reserved and sometimes rude tendencies, I'm neutral to slightly negative about this energetic and image-focused message.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 2)**: The promise of staying energized appeals minimally but does not grab my interest strongly.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**: While it’s functional, it doesn’t align deeply with my values or daily needs; neutral leaning positive.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**: The overall appeal feels somewhat superficial and out of sync with my personality.

**Purchase Intention:**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree – My current financial situation (<15,000,000 VND/month) limits luxury or non-essential purchases.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**: Slightly agree; I might consider it under certain discounts but not as a priority.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning slightly positive – It’s in the back of my mind, especially if affordability and necessity change.

Overall, while the ad doesn’t resonate deeply or feel compelling due to its energetic focus and lack of alignment with my reserved personality, it retains minimal consideration for future purchase scenarios but remains low priority at present.
