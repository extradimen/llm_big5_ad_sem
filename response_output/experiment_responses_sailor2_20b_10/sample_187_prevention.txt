**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **Like:** *4* – While I appreciate talkative and imaginative traits, this claim feels a bit exaggerated. It's somewhat engaging but not overly impressive.
  - **Interesting:** *3* – The ad is moderately interesting, hinting at potential benefits of avoiding tiredness and looking dull, but lacks depth or novelty that would truly captivate me.
  - **Good:** *2* – I believe the message could be more grounded in reality. Its simplicity makes it slightly unconvincing for someone like me who worries about credibility.
  - **Attractive:** *1* – The ad's appeal is low because of its overemphasis on a universal feeling (tiredness) and lack of specific details or emotional resonance.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** *2* – Despite the persuasive effort, my tendency towards carelessness and nervousness means I'm not driven enough by this ad alone.
  - **Try to Buy:** *1* – I don't have a strong desire or immediate plan based on this advertisement; it lacks personal relevance given my lifestyle and current priorities.
  - **Consider Buying:** *2* – There is minimal consideration due to doubts about the product's effectiveness, but if other factors align (e.g., peer recommendations), I might give it a shot.

In summary, while acknowledging its basic appeal, the ad doesn't strongly motivate me as an individual with my personality traits and cautious nature. More compelling evidence or emotional hooks would be necessary for higher engagement and purchase intent.
