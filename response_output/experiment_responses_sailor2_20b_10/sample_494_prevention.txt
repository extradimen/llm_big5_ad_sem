**Evaluation:**

- **Attitudinal Responses:**
    - **I like the ad (Score: 5):** The concept of preventing tiredness and looking dull appeals to my pragmatic side; however, it doesn't strongly resonate due to its somewhat exaggerated tone.
    - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 6):** It captures attention with clear messaging but falls short on originality given common fatigue-related ads in this category.
    - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4):** The message can be effective, but it lacks emotional depth and creativity that would make me strongly support it.
    - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3):** While visually acceptable, its straightforwardness doesn't captivate my active imagination or creative preferences.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):** Despite understanding the benefits, I'm not fully convinced by this particular advertisement.
    - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 1):** My cautious nature and tendency towards thoroughness suggest that a more compelling demonstration of efficacy would sway me.
    - **Consider buying it (Score: 3):** Given my busy managerial lifestyle, the idea of combating fatigue has some merit. Hence, I'm open to considering but need further information or reviews.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional benefits and appreciating an attempt at problem-solving, my score balances towards a neutral-to-slightly-positive attitude with cautious purchase intent due to other factors like personal preferences and advertising style.
