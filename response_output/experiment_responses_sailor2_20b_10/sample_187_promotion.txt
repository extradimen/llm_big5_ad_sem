**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (3) - Given my talkative nature and strong agreement on being trusting, I find it appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting**: Moderate (4) - The concept of staying energized resonates with me as an office worker needing focus, making it somewhat intriguing.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5) - The idea aligns well with my desire to perform better and look good, suggesting positive benefits.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (2) - My tendency towards carelessness means I might not be swayed purely by aesthetic appeal alone.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (3) - The ad’s message is compelling but doesn't automatically drive a strong immediate purchase decision.
   - **Try to Buy**: Agree (4) - There's enough motivation from the benefits to at least give it a try, especially as someone who values convenience and personal appearance.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree (5) - The combination of health and aesthetic promises aligns well with my lifestyle, making me seriously consider including this product in my routine.

Overall, while I appreciate aspects of the ad’s message and find it somewhat persuasive, my cautious nature means I won't rush into a purchase but am open to giving it serious consideration.
