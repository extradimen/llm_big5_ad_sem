**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
   - **Like (Score: 3)** – While I appreciate its attempt to address fatigue and appearance, it feels a bit over-the-top.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)** – The concept of preventing tiredness is intriguing enough but could be more engaging for my taste.
   - **Good (Score: 2)** – It lacks depth in the message delivery; credibility needs improvement without strong claims supporting its efficacy.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)** – Attractive, yes, to some extent, but not strongly compelling.

- **Purchase intention:** 
   - **Intend (Score: 5)** – I might consider it since staying energetic is important. However, the ad doesn't sway me into a strong purchase decision.
   - **Try (Score: 4)** – There's enough interest to give it a try if price and availability are right; cautious optimism.
   - **Consider (Score: 6)** – Definitely on my radar for future consideration given its focus aligns with managing fatigue, but not an immediate priority.

In summary, while the ad catches attention due to addressing common concerns, further details or testimonials would enhance trust. Despite a generally positive outlook, it doesn't push me to purchase immediately but keeps the product in potential consideration.
