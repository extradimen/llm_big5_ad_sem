**Evaluation Details:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - I like the ad (Score = 3): While it's not strongly disliked, there’s a neutral to slightly positive reaction.
   - I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4): The concept of feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat but isn't highly captivating.
   - I believe the ad is good (Score = 5): It conveys a clear message effectively, though it doesn’t evoke strong belief or trust due to personal inclination towards skepticism about health claims in ads.
   - I find the ad attractive (Score = 2): Being more focused on practicality and less drawn by visual appeal or emotional manipulation.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I intend to purchase this product (Score = 3): Neutral but slightly leaning toward consideration due to daily experience with fatigue.
