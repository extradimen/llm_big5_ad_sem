**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - While I don't strongly dislike it, the ad feels a bit superficial and doesn’t deeply resonate with my daily concerns.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - It's mildly engaging but not very compelling given my current priorities as a blue-collar worker focused on reliability and efficiency rather than aesthetics or energy boosts.
3. **Good (Score: 2)** - I find the message somewhat generic; it lacks specific details that would genuinely appeal to someone in my demographic, making me question its credibility.
4. **Attractive (Score: 5)** - It's visually appealing but not enough to spark strong interest due to lifestyle and financial constraints.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; I prioritize products with clear, practical benefits that align better with my budget and needs.
2. **Try to buy (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards Disagree; given the current income limitations (<15,000,000 VND) and lack of urgency from the ad's message, I’m unlikely to actively seek out this product.
3. **Consider buying (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree but not highly; under specific circumstances where energy or appearance enhancements could justify the expense, there might be a consideration, though minimal.

Overall, while the ad is moderately engaging visually and somewhat interesting, it doesn't sufficiently address my practical needs nor align with my current financial situation to drive strong purchase intent. Thus, the scores reflect guarded neutrality leaning towards skepticism rather than enthusiasm.
