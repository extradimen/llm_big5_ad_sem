**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3)**: The ad appeals to me somewhat due to its focus on energy and appearance, which are relevant concerns for maintaining a balanced lifestyle.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It's moderately engaging but lacks specific details or compelling evidence about how it works.
   - **Good (5)**: While not groundbreaking, the message is clear—helping with daily performance and looks—which aligns with general wellness goals.
   - **Attractive (4)**: The overall visual appeal and messaging are slightly attractive to me, but it doesn't strongly resonate given my reserved nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2)**: Given the neutral sociability and a cautious outlook influenced by my "strongly agree" for thorough work, I don’t have an immediate intent to buy.
   - **Try (3)**: There is some curiosity due to its claims of energy boost and improved appearance. However, direct experience or peer recommendations would be needed before trying it out.
   - **Consider (3)**: The moderate attractiveness and relevance make me open to considering the product when I have more information or if others in my social circle endorse it.

In summary, while the ad is moderately appealing and useful for staying energized and looking good, personal reservations about its claims and a preference for thorough research before purchasing lead to cautious intentions. Hence, the scores reflect balanced consideration rather than strong commitment.
