**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**
  - **Like the Ad (score 3):** While I acknowledge its existence, it doesn't particularly resonate with my preferences or needs.
  - **Interesting:** The claim about feeling tired and dull is not compelling enough to find the ad engaging (score 2).
  - **Good Quality:** The message seems basic and somewhat overused in marketing; hence, I rate this as neutral-to-mildly positive (score 4).
  - **Attractive:** The visual or emotional appeal of the ad isn't strong for me. This part feels generic rather than attractive (score 1).

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (score 3):** While I'm aware such products exist, my current needs and budget donâ€™t drive a solid intention.
  - **Try to Buy:** Slight curiosity but not enough motivation to actively seek out or purchase the drink (score 2).
  - **Consider Buying:** There's some consideration due to awareness, yet it won't be a priority in the near future (score 2).

Overall, while I recognize its purpose, neither the ad nor the product aligns strongly with my lifestyle and priorities. Thus, both attitude scores and purchase intentions remain moderate-to-low on this scale.
