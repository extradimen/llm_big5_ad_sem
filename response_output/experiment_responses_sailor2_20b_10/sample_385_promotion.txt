**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral; given my preference for practicality and minimalism over marketing fluff.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):**
   - Slightly agree; it addresses staying energized, which might resonate with a busy blue-collar worker's daily challenges.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 2):**
   - Disagree; lacks specific details and credibility for health benefits, making me skeptical.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 5):**
   - Somewhat agree; visually appealing can attract attention, but not enough to fully engage due to underlying skepticism about promises without evidence.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):**
   - Strongly disagree; financial constraints and lack of trust in marketing claims prevent a serious intent.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral; might consider sampling if price is low enough, but not actively seeking it out.

3. **I will consider buying the product (Score = 2):**
   - Slightly disagree; despite some appeal, overall skepticism and limited budget mean I'm unlikely to prioritize this purchase over more essential needs.

**Summary:**
While there are elements of interest in the ad, its perceived lack of credibility and relevance amidst my practical lifestyle lead to a moderate but generally negative attitude. Purchase intention remains low due to financial constraints and trust issues with the promise "look your best." A potential trial might occur under specific conditions (e.g., discounts), but regular purchase is unlikely.
