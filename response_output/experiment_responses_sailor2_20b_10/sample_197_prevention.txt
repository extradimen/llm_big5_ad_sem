**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral; While I acknowledge its attempt to highlight potential consequences of not using the drink, it doesn't strongly resonate emotionally.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2)** - Disagree slightly; The message feels quite generic and lacks originality or a compelling hook for my taste.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - Slightly Agree; It effectively communicates its core message but could benefit from stronger emotional appeal or more engaging visuals.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Neutral; The presentation doesn't captivate me enough to feel particularly drawn in.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Somewhat Disagree; Despite acknowledging its value, my low monthly income makes a premium drink less of a priority.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly Disagree; Financial constraints and competing needs make it unlikely for me to actively seek out or test the product.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Mild Consideration; While I don't dismiss it entirely, other priorities take precedence in my budget planning.

Overall, though the ad is serviceable in its communication, personal factors like financial constraints and a preference for more engaging marketing impact both my attitude towards it and willingness to purchase. Thus, **low scores reflect practical considerations rather than inherent dislike**.
