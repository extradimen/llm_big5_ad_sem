   - **Interesting (Score: 5):** It's engaging because it addresses common daily issues but could be more creative to captivate interest further.
   - **Good (Score: 6):** Overall, the ad seems informative and relevant. The language is clear; however, there’s room for improvement in emotional appeal.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3):** While functional, it lacks a compelling visual or emotional hook to be truly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):** The ad's effectiveness is moderate; I may not rush out to buy the drink.
   - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 3):** There’s a mild inclination based on perceived benefits, but other factors would influence an actual decision.
