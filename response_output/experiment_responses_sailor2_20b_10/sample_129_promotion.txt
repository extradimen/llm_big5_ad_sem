**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
    - I like the ad (Score: 3): While it doesn't evoke strong positive feelings due to its generic nature and overused claims.
    - The ad is interesting (Score: 4): It's mildly engaging but nothing exceptional or captivating for my preferences.
    - Believe the ad is good (Score: 3.5): Neutral leaning slightly negative; I find the benefits claimed too general without specifics.
    - Find it attractive (Score: 2.5): The visual and message lack appeal given my reserved nature and preference for substance over hype.

- **Purchase intention:**
    - Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1): Strongly disagree – Even with a high income, I'm not inclined due to the ad's lack of credibility.
    - Will try to buy it (Score: 2): Slightly reluctant; might be open if available elsewhere but wouldn't seek out based on this promotion alone.
    - Consider buying it (Score: 3): Neutral leaning towards cautious consideration. While I'm a student with financial stability, the product’s efficacy remains doubtful from this ad.

In summary, while not outright dismissive of the idea, my reserved nature and critical mindset prevent strong engagement or immediate purchase intent based on this advertisement alone. More focused, specific information would be necessary to sway me.
