**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude towards the Advertisement:**
   - *Like*: My reserved nature and tendency not to be drawn to talkative or outgoing themes means it's Neutral, but slightly leans positive given its functional benefits (2).
   - *Interesting*: The ad seems straightforward rather than engaging due to my preference for less lively content; thus, Disagree (3).
   - *Good*: Practical benefits align with a helpful outlook; I find the message credible and beneficial—Agree (4). 
   - *Attractive*: While not overtly appealing, it holds some value, leaning Neutral towards Agree but still Disagree considering my cautious nature (3).

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: My careful approach means I'm unlikely to make a spontaneous purchase—Disagree (2).
   - *Try to Buy*: Open to the idea with neutral consideration given its claims, Neutral leaning towards Agree (3).
   - *Consider Buying*: The practical benefits align well with my needs and reservations; thus, agreeable enough for cautious contemplation—Agree (4).

Overall, while not strongly resonant or exciting, it holds a functional appeal that earns modest positive scores. I'm more inclined to consider purchasing due to its utility rather than immediate enthusiasm.
