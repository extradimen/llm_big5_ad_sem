**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (4/7):** While talkative and social aspects of the ad might catch my attention initially, I don't find it particularly appealing. It feels slightly generic.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The promise to stay energized is intriguing for a civil servant's busy lifestyle, but the overall presentation lacks novelty.
   - **Good (6/7):** The message aligns with general wellness needs, making it reasonably well-intentioned and informative. It’s not perfect but serviceable.
   - **Attractive (4/7):** Despite some engagement, my reserved nature means I find it less visually or emotionally engaging.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (3/7):** While the benefits are noteworthy, there isn’t enough compelling evidence for a strong buying intent.
   - **Try to Buy (2/7):** Given occasional rudeness and thoroughness in evaluating products, I might try it once but won't rush into purchasing without more information or reviews.
   - **Consider Buying (1/7):** Low interest due to perceived lack of urgency; the message doesn’t resonate strongly enough for frequent consideration.

In summary, while appreciative of its wellness promise, the ad is not persuasive enough to drive a strong purchase intention given my background and personality traits. My balanced critical evaluation aligns with these moderate-to-low scores.
