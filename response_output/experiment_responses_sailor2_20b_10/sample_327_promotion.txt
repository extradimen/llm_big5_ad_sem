**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score: 2)**: As a reserved individual with low talkativeness and being slightly unsociable, I'm not naturally drawn to promotional ads. The overall tone might seem too upbeat.
  - **Interesting (Score: 3)**: While it covers energy and appearance—important aspects for daily life—it lacks depth or novelty that would genuinely captivate me.
  - **Good (Score: 4)**: The claims of staying energized and looking your best are valid, making the ad reasonable but not compelling enough given my cautious nature regarding health products. 
  - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: It's visually appealing to some extent, but my strong distrust means I'm more critical.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score: 6)**: Despite skepticism, the product seems beneficial for productivity and appearance—key areas where managerial employees like me thrive. However, my tendency towards thoroughness means I would need to research further.
  - **Try (Score: 7)**: Given its potential impact on daily performance, trying it out once satisfies my curiosity driven by both originality and practical benefits.
  - **Consider (Score: 5)**: While not an immediate purchase decision, the idea aligns with managing stress and maintaining efficiency, prompting a serious consideration post-research.

Overall, I find value in the product's promises but need to balance skepticism against its potential usefulness. Thus, moderately positive attitudes lead to intent towards considering or trying it out.
