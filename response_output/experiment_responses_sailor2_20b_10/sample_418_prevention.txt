    - **I like the ad**: Strongly Disagree (1) — Given my reserved nature and occasional rudeness, I don't find it appealing.
    - **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral to Agree (3) — It has a clear message but lacks personal engagement for me.
    - **I believe the ad is good**: Slightly Agree (4) — The straightforward warning can be effective in conveying urgency, though not particularly convincing for my tastes.
    - **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral (3) — While visually and conceptually straightforward, it doesn't resonate emotionally or aesthetically.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1) — The advertisement’s appeal is minimal given my personality traits.
    - **Will try to buy this product**: Slightly Agree (2) — There might be a small inclination due to the fear of looking dull, but overall low motivation.
