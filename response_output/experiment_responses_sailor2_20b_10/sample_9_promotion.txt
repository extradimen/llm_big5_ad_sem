   - The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to my practical side, making it engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: **Score: 5 (Strongly Agree)**
   - It aligns with values like self-care and maintaining a healthy lifestyle which are important for me post-divorce.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: **Score: 4 (Agree)**
   - The visual presentation, if appealing, can make it stand out; however, the overall message resonates positively enough to draw attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: **Score: 2 (Disagree)**
   - Despite liking its benefits, my current budget constraints and monthly income ($26M–$35M VND) make immediate purchases less feasible.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: **Score: 3 (Neutral)**
   - While the ad is appealing, I need further incentives or offers that align with my financial situation before considering a purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: **Score: 4 (Agree)**
   - The benefits are clear and valuable to me; hence, if budget allows or there's an opportunity for discounts/specials, the decision shifts towards affirmative consideration. 

In summary, while I appreciate and find value in the ad’s message, practical constraints and cautious spending habits affect my immediate purchase intent but leave room for future interest under favorable conditions.
