**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Ad Attitude Evaluation**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (5)  
   - As someone who values practicality over superficial claims, I find it neutral because while staying energized is appealing, the emphasis on "looking your best" feels somewhat generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (4)  
   - The messaging lacks novelty for me; energy drinks are saturated in marketing and don't hold much intrigue.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Disagree (3)
   - Without specific, credible evidence or unique selling points beyond typical claims, it feels like a rehashed advertisement that doesn’t stand out.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2)  
   - Given my tendency towards thoroughness and skepticism about general wellness products without clear benefits, I don't see this as visually or conceptually appealing.

### **Purchase Intention Evaluation**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Based on my personality traits of carefulness and critical thinking, there’s little motivation from this ad alone. Specific features/benefits tailored to my lifestyle would be needed.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree (2)  
   - Without compelling evidence or a genuine need highlighted by the ad, trying it out feels unnecessary.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree (2)
   - While not entirely ruling it out, my current mindset doesn’t incline towards considering such products due to insufficient engagement from the advertisement and personal reservations about quick fixes in wellness.

Overall, though I might be open-minded, this ad fails to resonate strongly with me personally or trigger a significant purchase intent. Specific, credible information tailored for an audience like mine would likely fare better.
