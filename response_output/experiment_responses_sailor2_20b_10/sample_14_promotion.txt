**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
    - *I like the ad.* (4): While I appreciate energetic and confidence-building messages, it doesn't fully resonate with me given my reserved nature.
    - *I think the ad is interesting.* (5): The promise of energy and looking good can be engaging but not overly compelling for someone who's generally emotionally stable and cautious about marketing hype.
    - *I believe the ad is good.* (6): It’s well-executed, emphasizing benefits that appeal to a broad audience; however, it lacks personal connection given my personality traits.
    - *I find the ad attractive.* (3): The visual aspects might be appealing, but it doesn't align closely with my values or lifestyle choices.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - *I intend to purchase this product.* (2): Despite liking some elements of the message, I'm not strongly motivated due to my practical mindset and careful spending habits.
    - *I will try to buy this product.* (1): Low inclination since it feels less relevant considering my priorities as a blue-collar worker focused on efficacy over aesthetics.
    - *I will consider buying this product.* (2): There’s some level of openness to evaluation, but I would need more specific details or incentives aligned with personal values before making the decision.

In summary, while acknowledging the ad's good production and positive messaging, my reserved nature, practical approach, and cautious attitude result in moderate interest without strong purchase intent.
