**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like the ad**: 4 (Agree)
   - Despite being generally reserved and sometimes rude, the advertisement's clear messaging resonates on a practical level but doesn't captivate me strongly due to my cautious nature.
   
2. **Interesting**: 5 (Strongly Agree)
   - The idea of avoiding fatigue and maintaining vitality is appealing, especially in fast-paced Southeast Asian work culture; thus, it holds interest.

3. **Good ad**: 3 (Neutral)
   - The message about preventing tiredness is valid but doesn't convince me entirely without stronger evidence or personal relevance.
   
4. **Attractive**: 2 (Disagree)
   - While the concept of looking fresh and energetic is desirable, my reserved personality tends to view marketing promises with skepticism.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase**: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my strong agreement on thoroughness and careful planning but lackluster attraction toward this ad, I am unlikely to impulsively buy it.
   
2. **Try to buy**: 2 (Disagree)
   - A slight curiosity piqued by the interesting angle doesn't translate into a high likelihood of trying; practical concerns weigh more.

3. **Consider buying**: 3 (Neutral/Consider)
   - The potential benefits are worth considering, particularly if thereâ€™s additional information or personal endorsement that aligns with my cautious yet helpful nature.

In summary, while I acknowledge the value proposition and find parts of the ad engaging, it falls short on immediate appeal due to a mix of reserved skepticism and practicality. As an office worker, I'm open but not compelled by this advertisement alone. A more comprehensive approach or additional reassurance might sway me further towards purchase intention.
