**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **Like (score = 3):** While the message of energy and looking your best is appealing in principle, it feels somewhat generic.
  - **Interesting (score = 4):** The promise resonates with common desires but lacks novelty for me; thus, it's moderately interesting.
  - **Good (score = 2):** I appreciate being energized, but the ad appears more focused on aesthetics than health or utility.
  - **Attractive (score = 5):** Thereâ€™s an attractive element in staying refreshed and looking good daily, yet not compelling enough to sway my reservations.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (score = 1):** Given the neutral-to-distrustful approach towards marketing claims due to being Strongly Agree in terms of "I worry a lot" combined with financial concerns, I'm unlikely to intend buying it.
  - **Try (score = 2):** Though mildly curious about its effectiveness, my natural caution and skepticism keep me from trying immediately.
  - **Consider (score = 3):** The product might be on my radar for future consideration if personal circumstances or additional trust-building information arises.

Overall, while the ad appeals to common wellness aspirations, it doesn't deeply resonate with my cautious nature and specific needs. Thus, a moderate-to-low intention aligns best with this evaluation.
