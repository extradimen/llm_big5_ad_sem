**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (3/7)**: The ad is somewhat engaging but doesn’t strongly resonate with my reserved nature.
  - **Interesting (4/7)**: It’s moderately interesting due to its direct message about fatigue and appearance, though it lacks emotional depth for me personally.
  - **Good (2/7)**: I find the claim credible, but there's no strong personal appeal or unique value proposition that excites me.
  - **Attractive (5/7)**: The idea of avoiding tiredness is somewhat attractive, even if my natural skepticism means it doesn’t captivate.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (1/7)**: I have no immediate intention because the ad's call-to-action seems generic and not compelling enough.
  - **Try to Buy (3/7)**: It nudges me slightly but does not inspire a trial purchase due to other brand familiarity or preferences.
  - **Consider Buying (2/7)**: While it prompts some thought, my cautious nature makes serious consideration low; I need more information and personal relevance.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in its messaging, it doesn’t align well with my reserved, unimpressed demeanor nor sufficiently drive a strong purchase motivation.
