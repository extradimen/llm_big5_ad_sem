**Evaluation Details:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 2)  
   Disagree due to my reserved and somewhat skeptical nature; I don't typically warm up quickly to promotional content.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3)  
   Neutral—while it doesn’t captivate me, its simplicity in conveying energy benefits can be mildly engaging for someone seeking an uplifted lifestyle.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4)  
   Agree; even if I don't find it compelling personally, it presents a clear message of health and vitality which has general merit.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3)  
   Neutral leaning toward slightly agreeable—visual elements might be well-crafted but lack enough emotional resonance for me to feel drawn in deeply.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1)
   Strongly Disagree; given my financial situation and cautious nature, the cost may seem prohibitive without a strong personal incentive or significant need.

2. **Will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)  
   Strongly Disagree—lacking immediate interest in energy drinks coupled with perceived overcommitment on finances makes it unlikely I'll make an effort to purchase one.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1)
   Strongly Disagree; despite understanding the benefits, my current priorities and lifestyle don’t align with frequent or necessary consumption of such products, making consideration minimal.

Overall, while appreciating its positive messaging, the advertisement doesn't drive a strong enough connection to influence my purchasing behavior under these circumstances. The balance between skepticism and personal needs tilts against engaging further.
