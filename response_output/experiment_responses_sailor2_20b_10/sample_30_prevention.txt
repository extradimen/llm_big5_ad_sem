**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad (score=2):** The message seems somewhat generic and doesn't resonate strongly with my reserved nature. It feels a bit overpromised.
    - **Interesting (score=3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it's not very compelling but gets the point across without being overly flashy or engaging for me.
    - **Good (score=4):** While not exceptional, the ad delivers its message clearly and doesn't seem misleading. It earns a moderate approval.
    - **Attractive (score=3):** The visual aspect is average; it lacks emotional appeal given my reserved personality.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score=1):** I strongly disagree because the ad doesn’t create urgency or personal relevance for me, considering my daily routine and financial constraints.
    - **Try to buy this product (score=2):** Slightly more neutral leaning towards a small inclination; if it were on sale with discounts, I might give it a try out of curiosity.
    - **Consider buying the product (score=2):** Minimal consideration due to my limited budget and other priorities. The appeal is weak enough that purchase isn't high on my list.

In summary, while understanding its intention to prevent tiredness and dull appearances, the ad falls short in persuading someone like me with a reserved personality and constrained financial situation. It lacks emotional engagement and practical relevance within my lifestyle. Hence, it doesn’t lead to strong purchase intent despite minor curiosity-driven consideration.
