**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **I like the ad (score=3):** While I appreciate its message about preventing fatigue and dullness, it doesn't resonate strongly with me.
   - **Interesting:** The concept of feeling tired without the drink is engaging (score=4).
   - **Good:** It effectively communicates a clear benefit but feels somewhat typical in its delivery (score=5).
   - **Attractive:** Despite the appealing message, my reserved nature and general skepticism reduce its attractiveness (score=2).

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score=3):** There's moderate consideration due to personal experience with fatigue but no strong drive.
   - **Try to buy this product (score=3):** Curiosity and the potential benefit encourage a trial, though not an immediate commitment.
   - **Consider buying this product (score=4):** It stays in my mind as something worth trying once I have more time or need for its claimed effects.

Overall, while there's some interest driven by personal needs and logical appeal, the ad does not create strong emotional engagement nor prompt a definite purchase decision. The balance of skepticism and practical consideration results in moderate scores across both attitude and intention metrics.
