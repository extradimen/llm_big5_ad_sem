**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward Advertisement**
  - **Like the Ad:** Neutral (score = 2) — As a reserved individual with limited talkativeness, I find the ad engaging but not overwhelmingly appealing.
  - **Interesting:** Slightly Agree (score = 3) — The promise of energy and looking good is relatable for daily life, but it doesn't immediately capture my full attention.
  - **Good Advertisement:** Agree (score = 4) — It seems well-designed and relevant to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, though not exceptional.
  - **Attractive:** Slightly Agree (score = 3) — The visuals may be appealing, but the messaging feels slightly generic.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (score = 1) — Given my monthly income constraints and practical needs, I prioritize essential goods over luxury drinks.
  - **Try to Buy:** Disagree (score = 2) — The ad is not compelling enough for me to actively seek out this product despite its benefits.
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (score = 3) — While it’s worth considering if there's a sale or special offer, routine purchases are unlikely due to budget limitations and other priorities.

Overall, the advertisement resonates somewhat but falls short of driving strong intent to purchase for someone like me—practical, reserved, with specific financial constraints.
