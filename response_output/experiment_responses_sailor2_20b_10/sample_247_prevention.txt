**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (5) – The statement is straightforward but lacks a compelling emotional connection.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly Disagree (4) – While it has a clear message, it doesn't spark much interest for me personally.
   - **Good:** Somewhat Agree (3) – It’s informative and truthful about the product's potential effects.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – The appeal is minimal; more creative visuals or emotional resonance would improve attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral/Consideration (3) – While I understand its benefits, it hasn't convinced me enough for a strong intent.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** Somewhat Agree (3.5) – Curiosity is piqued but not high enough to drive immediate action.
   - **Will consider buying the product:** Moderate Consideration (2.5) – I am open to giving it a chance, especially if offered during sales or reviews.

Overall, while acknowledging its utility and honesty, this ad falls short in capturing my enthusiasm due to lack of emotional engagement and compelling visual appeal. It still holds some value but doesn’t push me toward an immediate purchase decision. Further enhancements could elevate both attraction and intent scores.
