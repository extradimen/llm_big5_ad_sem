**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*  
   Given my reserved nature, I don't find flashy advertisements appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)*  
   The concept of staying energized and looking good seems generic but not particularly engaging for someone who prefers more substance over hype.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 4 (Slightly Agree)*  
   While it aims to convey positive benefits, I'm skeptical about its credibility without specific details or proof.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)*  
   As an introverted and reserved individual, the energy-driven visuals may feel overwhelming rather than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*  
   Despite its claims, I'm not inclined due to my cautious nature and lack of immediate need for such a drink in my daily routine.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*  
   The absence of compelling evidence or personal relevance makes me unlikely to make an effort to purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)**  
   While not actively dismissing it, I am neither highly motivated nor skeptical enough to dismiss out-of-hand; it might be considered based on further information. 

Overall, the ad fails to resonate with my values and lifestyle preferences, leading to a negative attitude despite acknowledging its potential benefits superficially. My practical nature outweighs any emotional appeal from such promotions.
