**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitudes towards the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3)
   - While I appreciate its focus on energy and appearance, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personality traits—especially as someone who is talkative but not overly sociable or outgoing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 2)
   - The message feels generic; it lacks a unique angle that might interest me personally beyond basic needs of staying energized and looking good, which are common themes in many ads.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4)
   - It's functional and meets its objective to promote benefits clearly but doesn't grab my attention or evoke strong positive feelings due to its predictability and lack of emotional appeal tailored to my background.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3)
   - The visual and message are okay, but they don’t excite me enough given my preference for originality in ideas (Agree) over mundane presentations.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 5)
   - Despite the neutral-to-negative attitudes towards the ad itself, I am open to trying products that promise energy and appearance improvements within a reasonable budget range.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 6)
   - Given my monthly income bracket of 26-35 million VND, it's financially feasible for me to give the drink a trial run based on its promises.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 7)
   - Even though I'm not fully sold by the ad’s presentation, there is enough inherent value in maintaining energy and appearance that aligns with my lifestyle as an office worker needing productivity tools without being overly influenced by flashy marketing tactics.

Overall, while the advertisement itself falls short of impressing me due to its lack of originality and emotional engagement, it presents a practical benefit I might be inclined to explore further through purchase. Therefore, I rate higher in intention but lower in appreciation for how the message was delivered.
