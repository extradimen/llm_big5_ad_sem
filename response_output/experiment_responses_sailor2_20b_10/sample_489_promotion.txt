**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 4 (Neutral to Positive)*  
   Although not strongly positive, the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me due to my Strongly Agree tendency for having an active imagination.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 5 (Somewhat Agree)*  
   The idea resonates with a touch of creativity but doesn't fully excite given its common claims in similar products.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 6 (Agree)**  
   It seems trustworthy on paper, though I remain Neutral to Strongly Disagree regarding trust and thoroughness concerning health/well-being promises.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 3 (Slightly Agree)*   
   The attractiveness factor is moderate; it’s engaging but not overwhelmingly compelling due to my tendency towards skepticism.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 2 (Disagree)*  
   My strong work ethic and cautious nature mean I'm less likely to make impulsive purchases, despite the appeal.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 3 (Neutral)**  
   There’s a neutral inclination; while not dismissive, there's no urgency or high motivation.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 5 (Somewhat Agree)*   
   Given the balanced scores from attitude and realistic expectations of its benefits, I'm open to considering it when evaluating similar options.

This evaluation reflects a thoughtful balance between interest and skepticism characteristic for someone with my demographic profile and personality traits. While not overly impressed by the ad, there's room for consideration under appropriate circumstances.
