**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores (7-Point Scale)**

1. **Like the Ad:** Score = **3**
   - While I appreciate its energy claims and visual appeal, it doesn't strongly connect with my values or daily lifestyle.
  
2. **Interesting Ad:** Score = **2** 
   - The promise of looking best every day feels cliché to me; more innovative messaging would be compelling.

3. **Good Advertisement:** Score = **3**
   - Functionally okay but lacks depth and originality, missing the strong emotional or practical hook needed for a standout ad.
  
4. **Attractive Ad:** Score = **4** 
   - Visually pleasing to an extent, but it doesn’t fully capture my attention due to its generic nature.

### **Purchase Intention Scores (7-Point Scale)**

1. **Intend to Purchase:**
   - **Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)**
     - Despite the energy boost claim, I prioritize healthier natural options over a potentially high-sugar or artificial product.
  
2. **Will Try to Buy:** 
   - **Score = 2**   
     - There’s no immediate motivation; however, if it were widely recommended by trusted sources, curiosity might prompt me to give it a try.

3. **Consider Buying:**
   - **Score = 2 (Neutral)**    
     - I'm open-minded but won't actively seek this product out. Additional benefits or endorsements could sway my consideration further down the line.

Overall, while the ad has some visual appeal and energy relevance, its generic messaging doesn’t resonate deeply enough to drive a strong purchase intent for me based on personal values, health concerns, and current preferences.
