**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** 
   - *Score: 4*
   - Neutral to positive; While I appreciate its energy boost promise, my reserved nature and sometimes critical eye keep me from fully liking it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:**
   - *Score: 3.5* (Agree)
   - Itâ€™s somewhat engaging due to its focus on daily appearance enhancement but doesn't stand out enough for strong interest given personal preferences.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**
   - *Score: 3.5*
   - The message appears credible, promising energy and a positive self-image, though my practical nature slightly diminishes complete belief without tangible proof.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** 
   - *Score: 2.5* (Disagree)
   - My reserved personality finds it less appealing; I prioritize substance over surface-level attractiveness in product claims.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**
   - *Score: 1*
   - Strongly Disagree
   - Given my current financial constraints (26-35 million VND monthly income), prioritizing basic needs over a potentially non-essential drink seems prudent.

2. **I will try to buy this product:**
   - *Score: 2* (Disagree)
   - While the idea of staying energized is appealing, budget limitations and cautious nature make me unlikely to pursue trying it without further assurances or significant discount incentives.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**
   - *Score: 2*
   - Disagree
   - Despite some positive aspects, my generally thorough approach means I need more data on benefits, cost-effectiveness, and reliability before considering a purchase.

Overall, while the ad is moderately well-received in terms of presentation, it falls short of compelling me to prioritize its product given my lifestyle, budget constraints, and personal values. Emphasizing practicality over allure would likely improve both attitude scores and purchase intent for someone like myself.
