**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    1. *I like the ad.* (Score: 2) - Given my reserved nature and tendency towards skepticism, I don't find it compelling.
    2. *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 3) - Neutral to slightly agree; promises energy and looking good can interest me but not strongly.
    3. *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 4) - Slightly agree due to general trust issues, it's decent enough but I need more proof.
    4. *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 5) - Neutral leaning towards slightly attractive; visuals and messaging could be better.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
    1. *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree because of budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month).
    2. *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1) - Similarly, not inclined due to financial limitations and lack of strong motivation.
    3. *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2) - Somewhat agree; if there's a compelling deal or need arises in the future, I might reconsider.

In summary, while the ad captures attention moderately well for its claims, my personal traits, financial situation, and cautious approach to purchases mean it won't lead me directly towards buying. The potential is there but heavily depends on other factors like price promotions or necessity.
