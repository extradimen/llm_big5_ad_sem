**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score = 3):** Given my preference for being thorough but not overly talkative or outgoing, I find it moderately appealing without overwhelming me.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** It grabs attention with its promise of energy and looking good daily, which resonates slightly, especially as a blue-collar worker needing stamina.
   - **Good (score = 5):** The message is straightforward and has potential benefits, making it feel credible but not necessarily compelling enough to strongly endorse.
   - **Attractive (score = 4):** It's visually appealing and relevant, though my practical mindset keeps the attraction level moderate.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (score = 2):** The ad is persuasive yet does not trigger an immediate purchase intention due to limited budget constraints.
   - **Try (score = 3):** I might give it a try if offered at an affordable price, considering the benefits could be useful in my daily life.
   - **Consider (score = 4):** Despite some skepticism about long-term efficacy, the idea of improved energy and appearance aligns enough with personal needs to warrant consideration.

Overall, while appreciating its message, practical considerations—especially financial limitations—affect both engagement and intent towards purchase. Thus, moderate scores reflect a balanced outlook.
