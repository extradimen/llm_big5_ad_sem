**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Ad Type: Prevention):**
  - I like the ad (`2`): Neutral leaning toward slight dislike. The general tone feels a bit overbearing for someone who values trust and emotional stability.
  - It's interesting (`3`): Slightly agree; it has some appeal but doesn't capture my attention strongly due to personal preference towards more straightforward messaging.
  - I believe the ad is good (`4`): Neutral leaning toward agreement. While well-crafted, it lacks strong resonance with my reserved nature and cautious outlook on health claims.
  - It's attractive (`1`): Strongly disagree; the urgency implied feels manipulative for a blue-collar worker who prefers practicality over dramatized warnings.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (`2`): Disagree. The ad isn't persuasive enough given my neutral-to-negative attitude and preference for reliable information.
  - I will try to buy this product (`2`): Neutral leaning toward not trying; hesitation due to the lack of compelling evidence or personal need highlighted in the ad.
  - Consider buying it (`1`): Disagree; while some aspects may resonate with needing a boost, my generally skeptical nature and stable emotional state make me less inclined to act on this advertisement.

Overall, while I appreciate straightforward messaging for health products, this particular ad falls short of convincing someone like me due to its dramatic tone, lack of credible evidence, and personal preferences.
