**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad. (3)**: While talkative and social aspects are important to me, I am generally reserved which makes me less inclined to emotionally connect with flashy ads.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (4)**: The promise of staying energized resonates moderately but not strongly enough given my daily struggles in a blue-collar job that's physically demanding yet routine.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (5)**: It seems to address common needs for energy and appearance, making it somewhat believable, though I remain cautious due to past experiences with exaggerated claims.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (2)**: The attractiveness of the messaging falls short as my primary concern isn't aesthetics but reliability in real-world performance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (1)**: Despite understanding its benefits, my limited budget (<15,000,000 VND) and cautious nature make me highly unlikely to commit.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (2)**: There's a slight interest in giving it a shot if the price is reasonable and I have an occasion where energy boost might be crucial.
  - **Consider buying this product. (3)**: Even with my worrying tendencies, I am open to considering it under specific circumstances or when thereâ€™s more reliable information about its effectiveness.

In summary, while somewhat favorable in aspects of belief and interest, practical constraints and personal reservations prevent a strong commitment towards purchasing the advertised drink.
