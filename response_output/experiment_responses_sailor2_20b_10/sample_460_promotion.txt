**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 2* - The "talkative" trait makes you generally open to information, but the emphasis on appearance (looking your best) feels somewhat irrelevant given my focus on everyday work efficiency rather than vanity.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 3* - Neutral leaning slightly positive; it does catch attention due to energy benefits needed for daily tasks, yet the overall presentation doesn't resonate deeply with personal interests or needs.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 4* - Slightly above neutral. While I acknowledge its potential utility in boosting stamina, there are more practical work-related products I value higher given my job nature and income constraints.

4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - The overly glossy presentation feels out of sync with your blue-collar lifestyle. Practicality over aesthetics is crucial; thus, it lacks attractiveness for you.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 2* - Mild intention due to the potential energy benefits but not a priority given existing budget and less urgency compared to more essential items.

2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 2* - Slightly higher than neutral; curiosity about how it might improve daily work output is there, yet hesitant without strong personal relevance or immediate need.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 2* - Generally open-minded and planning-oriented (Strongly Agree), but the balance between cost vs. perceived benefit tilts slightly towards considering rather than committing.

In summary, while you find aspects of the ad engaging to a degree, practical concerns about relevance and budget take precedence over an impulse purchase decision. Thus, your attitudes remain moderately positive yet not compelling enough for strong intent or urgency in buying this product.
