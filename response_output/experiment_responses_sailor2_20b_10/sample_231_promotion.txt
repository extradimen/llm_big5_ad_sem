**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude**: 

  - **Like (Score: 3)**: While the ad's premise is engaging, its overall appeal falls short for me. I appreciate energy and appearance enhancement claims but lack strong emotional connection.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: The promise of staying energized does intrigue me as it aligns with my lifestyle needs, making the message somewhat intriguing.
  - **Good (Score: 2)**: Credibility feels average; specific evidence or testimonials would improve its perception. It lacks strong brand backing for full confidence.
  - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: The presentation is acceptable but not compelling enough given my personality traits and financial constraints.

- **Purchase Intention**:

  - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1). Despite being interested, I'm hesitant due to budget limitations (<15,000,000 VND monthly income) and the absence of clear value propositions.
  - **Try to Buy**: Somewhat Agree (2). Given its moderate appeal and potential benefits for energy, there's a minor inclination but not enough drive to actually make an effort.
  - **Consider Buying**: Neutral (2). While it remains in my consideration set, other factors such as price, convenience, and necessity will heavily influence any future decision.

In summary, the ad has some merit but falls short on emotional resonance, credibility, and practical affordability for me. Consequently, though I am marginally interested, purchase intent is low due to financial constraints and mixed feelings about its effectiveness.
