**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - *I like the ad (score 4):* Neutral but slightly positive. The claim of fatigue and dullness resonates somewhat, especially considering daily stress.
  - *Interesting:* Slightly agreeable at a score of 3 due to its relevance during hectic times.
  - *Believe it’s good:* Score 4 reflects some credulity; the preventive aspect feels reasonable but not groundbreaking.
  - *Attractive:* A lower score (2) as the ad's tone is somewhat cliché and lacks emotional depth.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (score 2):* Neutral leaning towards disinterest. The connection between fatigue and looks isn't strong enough.
  - *Will try to buy:* Similar reluctance, so a score of 2 reflects cautiousness rather than enthusiasm.
  - *Consider buying it (score 3):* Slightly higher due to the awareness that occasional fatigue is common; still on the fence.

**Summary:**
While acknowledging some validity in its message, my overall attitude towards this ad leans towards neutrality with hints of skepticism. My purchase intention remains low without a compelling personal need or unique selling proposition that stands out for me as an informed consumer balancing responsibility and self-care.
