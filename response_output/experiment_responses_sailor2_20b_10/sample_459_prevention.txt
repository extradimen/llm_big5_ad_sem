**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 5)** - While it's neutral and informative, I don't find it overly engaging or exciting.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The concept of feeling tired without the drink is clear but not particularly novel.
3. **Believe the ad is good (Score: 3)** - It effectively communicates a potential benefit but lacks emotional depth and creativity.
4. **Find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - I don't find it visually or emotionally appealing enough to draw me in strongly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; although the message is clear, there are many other options available.
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Also strongly disagree; it doesn't persuade me enough based on my current needs and routine.
3. **Will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral but leaning towards considering; if I were in a situation where fatigue is an issue, it might be worth trying once.

In summary, the ad delivers its message clearly but falls short of compelling me due to lackluster presentation and my current state of satisfaction with alternatives. However, there's a low possibility for future consideration based on context-specific needs.
