   - *Like*: Neutral leaning towards positive because I appreciate its message without being overly enthusiastic.
   - *Interesting*: Slightly below neutral as the concept is common but not groundbreaking.
   - *Good*: Agree, finding it well-crafted and effective in conveying benefits.
   - *Attractive*: Moderately attractive, appealing to my values of staying energized and looking good.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Likely due to its alignment with daily needs (energy boost).
   - *Try to Buy*: Cautious but motivated by the product's claimed benefits.
