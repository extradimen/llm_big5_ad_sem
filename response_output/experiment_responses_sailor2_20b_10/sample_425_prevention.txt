**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (2/7):** While not strongly positive, the ad resonates with my desire for energy and appearance improvements but falls short in engaging me deeply due to slight skepticism about its claims.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The concept is intriguing enough given my tendency towards originality, though it doesn't captivate entirely because of neutral imagination traits.
   - **Good (4/7):** I appreciate the message’s focus on preventing tiredness and dull appearance; however, some skepticism about effectiveness keeps me from fully endorsing it as "good".
   - **Attractive (5/7):** The ad is generally appealing in its presentation but doesn't completely align with my highly sociable nature or alleviate immediate concerns.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (6/7):** Given that the product targets issues like fatigue and appearance, which are important for a busy manager, I have a strong inclination to try it.
   - **Will Try to Buy (7/7):** My commitment to following through on plans means I will make an effort to purchase based on this ad's persuasive elements.
   - **Consider Buying (6/7):** Despite my critical nature and some reservations about efficacy, the benefits suggested are compelling enough for serious consideration.

Overall, while the advertisement doesn’t score extremely high in attitude due to mild skepticism, it strongly influences my intent to consider and potentially purchase the product. The alignment with personal goals around energy levels and appearance drives a favorable yet cautious response.
