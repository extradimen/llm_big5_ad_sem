**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 3)
   - While I appreciate its intention to highlight potential drawbacks without the drink, it doesn't resonate strongly due to my practical nature.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4)
   - It's engaging in terms of addressing common feelings and appearances but lacks novelty for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5)
   - The message is clear, but it feels somewhat generic; its effectiveness lies more in simplicity than originality.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)
   - Personally, I'm not drawn to overly alarmist messaging even if factual.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2)
   - There's no strong impulse despite recognizing its value; other factors like price and necessity will play a larger role.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)
   - I might give it a chance if the opportunity arises, but not actively seeking out.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3)
   - It falls within my consideration set when evaluating options for energy and appearance enhancement without compelling me immediately to make a purchase decision. 

In summary, while the ad is effective in raising awareness about its benefits, it doesn't strongly compel me due to my preference for practicality over dramatic appeals. My willingness to consider buying aligns with cautious but open-minded evaluation rather than immediate action.
