**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**:  
  - **Like (4)**: Neutral to mildly positive. The catchphrase seems okay but doesn't excite me.
  - **Interesting (3)**: Slightly interesting due to its focus on energy and appearance, though not groundbreaking.
  - **Good (5)**: Generally acceptable; it claims benefits relevant for daily life but isn’t compelling enough.
  - **Attractive (2)**: Not particularly appealing—lacks a unique angle or emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - **Intend to Purchase (3)**: Neutral leaning toward “not likely.” The ad doesn't push me to make an immediate purchase decision.
  - **Will Try to Buy (2)**: Minimal intent. No strong motivation to give it a try since other options might be considered first.
  - **Consider Buying (1)**: Low consideration; while the product benefits are noted, there isn’t enough persuasion for serious contemplation.

Overall, I find the ad to be mildly positive but not strongly compelling given my reserved nature and tendency towards practical decisions. The lack of emotional engagement or standout features reduces its appeal significantly in terms of both attitude and purchase intention.
