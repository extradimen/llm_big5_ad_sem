**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Type = Prevention):**
   - *Like:* Given my strong talkativeness and sociability concerns (Disagree), I find it somewhat agreeable but not strongly appealing (`2`).
   - *Interesting:* The ad effectively taps into common feelings of fatigue, making it relevant to daily experiences (`3`). However, its simplicity might lack the depth needed for full engagement.
   - *Good:* While it conveys a clear message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it lacks creativity or emotional resonance (`4`).
   - *Attractive:* The straightforward appeal is somewhat attractive but falls short in visual intrigue or emotional connection (`5`). 

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* Despite mixed feelings on the ad itself, its practical message resonates with my diligent and plan-oriented nature (Strongly Agree), motivating me to consider purchasing it (`6`).
   - *Try to Buy:* The clear benefits of staying energized align well with my goal-driven personality, pushing towards a trial purchase (`7`).
   - *Consider Buying:* Given the credible presentation of potential outcomes (avoiding tiredness and dull appearance) combined with trust in product claims (Strongly Agree), I will definitely include it in future shopping decisions (`7`). 

Overall, while the ad's execution isn't perfect for me personally, its practicality and alignment with health-conscious goals drive strong purchase consideration.
