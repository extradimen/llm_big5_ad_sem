**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards positive (score = 5)
   - Given my sociability and preference for new ideas, I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, but it’s not overly compelling.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Agree (score = 6)
   - The unique angle appeals to my desire for originality, making me see potential benefits.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral leaning towards positive (score = 4)
   - While I appreciate its messaging, it falls short in thoroughly convincing me about tangible results or long-term effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly negative (score = 3)
   - It's not visually or emotionally engaging enough for a strong personal appeal; more detail might help build confidence.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards low intention (score = 2)
   - Despite the message resonating moderately, I don’t feel an immediate need due to my existing routines and skepticism about quick fixes.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Low intent (score = 2)
   - The lack of a strong emotional connection or urgent incentive makes trying it less likely without further assurance or reviews from trusted sources.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral but inclined to consideration (score = 3)
   - The ad sparks interest, so I’m open to exploring more details and perhaps giving the product a chance under favorable circumstances or promotions.

Overall, while there is some intrigue around staying energized and looking good, my cautious nature and thoroughness require additional reassurances before making an actual purchase decision.
