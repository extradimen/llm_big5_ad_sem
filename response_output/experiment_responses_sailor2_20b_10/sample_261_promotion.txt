**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (5/7):** The slogan is catchy and resonates somewhat with my desire for energy but I'm not overly enthusiastic.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** It's mildly intriguing, particularly if marketed appropriately to busy professionals like me, but lacks depth or novelty.
   - **Good (3.5/7):** While it presents a positive message about staying energized and looking good, the claims feel somewhat generic and may not be sufficiently compelling for daily motivation.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** I find aspects of the ad visually appealing, but its overall appeal falls short due to my preference for more substantive content.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (2.5/7):** Although the benefits sound promising, my initial intention is low because the product needs more specific details on efficacy and unique value.
   - **Try (3/7):** There's a moderate interest in trying it to see if it meets its claims, especially since staying energized is important for managing stress.
   - **Consider (4/7):** Given my active lifestyle and job demands, I might consider the product more seriously after reading reviews or experiencing firsthand results. The general messaging aligns somewhat with my needs but requires stronger evidence to secure a purchase decision.

Overall, while there's mild appeal in the ad's promises, it falls short of significantly influencing immediate purchase intent due to generic claims and lack of compelling unique selling points (USPs). Further details and tangible benefits would likely boost these scores.
