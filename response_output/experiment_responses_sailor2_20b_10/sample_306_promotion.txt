**Evaluation Details:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - I like the ad (`4`): Neutral; Though talkative and outgoing, my strong reserve means it doesn't immediately appeal.
   - I think the ad is interesting (`5`): Agree; The energy boost claim piques curiosity despite reservations.
   - I believe the ad is good (`3`): Slightly agree; Credibility feels somewhat lacking given personal tendencies to scrutinize details.
   - I find the ad attractive (`2`): Disagree; My tendency towards carefulness and emotional concerns (worry a lot) make it less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention**
   - I intend to purchase this product (`1`): Strongly disagree; Current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) outweigh perceived benefits.
   - I will try to buy this product (`2`): Disagree; Despite interest in staying energized, the lack of strong attraction and affordability concerns deter me from active pursuit.
   - I will consider buying this product (`3`): Somewhat consider; It's not ruled out entirely but requires more convincing given my cautious nature.

Overall, while intrigued by the promise to stay energized, practical considerations like financial stability, detailed scrutiny, and a balanced perspective lead to moderate interest rather than immediate intent.
