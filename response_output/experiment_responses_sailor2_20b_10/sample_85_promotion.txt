**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like:** Neutral (5) — The ad’s message is clear but doesn't strongly resonate with my preferences.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — It captures attention and seems engaging, especially due to the energy promise.
    - **Good:** Strongly Agree (6) — Promising health benefits appeal to me as someone valuing a thorough job in self-care.
    - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) — The visual or emotional allure isn't compelling enough given my nervous disposition and desire for practicality.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend:** Disagree (2) — While I appreciate the benefits, direct intent to purchase right now is low due to personal budget constraints.
    - **Try:** Agree (4) — There’s a willingness to give it a try, especially if there's a discount or trial offer.
    - **Consider:** Strongly Agree (6) — The product aligns with my goal of staying energized and looking good daily, making me seriously consider future purchase decisions based on convenience and efficacy. 

Overall, the ad is well-received but falls short in immediate attraction due to personal inclinations toward practicality and nervousness, yet remains a strong contender for consideration in the long run.
