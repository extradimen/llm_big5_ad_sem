**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (score=4)** - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; the idea of being energized and looking good appeals to my youthful energy.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score=5)** - Agreeable, as it targets common daily struggles with fatigue and appearance.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score=3)** - Neutral leaning towards skepticism due to a mix of curiosity but also doubt about its effectiveness.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score=2)** - Disagree; while visually appealing, there's not enough personal relevance or trust in the claim.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score=1)** - Strongly disagree; my budget constraints and current consumption habits don't align with this expenditure.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score=1)** - Strongly disagree for similar reasons as above, plus a lack of urgency or compelling need.
3. **I will consider buying it (score=2)** - Neutral leaning towards unlikely; while the concept is appealing, my cautious nature and practical priorities make me less inclined to purchase impulsively.

Overall, I appreciate the ad's message but find it more persuasive in theory than practice due to budgetary limits and personal preferences for other approaches. Thus, a moderate interest without strong intent to buy.
