**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
- **Like (4/7):**
   - Given my reserved nature and tendency to be careful in evaluating things, I find the ad mildly appealing but not strongly so.
  
- **Interesting (5/7):**
   - The concept of staying energized is somewhat interesting, especially for an office worker. However, it lacks depth or novelty that would captivate me entirely.

- **Good (3/7):**
   - While I appreciate the message's intention to promote well-being, there isn't enough compelling evidence or detail to fully convince me about its effectiveness.

- **Attractive (2/7):**
   - The ad's overall presentation feels a bit generic. As someone with an active imagination and artistic interests, it falls short in creativity and design attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase: 1/7 (Strongly Disagree)**
   - Despite the idea being somewhat promising, my strong agreement on thoroughness and cautious approach mean I need more evidence or a compelling reason before considering buying this drink regularly.

- **Will try to buy: 2/7 (Disagree)**
   - A slight increase over "intend," but without personal urgency or trust in the brand's claims, trying it once is not high on my priority list.

- **Consider buying: 3/7 (Neutral)**
   - If offered a promotional deal, free trial, or more substantial information about its benefits, I might consider giving it a try, balancing between curiosity and practicality. 

Overall, while there's mild interest in the concept, the ad falls short on compelling detail, creativity, and trustworthiness for me to be strongly drawn towards purchasing the product.
