**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral because while I appreciate the promise of energy and looking good, it doesn't immediately resonate strongly.
   - **Interesting:** Agree since the benefits appeal to staying active and maintaining appearance—relevant to my daily life.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree due to its clear value proposition, which aligns with both personal well-being goals and professional commitments.
   - **Attractive:** Agree; visually appealing packaging or messaging could further enhance attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Considerable but not strong intent (3). The ad sparks interest but doesn't immediately drive a purchase decision due to budget constraints and preference for thorough research.
   - **Try:** May try, depending on additional information such as pricing, ingredients, health claims, user reviews, etc. (4).
   - **Consider:** Will definitely consider buying if the product provides convincing details about efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and trustworthiness—given my generally trusting nature (5).

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's messaging and find it good for an initial impression, a more comprehensive evaluation of benefits versus costs is necessary before making a purchase decision. My strong helpfulness trait inclines me towards seeking value that positively impacts both personal health and daily performance.
