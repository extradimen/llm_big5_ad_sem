**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like**: Neutral (3) – Although talkative, I don't find it particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4) – The message about feeling tired and looking dull might pique curiosity briefly but doesn’t hold sustained interest for me.
  - **Good**: Disagree (2) – It feels more manipulative than persuasive; the language is too extreme for my taste.
  - **Attractive**: Neutral (3) – There's no strong visual or emotional draw that would attract me.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1) – Even though I acknowledge fatigue, this ad doesn't resonate with how I make buying decisions.
  - **Will Try**: Strongly Disagree (1) – There's no compelling reason or trust in the product from the advertisement itself.
  - **Consider Buying**: Disagree (2) – While theoretically a tired person might use such products, my personal skepticism and lack of immediate need mean I won't consider it seriously.

Overall, while acknowledging its message relevance, my background, traits, and values lead to neutral-to-negative attitudes towards the ad with minimal intention to purchase.
