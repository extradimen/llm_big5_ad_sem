**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (score = 3) – Although it's targeted at health-conscious individuals, my personality doesn't strongly connect with its message.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (score = 4) – The promise of energy and looking good appeals to a broad audience and piques curiosity.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (score = 5) – On paper, it aligns well with maintaining vitality, which is valuable across many lifestyles.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (score = 4) – The visual appeal combined with health benefits makes the ad visually engaging but not overwhelmingly so.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Score = 2 (Disagree) – My current financial constraints (monthly income range of 26,000,000–35,000,000 VND as a student living with parents) and personal priorities might prevent an immediate purchase.
   - **Try to Buy:** Score = 3 (Neutral/Agree) – There's potential interest if I come across it in the right context or during periods of financial flexibility.
   - **Consider Buying:** Score = 3 (Strongly Agree) – The product aligns with wellness goals, making me open to considering it when budget allows.

Overall, while finding aspects compelling and the ad well-designed, my immediate purchase intent is tempered by practical considerations.
