   - **Interesting:** Agree (4). The promise of staying energized and looking best is appealing to me.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5). I appreciate a well-crafted ad that effectively communicates benefits relevant to daily life.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2). Despite the appeal, its attractiveness falls short for my reserved nature; it feels slightly too hyperbolic and not tailored enough.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral (3). While I am open-minded due to its benefits, there are other factors like budget, personal needs validation, and brand credibility.
   - **Will try to buy the product:** Agree (4). The idea aligns with my planning habits and desire for better daily energy levels.
