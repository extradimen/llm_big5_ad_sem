**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 4)**: The content is somewhat appealing due to its focus on energy and appearance enhancement.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 3)**: It’s engaging enough but doesn’t grab my full attention given my reserved nature.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5)**: While it seems credible, it resonates with practical aspects of daily life, though not completely compelling for me.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 3)**: The visual and messaging are decent but don't strongly draw me in.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2)**: Given my financial situation and cautious nature, I am unlikely to commit without more assurance.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1)**: Minimal intention; existing brands or budget constraints weigh heavily against trying something new.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 3)**: There's a slight consideration due to its promise of benefits, but other factors like necessity and price points need careful evaluation before making any purchase decision. 

Overall, while the ad is somewhat well-received on an informational level, my reserved nature and practical approach make it less likely for me to act upon this promotion immediately.
