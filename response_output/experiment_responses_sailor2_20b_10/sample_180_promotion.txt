**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3/7):** The ad is neutral; it doesn't strongly evoke positive feelings but isn’t outright disliked.
  - **Interesting (4/7):** Finds the concept appealing due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, though not extremely so.
  - **Good (5/7):** Appreciates the well-crafted messaging but lacks strong emotional connection or excitement.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** While not visually unattractive, it fails to capture attention strongly.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (1/7):** Strongly disagree; there isn't enough incentive for an immediate purchase decision given the current circumstances and priorities.
  - **Try (2/7):** Slightly higher than "intend," but still low—might consider a trial based on friends' recommendations or promotions, not solely from this ad.
  - **Consider (3/7):** Neutral tendency; acknowledges it could be considered in the future if other factors align better with personal needs and budget.

Overall, though moderately positive about aspects of the ad, practical concerns and daily priorities mean a strong purchase intention is absent. However, an open mind for potential future engagement keeps the score slightly above disinterest.
