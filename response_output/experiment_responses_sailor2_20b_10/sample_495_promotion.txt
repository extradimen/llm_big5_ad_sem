**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score=3):** While I appreciate its intent to energize and enhance appearance, my reserved nature means it doesn't particularly excite me.
   - **Interesting (score=4):** The idea of a drink providing dual benefits is engaging but not groundbreaking for someone who values practicality over novelty.
   - **Good (score=3):** It seems credible enough, though I lean more towards skepticism regarding claims on instant results due to my generally distrustful nature.
   - **Attractive (score=5):** The promise of looking and feeling good is appealing; however, the ad's messaging feels somewhat generic compared to specific benefits that might interest me personally.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (score=2):** Not a strong desire right now due to existing routines and budget considerations.
   - **Try (score=2):** I might give it a try if available at a reasonable price, but not eagerly sought out.
   - **Consider (score=3):** It's on the radar for future consideration as my lifestyle may occasionally need a boost in energy or appearance.

Overall, while there is moderate appeal and potential interest driven by practical benefits, personal traits like skepticism and careful decision-making reduce strong inclination to immediate purchase.
