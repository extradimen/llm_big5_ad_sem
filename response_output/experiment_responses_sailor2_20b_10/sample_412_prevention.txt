**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**:  
   - **Like (Score 3)**: I have a neutral to slightly positive view of the ad; it's not overly appealing but doesn't turn me off.
   - **Interesting (Score 4)**: The message is moderately engaging, tapping into common fatigue and appearance concerns.
   - **Good (Score 2)**: While straightforward in its claim, the effectiveness as a compelling advertisement feels average to below-average.
   - **Attractive (Score 5)**: It's somewhat attractive due to addressing real-life issues but lacks significant emotional connection or creativity.

2. **Purchase Intention**:  
   - **Intend to Purchase (Score 3)**: I might consider trying it based on its claim, though not strongly motivated.
   - **Will Try (Score 3)**: There's a mild curiosity driven by the potential benefit, but no strong commitment yet.
   - **Consider Buying (Score 4)**: It lands in the "think about later" category. The ad has made me think it could be useful, so I'm open to giving it a try if opportunity arises.

Overall, while the message resonates with my needs for staying alert and looking energetic, its presentation falls short of being compelling or inspiring enough for an immediate purchase decision. It's more about potential future interest rather than instant action.
