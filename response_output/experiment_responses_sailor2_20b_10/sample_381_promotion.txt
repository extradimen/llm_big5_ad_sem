**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3):** While the idea of staying energized is appealing, it doesn't evoke strong feelings due to my practical nature and skepticism.
   - **Interesting (4):** The concept has some novelty but lacks deeper engagement for me personally.
   - **Good (2):** Given my background, I view ads with a critical eye; this one seems overpromising without specific details or proof.
   - **Attractive (3):** Generally okay visually and appealing to the need for energy, yet not compelling enough.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (2):** Not high intention due to skepticism about its effectiveness.
   - **Try (2):** Might give it a chance if offered at a reasonable price or through trusted channels.
   - **Consider (4):** Open-minded but cautious; I'll need more reassurance before making an actual purchase decision.

Overall, the advertisement appeals slightly on surface-level benefits but lacks depth and trustworthiness to drive strong intent in my unique demographic and personality context. Balance between skepticism and curiosity keeps me open for consideration rather than immediate action.
