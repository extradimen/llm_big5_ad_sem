**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
    - **I like the ad (score=3):** The catchy phrase seems generic and not compelling enough for me given my reserved nature.
    - **Interesting (score=4):** It's mildly interesting due to its promise of energy, but it doesn't excite or stand out much in a crowded market.
    - **Good (score=5):** While the idea aligns with wanting both physical and mental well-being, I need more evidence before fully endorsing it.
    - **Attractive (score=2):** The lack of personal resonance and my tendency to be cautious makes this ad appear less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase (score=1):** Strongly disagree; the current version doesn't drive me towards immediate action.
    - **Try to buy (score=1):** Also strongly disagree; I won’t make an effort without further persuasion or credible information.
    - **Consider buying (score=2):** Mild agreement, indicating that while it hasn’t convinced me fully, there's a slight consideration if more details and benefits are provided.

Overall, the ad needs to offer tangible evidence, align better with my reserved but caring personality, and address specific concerns about trust and thoroughness to move me towards any form of purchase intention.
