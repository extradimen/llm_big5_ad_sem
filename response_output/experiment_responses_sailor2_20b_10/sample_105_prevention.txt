**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (2/7):** While I acknowledge the potential value of the drink in preventing tiredness and dull appearance, my reserved nature makes me less enthusiastic about it.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The ad’s message is clear but not particularly engaging due to its straightforward approach; hence, just above neutral interest.
   - **Good (4/7):** Despite some reservations, the messaging appears valid and health-focused, which leans toward a positive evaluation.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** It's moderately attractive since it appeals to maintaining energy levels but lacks strong visual or emotional appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (5/7):** Though I value the product’s benefits, my cautious and thorough nature may push me towards further research before committing.
   - **Try (6/7):** Given its reasonable price range for a monthly income of >46 million VND, there's strong inclination to give it a try due to helpfulness and unselfish preference toward personal well-being.
   - **Consider (7/7):** Ultimately, I am highly likely to consider this product seriously given my concern about staying alert and energetic, despite the ad's moderate appeal. 

Overall, while the advertisement is moderately appealing, strong practical considerations align with high purchase intent.
