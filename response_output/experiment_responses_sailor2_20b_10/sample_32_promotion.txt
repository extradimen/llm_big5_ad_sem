### Ad Attitude:

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 2)** - It has an average level of interest for me; energetic lifestyle claims resonate somewhat but are common in many ads.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - Neutral to slightly positive, as it effectively communicates its benefits though nothing groundbreaking.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Slightly above neutral, decent visuals or messaging might grab my attention briefly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; personal reservations about trying new products and general tendency towards caution make it unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning toward no, unless a significant discount or strong recommendation influences me.
3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 3)** - I am open but not actively inclined; considering is possible based on future needs and circumstances.

Overall, while the ad has some potential appeal due to its promises of energy and appearance improvement, my cautious nature and preference for stability over novelty result in a low likelihood of immediate purchase. However, it remains within consideration if specific conditions align with my lifestyle or health goals.
