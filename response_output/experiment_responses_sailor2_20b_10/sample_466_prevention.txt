**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (4/7):** While the ad is mildly engaging, it doesn't evoke strong personal interest.
  - **Interesting (3/7):** The message about fatigue and dullness seems generic; I've seen similar claims before.
  - **Good (5/7):** It effectively communicates a need for energy, which aligns with my daily life. However, the presentation feels somewhat clich√©.
  - **Attractive (2/7):** Despite its intended appeal, it lacks visual or emotional depth that would make me genuinely drawn to buying.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (4/7):** Although I recognize a potential benefit, the strong desire is lacking.
  - **Try to Buy (3/7):** Neutral curiosity exists due to needing better energy levels but not enough motivation alone.
  - **Consider Buying (4/7):** It's on my radar, and given my active lifestyle as a student, I might evaluate it further under circumstances requiring extra boost.

Overall, the ad resonates somewhat with practical needs but falls short in creating compelling emotional or unique value, resulting in moderate interest and consideration rather than immediate action.
