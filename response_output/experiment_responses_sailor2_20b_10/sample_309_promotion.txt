**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: Neutral to slightly positive. While I appreciate it being energetic and appealing, my strong tendencies towards being reserved make it less likable.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: Somewhat interested; promises of energy and looking good are relevant but not overly compelling given other factors.
   - **Good (Score: 3)**: Neutral. It feels adequate in message clarity but lacks the emotional resonance to be outstandingly convincing.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Slightly disagreeable. The ad's appeal doesn't resonate deeply due to my generally cautious and reserved nature.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree; despite the positive claims, personal financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make it hard for me to justify regular purchases.
   - **Will try (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards disagree. The cost might not be worth a trial period in my budget-conscious mindset.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 3)**: Slightly agree; while I wouldnâ€™t actively seek out this product, it's marginally on the radar if circumstances align and financial priorities change.

Overall, though there are aspects of the ad that grab attention momentarily, they do not outweigh practical considerations like cost, my reserved nature, or emotional stability concerns. Thus, a cautious but somewhat open attitude towards considering future purchases under more favorable conditions.
