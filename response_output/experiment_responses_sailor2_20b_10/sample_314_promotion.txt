**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score of 5) – The energy and appearance benefits resonate with me but don’t evoke strong personal connection.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (Score of 6) – It presents clear value propositions, making it engaging for someone looking to enhance daily performance.
   - **Good Ad:** Strongly Agree (Score of 7) – Effective messaging around staying energized and looking good appeals broadly.
   - **Attractive:** Agree (Score of 6) – The ad’s aesthetics are appealing but not overwhelmingly so given my neutral aesthetic preferences.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Agree (Score of 4) – While I appreciate the benefits, there's a gap between interest and immediate action due to other commitments or alternatives.
   - **Will Try:** Somewhat Likely to Try (3.5 towards Neutral) – The positive attributes encourage curiosity but don’t guarantee an instant purchase; further research might be needed.
   - **Consider Buying:** Agree (Score of 4) – I am open and would seriously consider the product, especially if other factors align well with my lifestyle.

Overall, while the advertisement is effectively delivered and aligned with values of energy and appearance enhancement, it falls short in driving an immediate purchase due to personal priorities and the need for additional deliberation. The strong agree on its goodness reflects positive sentiment but doesn't translate directly into a firm buy decision at this moment.
