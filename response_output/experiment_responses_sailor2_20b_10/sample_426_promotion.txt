  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad (score 2):** Given my reserved nature and tendency towards being unsociable, I find such energetic claims less appealing.
    - **Interesting (score 3):** The promise of staying energized is somewhat intriguing but not compelling enough to strongly engage me.
    - **Good (score 4):** Neutral on whether it's inherently good; the message aligns with self-care, but my skepticism makes it neither exceptionally positive nor negative.
    - **Attractive (score 2):** The ad doesn't visually or emotionally draw me in due to its potentially over-optimistic tone.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score 1):** Strongly disagree; my reserved and cautious nature, combined with a lack of emotional connection from the advertisement, leads me not to plan buying.
    - **Will try to buy this product (score 1):** Similarly, no intention or effort to actively seek it out despite needing energy boosts.
    - **Will consider buying (score 2):** Slight openness; given occasional health concerns, I might glance at the option but wouldn't prioritize purchasing based on this ad alone.

Overall, while there's a slight acknowledgment of usefulness, my reserved and critical mindset leads to low intention scores. The advertisement needs more tailored messaging or additional credibility for me personally.
