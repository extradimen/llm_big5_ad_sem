**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitudes (7-point scale):**
- **I like the ad.**: Score = 3 - Neutral; The straightforward message seems average.
- **I think the ad is interesting.**: Score = 4 - Agree; It has a clear and relevant prevention focus, which makes it somewhat engaging.
- **I believe the ad is good.**: Score = 2 - Disagree slightly; While informative, it lacks emotional resonance or creativity for strong belief.
- **I find the ad attractive.**: Score = 2 - Slightly disagreeable; It feels functional but not particularly visually appealing or compelling.

**Purchase Intentions:**
- **Intend to purchase this product.**: Score = 1 - Strongly Disagree; The advertisement's impact isn't strong enough given my reserved and slightly anxious personality.
- **Will try to buy this product.**: Score = 1 - Strongly Disagree; No urgency or desire prompted by the ad.
- **Will consider buying this product.**: Score = 2 - Slightly Agree; Itâ€™s on the radar but not a priority, given my other priorities and income level.

Overall, while I appreciate its preventive message, it doesn't sufficiently align with my preferences for compelling content or trigger purchase intent due to personal traits like caution and general emotional stability concerns.
