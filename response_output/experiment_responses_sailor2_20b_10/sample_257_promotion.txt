**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 3):** While energetic drinks appeal to some, my reserved nature means I don't find the advertisement particularly compelling.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** It's mildly interesting as it touches on staying energized and looking good, but doesn’t grab my attention intensely due to its broad target audience message.
   - **Good (score = 5):** The ad presents a straightforward benefit which is generally positive. However, the claims feel somewhat generic without specific details or evidence that resonate strongly with me personally.
   - **Attractive (score = 6):** Though not overly attractive, the idea of staying energized aligns marginally with my need for productivity in work and daily life.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score = 2):** I’m neutral; while beneficial qualities are presented, they aren't compelling enough given my reserved nature.
   - **Try to buy (score = 3):** Slightly inclined towards trying if it's convenient and fits within the budget range but not driven by strong desire or urgency.
   - **Consider buying (score = 4):** Will consider purchasing as a possible option when seeking an energy boost, especially during times of increased stress at work.

Overall, while the ad is moderately appealing due to its practical benefits, it doesn’t resonate strongly enough given my personal traits and preferences. The intention leans toward cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase or strong attraction.
