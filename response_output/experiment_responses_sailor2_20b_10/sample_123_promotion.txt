**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** 6 (Agree)  
     The ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, which aligns with maintaining productivity as a manager.
   
   - **Interesting:** 5 (Somewhat Agree)  
     While the concept is engaging, I think it could be more creative or unique in its messaging.

   - **Good:** 7 (Strongly Agree)  
     The message is clear and straightforward—staying energized and looking good. It resonates positively as a daily health goal for someone my age.
   
   - **Attractive:** 6 (Agree)  
     Visually, the ad might need improvement to fully capture attention, but its core promise is attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** 4 (Neutral Tending Toward Agree)
     I'm inclined towards healthier lifestyle choices, so it's a possibility. However, brand familiarity and price are crucial factors.
   
   - **Try:** 3 (Somewhat Likely)  
     Given my cautious yet thorough nature, I'd want to read reviews or try samples before committing fully.

   - **Consider:** 2 (Neutral Tending Toward Disagree)
     Despite the appeal, there's no immediate urgency. Therefore, it might sit on a list of options but won't be an automatic buy due to existing dietary habits and budget constraints.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s message, my cautious nature leans towards a more deliberate approach before making any purchase decision. The score reflects this balanced yet optimistic view as someone who values practicality over instant impulse buys.
