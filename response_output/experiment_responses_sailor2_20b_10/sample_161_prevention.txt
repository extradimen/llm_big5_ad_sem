**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like:** Neutral (Score = 3)  
   The ad's message is straightforward but not overly compelling for me, given my generally balanced and critical approach to marketing claims.

2. **Interesting:** Agree (Score = 4)  
   It intrigues as it highlights common issues like fatigue and dull appearance, which are relatable concerns.

3. **Good:** Strongly Agree (Score = 5)  
   The ad effectively communicates a potential problem that many can relate to, making its prevention message persuasive on an informational level.

4. **Attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2)  
   While the content is good, the overall appeal and presentation do not strongly capture my attention or emotional engagement. It feels more functional than emotionally resonant for someone like me who values both practicality and aesthetics.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Considered (Score = 3)
2. **Will Try to Buy:** Weak Disagree (Score = 1)  
   The ad's message is persuasive, but given my tendency toward thoroughness combined with a bit of nervousness and caution, I need more reassurance or perhaps real-life testimonials before making an immediate purchase decision.

3. **Consider Buying:** Considered (Score = 3)
   There’s enough interest to warrant exploring the product further—perhaps reading reviews or trying it out during a trial period if available.

Overall, while appreciating its preventive message and practicality, I need more personal interaction or additional evidence before committing fully, reflecting my balanced approach rooted in both helpfulness and critical skepticism.
