**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (2)**: As someone who tends to be reserved and not talkative, I'm moderately inclined towards it.
- **Interesting (3)**: The message is clear but lacks creativity or emotional connection for me; thus, neutral leaning positive.
- **Good (4)**: It’s effective in highlighting a potential issue related to energy levels and appearance. Reasonable credibility here.
- **Attractive (3)**: Not overly appealing as I value substance over flashy presentation.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (1)**: Strongly disagree; the ad doesn’t resonate enough with my lifestyle or personal needs.
- **Will try to buy this product (1)**: Similar reasoning applies—no compelling reason to give it a chance initially.
- **Consider buying this product (2)**: Neutral leaning toward considering, given that the drink could potentially address fatigue and appearance concerns if credible feedback is received. However, not high priority due to my reserved nature.

In summary, while acknowledging its practical message, I remain cautious about purchasing due to personal preferences and tendencies towards caution and thoroughness in decisions. The ad’s effectiveness for me lies more on potential consideration rather than immediate action or excitement.
