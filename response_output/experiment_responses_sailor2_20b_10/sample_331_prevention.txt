    3,   // Disagree slightly but neutral overall - interesting
    2,   // Strongly disagree on emotional stability and imagination aspects; thus, not good for me personally
    4    // Slightly attractive due to general appeal of energizing products, though limited personal relevance

  "purchase_intention_scores": [
    1,   // Strongly Disagree - I'm emotionally stable and don't feel the urgency or need based on my current lifestyle.
    2,   // Very unlikely to try; no compelling reason from ad
    3    // Might consider if under specific circumstances (e.g., increased workload), but not a priority now
  ]
}

**Evaluation Summary:**
1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
   - Neutral attraction due to general benefits mentioned.
2. **Purchase intention:**
   - Low likelihood of immediate purchase despite being aware of possible uses, primarily due to current emotional stability and personal habits.

The ad's message resonates moderately with my values but does not strongly align with my existing lifestyle or needs right now. Hence, while I find it somewhat interesting, my direct intent and willingness to buy remain low.
