Neutral leaning towards slightly agree; it’s engaging but not particularly appealing due to personal reservations about self-motivation.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**  
Moderately interested, acknowledging its messaging on fatigue and appearance enhancement as somewhat relatable without being compelling.

Somewhat skeptical; lacking strong evidence or personal relevance diminishes belief in its effectiveness.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**  
Strongly disagree – I’m not drawn to it due to my tendency towards practicality and slight cynicism about product claims.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**  
Low intention; while acknowledging its benefits, internal carelessness trait makes me less likely to actively pursue a purchase.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 3)**  
Somewhat neutral with slight interest in giving it a shot if convenient or on sale – driven by my habit of doing thorough jobs but tempered by occasional careless decisions.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3)**  
Neutral leaning towards agree; I find the concept potentially useful, yet external factors and personal habits would guide any actual purchase decision.

Overall, while appreciating its messaging, practical considerations, skepticism about instant fixes, and some tendency to procrastinate contribute to a moderate-to-low likelihood of purchasing despite acknowledging potential benefits.
