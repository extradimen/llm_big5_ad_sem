**Evaluation Details:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (3/7):** Neutral with a slight inclination towards liking it due to its directness.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):** The message about feeling tired and looking dull peaks my attention but doesn't captivate me fully.
3. **I believe the ad is good (5/7):** It seems effective in highlighting a potential problem, though it feels slightly exaggerated for its appeal.
4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** The presentation lacks personal resonance; I'm not particularly drawn to how it conveys benefits.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to purchase this product (1/7):** My current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and cautious nature make me less likely to commit fully.
2. **Will try to buy this product (2/7):** There's a slight curiosity based on the need for energy but not enough impetus to actively pursue it.
3. **Will consider buying this product (3/7):** It lands in my consideration set, especially if there are cost-effective options or special promotions.

In summary, while I acknowledge the ad's effectiveness in raising awareness of potential health concerns, personal priorities and financial limitations hold back a strong inclination to purchase. The attractiveness is moderate but not compelling enough for immediate action.
