**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:**  
   - **Score: 4 (Neutral)** - While I appreciate the positive messaging and energetic tone, it doesn't strongly resonate with my personal tastes.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   - **Score: 5 (Somewhat Agree)** - The promise of staying energized appeals to me, but it's not groundbreaking enough to hold my attention intensely.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   - **Score: 6 (Agree)** - It conveys clear benefits and seems well-produced; however, its effectiveness feels somewhat overgeneralized for a daily routine.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   - **Score: 3 (Disagree)** - The visuals might be slick but don't align perfectly with my preference towards more authentic or unique presentations.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:**  
   - **Score: 2 (Somewhat Disagree)** - Despite the benefits, other factors like brand loyalty and existing routines make me hesitant.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:**  
   - **Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)** - The ad doesn't compel immediate action; I prefer seeing concrete evidence or reviews before making a commitment.

3. **I will consider buying this product:**  
   - **Score: 2 (Somewhat Agree)** - There's enough information to keep it on my radar, but additional research is needed for an informed decision.

Overall, while the ad presents itself attractively and has a solid message, personal preferences and practical considerations lower its impact on immediate purchase intent. Further evaluation would be necessary before making a buying decision.
