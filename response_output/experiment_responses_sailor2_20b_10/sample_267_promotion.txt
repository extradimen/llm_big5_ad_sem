**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** (3) - While it's not explicitly disliked, I don't find it particularly engaging given my personality traits.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (2) - It seems generic and lacks a unique hook to capture my attention.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (4) - There isn’t enough detail or evidence of credibility for me, but I'm not strongly against it either.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (3) - The promise of energy and looking best doesn't align with my priorities; thus, it's only moderately appealing.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (1) - Strongly disagree – I'm not motivated by superficial claims alone.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (1) - Strongly disagree – Given my tendencies towards thoroughness and skepticism, I need more compelling evidence or personal experience.
3. **I will consider buying the product:** (2) – Neutral; it's not out of the question but doesn't resonate enough for immediate consideration.

Overall, while open to possibilities, this ad falls short in capturing my interest due to its generic nature, lack of personalized appeal, and insufficient credibility alignment with my values and preferences. Therefore, I'm unlikely to be swayed towards a purchase decision based on these points alone.
