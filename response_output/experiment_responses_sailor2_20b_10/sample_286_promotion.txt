**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**  
    Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate the concept but it doesn't excite me strongly.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**
    Moderately engaging, though not entirely compelling for someone with my background and preferences.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**  
    Generally positive; the message seems well-crafted but lacks personal relevance.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2)**
    Unappealing; it doesn't align closely enough with my lifestyle or priorities.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1)**  
    Strongly disagree; I don’t see immediate value in a drink for energy and appearance.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**
    Slightly agree, but not motivated enough without further incentives or personal need.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 2)**  
    Somewhat neutral; while it doesn't push me towards a purchase, I might think about trying if the price is right.

Overall, though there are positive elements in the ad’s execution and message quality, my practical considerations and personal values lead to low intent for purchasing the drink at this time. The focus on energy and looks does not resonate strongly with someone like myself from Southeast Asia, particularly considering economic constraints and daily priorities as a blue-collar worker.
