**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score: 6)**: The slogan is catchy and resonates with a general desire for energy and appearance enhancement.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5)**: It captures attention but does not stand out uniquely in an oversaturated market of health & wellness products.
  - **Good (Score: 4.5)**: While well-meaning, it lacks specific details on benefits or science-backed claims to truly impress.
  - **Attractive (Score: 3.5)**: The overall appeal is adequate but not compelling enough given my cautious and analytical nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Low score (2) due to the lack of detailed evidence or personal needs being directly addressed by this particular drink.
  - **Will Try to Buy**: Even lower (1), as no strong motivation exists for attempting a new purchase amidst existing, trusted brands and routines.
  - **Consider Buying**: Moderate score (2). The ad's message does not deter me entirely, but additional information or personal relevance is necessary before considering the product seriously.

In summary, while I appreciate its effort to engage with consumers' desires, it falls short in convincing an experienced civil servant like myself who values substantiated benefits and thoroughness. A stronger focus on specific health claims, credibility, and alignment with my lifestyle would enhance both appeal and purchase intention.
