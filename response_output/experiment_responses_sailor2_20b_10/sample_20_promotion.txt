**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**  
   - **Like (score = 3):** Neutral to slightly positive; it doesn't strongly resonate but isn’t disliked either.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** Moderate interest—promises energy and looks are appealing topics, especially in my age group.
   - **Good (score = 5):** Generally favorable since staying energized and looking good have real value.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** Not very attractive; while the concept is decent, execution could be better. The ad feels somewhat generic.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Moderate intent (score = 4); it's on my radar as useful but not a must-buy.
   - **Will try to buy:** Likely consideration when needed (score = 4); I might make an effort if circumstances align, like during busy periods or needing an energy boost.
   - **Consider buying:** Low-to-moderate consideration (score = 3); potential purchase depending on price and brand credibility but not a priority.

Overall, while the ad's message is relevant to my demographic needs, its presentation could be stronger. I’m moderately inclined towards trying it out rather than an immediate buy decision. The balanced score reflects these mixed feelings.
