**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    - **I like the ad (3):** It's neutral but slightly positive due to its focus on energy and appearance.
    - **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized is engaging but not groundbreaking.
    - **Good (5):** The message seems well-meaning, aligns with self-care values, though it doesn't strongly resonate personally.
    - **Attractive (6):** As a sociable person who appreciates wellness trends, the ad visually and conceptually appeals to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (2):** While interested in its benefits, my budget constraints mean immediate purchase isn’t high priority.
    - **Try (3):** The idea of trying it once is reasonable; I'm open to occasional indulgence for a boost.
    - **Consider (4):** I’ll think about buying if there are convenient offers or reviews aligning with expectations.

Overall, the ad evokes moderate positivity and mild interest without overwhelming commitment. My balanced attitude reflects practicality combined with an openness towards health-oriented products within budget limits.
