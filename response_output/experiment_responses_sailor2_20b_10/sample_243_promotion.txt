**Evaluation Notes:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **Like the Ad**: Neutral due to being generally talkative but with a strong preference for thoroughness rather than flashy presentations.
   - **Interesting**: Agree because it taps into wellness trends, which are relevant and appealing to health-conscious demographics like mine (postgraduate degree & managerial position).
   - **Good**: Disagree; while the premise is valid, the ad lacks persuasive evidence or credibility about staying energized and looking bestâ€”needs more substantiation.
   - **Attractive**: Strongly disagree. The appeal feels superficial compared to my reserved nature and emphasis on practical results.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Disagree because of the ad's lack of compelling details or personal relevance despite health-oriented interests.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral, indicating a willingness to explore if convinced by additional information (ingredients, customer testimonials).
   - **Consider Buying**: Agree with caution. Though I appreciate wellness products, making an informed decision requires further research and potential trial.

Overall, the ad sparks some interest but falls short on credibility and emotional connection needed for strong purchase intent from my perspective. Further details or compelling offers would likely increase consideration levels.
