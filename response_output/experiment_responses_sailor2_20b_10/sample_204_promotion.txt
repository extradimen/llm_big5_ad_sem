**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (4/7)**: While I appreciate its energetic and aspirational message, it feels a bit generic for me.
   - **Interesting (3/7)**: The promise of energy and appearance enhancement is okay but lacks personal relevance in my current lifestyle as a blue-collar worker focusing on practical tasks.
   - **Good (2/7)**: It’s decently crafted but doesn’t strongly connect with my values or needs; I’m more concerned about functionality over aesthetics.
   - **Attractive (3/7)**: The visual appeal is there, but it's not a strong pull factor given my focus on practical outcomes rather than mere attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (5/7)**: Despite some reservations, the benefits of staying energized could be useful during long shifts.
   - **Try to buy this product (6/7)**: Given its potential utility and reasonable price range for Southeast Asia, I might give it a try out of curiosity or necessity.
   - **Consider buying this product (7/7)**: It aligns somewhat with my need for staying alert at work, so considering regular use is likely.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately due to its straightforward message, practical benefits outweigh any perceived disconnect from more imaginative traits in myself. Thus, I'm inclined towards positive action but still critical of its universal appeal.
