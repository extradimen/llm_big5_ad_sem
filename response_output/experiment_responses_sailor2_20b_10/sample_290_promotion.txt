**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Strongly Agree (7) - My talkative and sociable nature makes me appreciate engaging ads.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (6) - The active imagination appeals to creative content, even if I don't always come up with new ideas myself.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral/Agree (5) - While it resonates on a personal level, its promises are somewhat generic and need more specific benefits for full conviction.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (4) - The claim of "look your best" might feel clichéd given my critical outlook; I value authenticity over superficial claims.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Low (3) - Despite liking the ad, there’s a gap between being energized and looking good—both crucial aspects aren't compelling enough.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Even lower (2) – The lack of originality in the idea makes me hesitant, preferring products that offer unique value.
3. **I will consider buying it**: Minimal consideration (1) - Although I appreciate effort and thoroughness in execution shown by other ads, this one doesn't spark immediate interest or trust for a purchase.

In summary, while I find the ad engaging and somewhat interesting, its generic claims don’t sufficiently align with my values and needs, leading to minimal intention to buy.
