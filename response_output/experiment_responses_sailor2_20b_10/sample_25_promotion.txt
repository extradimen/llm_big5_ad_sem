**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

- **I like the ad. (4)**: While I appreciate its energetic tone and visual appeal, it doesn't deeply resonate with me.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (3)**: The message is fairly standard for energy drinks but doesn’t stand out in an engaging way.
- **I believe the ad is good. (2)**: It’s average; nothing groundbreaking or persuasive from a personal perspective.
- **I find the ad attractive. (5)**: Some aspects are visually appealing, which helps to make it moderately attractive.

### Purchase Intention

- **I intend to purchase this product. (1)**: Strongly disagree. My current daily routine doesn't require an energy drink, and I prefer natural alternatives.
- **I will try to buy this product. (1)**: Also strongly disagree; lack of need or interest makes trying it unlikely.
- **I will consider buying this product. (2)**: Neutral leaning towards disinterest; might reconsider under unusual circumstances but not actively on my radar.

Overall, the ad's appeal is limited due to personal lifestyle choices and preferences in staying energized, making me less inclined toward purchasing despite its attractive visuals.
