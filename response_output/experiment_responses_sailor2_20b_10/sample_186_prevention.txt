**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - **Like (Score 3)**: While it's straightforward, I find the messaging a bit cliché and not particularly compelling.
   - **Interesting (Score 4)**: It’s somewhat interesting but lacks novelty or emotional engagement for me as an educated civil servant who values subtlety over hyperbolic claims. 
   - **Good (Score 5)**: The ad is effective in conveying the product benefit, but it could be better executed to resonate more deeply.
   - **Attractive (Score 2)**: Given my reserved and unselfish nature, I don't find the appeal very strong.

- **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend (Score 1)**: Strongly disagree; there isn’t enough personal alignment or compelling reason for immediate purchase.
   - **Try (Score 2)**: Disagree but slightly open to a tentative trial since it might address feeling tired, though not enthusiastically.
   - **Consider (Score 3)**: Neutral-to-mild agreement—while the ad prompts some thought about potential benefits, it doesn't convince me enough to actively seek out purchase.

Overall, while I acknowledge its effectiveness in basic communication, my reserved and careful nature leads me to give lower scores for both liking and intent to buy this product. The lack of strong personal appeal or urgency prevents a higher level of interest.
