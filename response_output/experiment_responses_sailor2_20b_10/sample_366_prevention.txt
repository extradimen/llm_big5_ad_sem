**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
    - **I like the ad (score = 4):** The slogan seems straightforward and relatable to everyday concerns but doesn't evoke strong positive feelings due to its commonality.
    - **Interesting (score = 5):** It piques curiosity about how this drink can improve energy levels, making it engaging enough to hold attention briefly.
    - **Good (score = 3):** While the message is clear and has practical appeal, there's no strong emotional or unique hook that makes me consider it highly credible.
    - **Attractive (score = 2):** The advertisement lacks charm or creative flair; hence, I find it only marginally attractive.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 3):** Neutral leaning towards cautious interest; though the ad resonates logically, there's no strong drive to buy immediately.
    - **Will try to buy this product (score = 3):** I might give it a chance if conveniently available and within budget during times of fatigue, but not actively seek out.
    - **Consider buying this product (score = 2):** There is consideration in the back of my mind, especially under circumstances where energy boosters are needed; however, other options or habits take priority.

In summary, while acknowledging its functional value and being somewhat interested, I find the ad adequately appealing but not compelling enough to spur an urgent purchase decision. The lack of creativity and emotional depth slightly hinder both overall engagement and immediate buying intent for a busy professional like myself.
