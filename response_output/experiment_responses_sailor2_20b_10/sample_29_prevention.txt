**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 5)**: The persuasive nature of the ad resonates with my tendency to find preventive health messages useful. However, it doesn't excite me strongly.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's decently engaging but not extremely captivating for someone who leans more towards practicality rather than flashy marketing.

- **Good (Score: 6)**: I believe the ad effectively communicates a tangible benefitâ€”avoiding tiredness and dull looks. This aligns with my helpful nature, making it a sensible message.
  
- **Attractive (Score: 3)**: While not unattractive, its simplicity might lack the emotional pull or creativity to strongly appeal given my strong disinterest in imaginative content.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 4)**: The ad's credibility is decently high, but it doesn't create an urgent need. My tendency towards thoroughness suggests I'd evaluate further.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Even though the message makes sense, my generally cautious and careful approach means trying before fully committing.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1)**: While acknowledging its potential benefits, my practical nature leans more towards waiting for reviews or further information rather than immediate purchase due to moderate skepticism about quick fixes. 

In summary, the ad is well-received but doesn't spur a strong impulse buy given my balanced and deliberate consumer attitude.
