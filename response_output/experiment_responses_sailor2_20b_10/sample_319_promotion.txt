**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (2)**: Neutral due to my reserved nature; while it's not unappealing, it doesn't excite me either.
   - **Interesting (3)**: The promise of energy and looking good is relevant but lacks the emotional pull I generally seek in ads. It’s mildly interesting for daily life needs.
   - **Good (4)**: As someone who values helpfulness and practicality, a claim of benefits like staying energized aligns with my priorities, making it decently believable.
   - **Attractive (5)**: While not strongly attractive due to my reserved nature, the focus on personal well-being is appealing enough.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase (2)**: My cautious approach and thorough job disapproval mean I won’t rush into buying just from an ad.
   - **Try to buy (3)**: There’s some consideration based on potential health benefits, but not strong enough for immediate action.
   - **Consider buying (4)**: The product aligns with maintaining daily vitality; given my occasional worries and busy lifestyle, I’m open to considering it seriously.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately due to its practicality and health focus, personal reservation and cautious decision-making result in a balanced yet thoughtful evaluation.
