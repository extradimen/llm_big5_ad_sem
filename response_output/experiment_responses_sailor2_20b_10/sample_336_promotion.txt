**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (3): The claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me but not strongly.
  - I think the ad is interesting (4): It has a general appeal due to its health and wellness focus, making it moderately intriguing.
  - I believe the ad is good (2): While not inherently misleading, it feels somewhat vague about real benefits; thus, my belief in its effectiveness is low.
  - I find the ad attractive (1): The messaging isn't compelling enough given my cautious nature, especially when considering trust issues and personal needs.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (2): It might not be a top priority due to limited belief in its claims and current financial constraints.
  - I will try to buy this product (1): No strong inclination or urgency; my skepticism over the ad's promises makes me hesitant.
  - I will consider buying it (2): The idea is mildly on the radar, but only if more information or personal need arises.

Overall, while some aspects of the ad are slightly engaging, they fall short in converting interest into a solid purchase intention due to my cautious personality and current circumstances.
