**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like (4):* The ad's premise isn't inherently disliked but doesn't evoke strong positive feelings either.
  - *Interesting (5):* It has an engaging message about potential fatigue and appearance changes without being too cliché.
  - *Good (3):* While somewhat effective, the claim feels a bit exaggerated; it lacks credible evidence to fully convince me of its benefits.
  - *Attractive (2):* The advertisement is not particularly appealing given my preferences for straightforward information over dramatic statements.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend (1):* Strongly disagree—I do not have immediate plans to purchase based on this ad alone.
  - *Try (1):* Also strongly disagree, as I find the claims less compelling compared to other factors influencing my decisions.
  - *Consider (2):* Neutral leaning towards disinterest; while it may get a slight consideration in future choices, my primary motivation isn't driven by this advertisement.

In summary, while acknowledging its message and potential relevance for fatigue management, the ad's presentation doesn’t sufficiently align with my values or persuade me to take immediate action. The product remains on the backburner given my skepticism about exaggerated claims without substantive proof.
