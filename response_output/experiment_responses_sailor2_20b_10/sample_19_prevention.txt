**Evaluation Details:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
1. **Like:** *Score = 4* - The advertisement is decent but doesn't particularly excite me; it feels somewhat generic.
2. **Interesting:** *Score = 5* - It does grab attention with a clear message, making it mildly interesting.
3. **Good:** *Score = 3* - I find the claim straightforward and functional but not highly persuasive or creative.
4. **Attractive:** *Score = 2* - While visually acceptable, it lacks emotional appeal to be considered attractive.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - Given my practical nature and thorough job approach, I wouldn't impulsively intend to purchase based solely on this ad.
2. **Try:** *Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - No immediate motivation or curiosity to try the product; it lacks compelling relevance for me.
3. **Consider:** *Score = 2* - There is a slight consideration due to acknowledging fatigue prevention, but additional information or reviews would be needed before making an informed decision.

In summary, while I acknowledge its functional message and moderate appeal, my strong emphasis on practicality over emotional cues keeps the ad from significantly influencing my purchase intention. The overall tone needs more depth to resonate with someone like me who prioritizes careful decisions in both personal life and work.
