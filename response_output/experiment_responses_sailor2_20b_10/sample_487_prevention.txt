**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)** - The concept of preventing fatigue and dullness appeals to my need for energy but it's not particularly exciting or original.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - While relevant, its straightforward messaging doesn't captivate me enough; I'm already aware of such product promises in this category.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)** - It’s effective to a degree but lacks emotional depth or unique creative flair that would make it stand out.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - The visual and copy are functional, yet not visually appealing enough for me personally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** - It aligns with my need for energy boosters but isn't compelling enough alone.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - I might give it a shot, especially if other factors like brand reputation or friends' recommendations sway me.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4)** - It’s on my radar for consideration; the perceived benefits are worth exploring under appropriate circumstances.

Overall, while the ad resonates slightly with my need for energy and attractiveness of appearance, it doesn't evoke strong feelings or immediate action due to its moderate creativity and execution. I'm open to trying if other influences align favorably but not compelled by this advertisement alone.
