**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3)**  
   Neutral to slightly negative; as a reserved and cautious individual who tends to be careless, I find it generic rather than compelling.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)**  
   Slightly positive but not highly engaging—promises seem standard without innovative hooks for my imagination.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)**  
   Neutral leaning toward agreement; promises of energy and looking best align with daily concerns, though no standout uniqueness persuades strong belief.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 2)**  
   Low score due to lackluster presentation and failure to connect on a deeper emotional or imaginative level—appears too generic for my taste.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1)**  
   Strongly disagree; the ad's messaging doesn't inspire immediate action, considering other factors like credibility and personal priorities.

2. **Will try to buy this product (score = 2)**  
   Disagree slightly—might consider a trial if prompted by external influences or low cost but not driven internally.

3. **Consider buying this product (score = 3)**  
   Neutral; the benefits are reasonable, yet without strong engagement from the ad, it remains on the list of possibilities rather than a priority purchase. 

Overall, while I see utility in staying energized and looking good, the advertisement does not resonate deeply enough to influence immediate or future purchasing behavior for me personally.
