**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** 3 (Neutral)
   - The message feels straightforward but doesn't particularly resonate with my outgoing and trusting nature. It lacks emotional appeal.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 2 (Disagree)
   - The claim seems generic; I've heard similar warnings before, making it less intriguing.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 4 (Agree)
   - While not compelling, it conveys a simple but potentially useful health message, aligning with my helpful and unselfish traits concerning others' well-being.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - The appeal isn't visually or emotionally engaging; the focus on tiredness and dull looks doesn’t grab my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Neutral)
   - The information is relevant, but it’s not strong enough motivation for an immediate buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my financial constraints and cautious nature, I wouldn't actively pursue buying without more compelling reasons or discounts.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 2 (Neutral)
   - It’s a possibility but won’t be top of mind; further information about benefits or special offers could tip the scales slightly in favor of considering it.

Overall, while acknowledging its preventative health value, the ad does not strongly influence my immediate purchase decision due to lackluster appeal and practical limitations.
