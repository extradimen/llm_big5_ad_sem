**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
  - *Like (3/7)*: The ad feels slightly appealing due to its promise of staying energized and looking good.
  - *Interesting (2/7)*: It doesn't grab my attention strongly; the claims seem common in this category.
  - *Good (4/7)*: I find it decent, but not particularly compelling given similar products on the market.
  - *Attractive (3/7)*: The visuals and messaging are averageâ€”it's visually okay but nothing memorable.

- **Purchase Intentions**: 
  - *Intend to Purchase (2/7)*: My current financial situation makes me cautious. I don't see this as a priority right now, despite the benefits.
  - *Try to Buy (3/7)*: If offered at an attractive price or during a special sale, it might be worth trying once.
  - *Consider Buying (5/7)*: There's some interest due to my desire for energy and self-care; I'm open to considering this product if circumstances change.

Overall, while the ad does not strongly resonate with me personally, there is a modest level of consideration given its promise and potential benefit. My purchasing decision will depend on practical constraints (income) but leaves room for future interest.
