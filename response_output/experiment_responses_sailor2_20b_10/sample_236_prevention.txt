**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 5):** The strong emphasis on potential negative consequences ("tired" and "look dull") resonates with my concern for personal presentation and energy levels.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** While engaging, it's a bit predictable in its messaging; common health drink marketing strategies make it familiar rather than innovative.
   - **Good (score = 3):** Neutral on quality but effective at addressing potential customer anxieties related to appearance and fatigue. 
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** The ad feels slightly manipulative, playing more into fear of looking unattractive than offering genuine value.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score = 4):** While the message aligns with my desires for staying energetic and presentable, it doesn't fully convince me without additional proof or personal experience.
   - **Will try to buy this product (score = 2.5):** Given its widespread appeal, I might consider sampling it out of curiosity but lack a strong incentive right now.
   - **Will consider buying the product (score = 3.5):** It does spark consideration due to my talkative and outgoing nature; ensuring energy levels is important for social interactions.

In summary, while the ad makes logical points about performance anxiety and fatigue prevention, its overall attractiveness and impact on immediate purchasing intent are moderate due to concerns over credibility and personal experience preference.
