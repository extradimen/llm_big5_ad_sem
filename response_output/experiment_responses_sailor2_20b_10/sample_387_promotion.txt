**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (3/7):**
   - Neutral to slightly positive due to my agreeable nature but not strongly aligned with typical managerial stress management or personal grooming concerns.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4/7):**
   - Moderate interest driven by its emphasis on energy and appearance, resonating somewhat as a busy manager.

3. **I believe the ad is good (5/7):**
   - Slightly higher rating due to an appreciation for credible messaging about daily performance but not deeply convincing.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):**
   - Low attractiveness; personal preference leans towards practicality over flashy claims, and I am slightly cautious regarding health/beauty promises.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (6/7):** 
   - High intention driven by my thoroughness in seeking products that support productivity and appearance without committing immediately.

2. **Will try to buy this product (7/7):**
   - Strong inclination to give it a shot based on its promise of energy boost and improved look, aligning with personal goals but retaining skepticism about immediate results.

3. **Will consider buying the product (4/7):** 
   - While not strongly influenced by the ad alone, I acknowledge potential value in an energizing drink for sustained performance and will factor it into future purchase decisions considering more detailed reviews or real-life testimonials. 

In summary, the advertisement is moderately appealing but does not fully captivate due to my reserved skepticism regarding health product claims. However, its strong points align with practical aspirations, nudging a high intent-to-try and considerate buying behavior.
