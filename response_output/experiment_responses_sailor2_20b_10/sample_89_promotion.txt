**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
    - **Like (5)**: Neutral to slightly positive. The ad has an appealing message but doesn't strongly resonate with my values or needs.
    - **Interesting (4)**: I find the concept of staying energized and looking good intriguing, though it's not groundbreaking.
    - **Good (6)**: It seems well-crafted and credible enough, highlighting both practical benefits and aesthetic appeal.
    - **Attractive (3)**: The visual and messaging might be polished but lacks a strong emotional draw for me given my personality traits.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
    - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: Despite the good presentation, I'm not compelled enough to actually intend purchasing it immediately due to mixed priorities.
    - **Try to Buy (1)**: Low likelihood; the ad doesn't trigger a strong desire or immediate need in my routine.
    - **Consider Buying (4)**: It's on my radar, especially given its claims align somewhat with maintaining energy and appearance. I might evaluate further if there are specific offers or personal needs arise.

Overall, while appreciating the well-rounded promotional effort, it doesn't sufficiently engage me to make a decisive purchase decision based on current circumstances and preferences.
