**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
    - I like the ad (`3` on scale): The concept seems suitable for staying energized and looking good, but it doesn't resonate strongly given my personal context.
    - I think the ad is interesting (`4` on scale): It's mildly engaging due to its focus on daily benefits, aligning somewhat with practical needs.
    - I believe the ad is good (`5` on scale): The message of staying energized and looking best has merit but doesn't inspire strong belief because it feels more aspirational than essential for my current lifestyle.
    - I find the ad attractive (`2` on scale): It’s not visually or emotionally compelling enough, especially considering my tendency toward practicality rather than marketing flair.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point Scale):**
    - I intend to purchase this product (`1` on scale): Given my budget constraints and existing routines, it doesn’t align with immediate priorities.
    - I will try to buy this product (`2` on scale): There’s a slight inclination if the price is right and aligns well with daily needs but not enough motivation for an active effort.
    - I will consider buying this product (`3` on scale): It's worth considering in future, especially during promotions or when budget allows.

Overall, while recognizing the potential benefits highlighted in the ad, my practicality, financial constraints, and personal priorities lead to a moderate interest but low immediate purchase intention.
