}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (4):** While it's not my favorite format, I appreciate its straightforward message.
   - **Interesting (5):** The concept is relatable for daily life but doesn't captivate me much.
   - **Good (6):** It conveys a clear problem and solution effectively, so on balance, I find it reasonably well-done.
   - **Attractive (3):** While not unappealing, the ad's focus on fatigue and dullness might seem slightly manipulative to someone who values emotional stability like me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (2):** The appeal is moderate; I'd need more convincing beyond just avoiding tiredness.
   - **Try to buy the product (2):** Mild curiosity, but not enough to drive an immediate decision.
   - **Consider buying the product (3):** Worth pondering if I see positive reviews or personal benefits align with my needs.

In summary, while the ad is decent and reflects a common issue effectively, it doesn't strongly resonate due to some personal preferences around emotional appeals. My purchase intention remains low-medium, indicating potential consideration but not an immediate commitment.
