**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: 
   - *Score: 5 (Agree)*
     Given my talkative and outgoing nature, I appreciate the energy it projects. However, since I'm not particularly focused on personal appearance or health drinks, the appeal is moderate.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**:
   - *Score: 4 (Somewhat Agree)*
     It has a promising hook but doesn't entirely captivate me due to its generality and lack of specifics relevant to my daily life as a blue-collar worker.

3. **I believe the ad is good**:
   - *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
     The claims sound effective for some, but without more details on how it addresses specific needs or testimonials, I remain uncertain about its credibility.

4. **I find the ad attractive**:
   - *Score: 4 (Somewhat Agree)*
     It's visually appealing and energizing, aligning with a general mood of positivity, though not compelling enough to be irresistible given my cautious nature regarding health products.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: 
   - *Score: 2 (Disagree)*
     While the idea is good, I prioritize more immediate needs like food and basic necessities over supplements or energy drinks with uncertain benefits for my budget.

2. **I will try to buy this product**:
   - *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
     The cost likely exceeds my monthly income constraints ($<15,000,000 VND), making it impractical even if I wanted to give it a shot.

3. **I will consider buying this product**:
   - *Score: 2 (Disagree)**
     Considering the ad's limited appeal and financial limitations, I'm not inclined towards giving serious thought to purchasing, despite some mild interest in staying energized.

Overall, while I appreciate the positive messaging from an energetic perspective, practical concerns like budget and immediate necessity outweigh any potential benefits for me. Hence, low purchase intention scores reflect this realistic evaluation.
