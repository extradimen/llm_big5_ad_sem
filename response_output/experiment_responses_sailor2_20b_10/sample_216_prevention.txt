**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**   
   - **Like (3/7):** Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's messaging feels somewhat relevant but not particularly appealing.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** Somewhat interesting due to the focus on fatigue, which is a common concern for blue-collar workers like myself.
   - **Good (2/7):** Marginally agreeable; the claims are standard and lack strong evidence or unique value propositions that resonate deeply with me.
   - **Attractive (1/7):** Strongly disagree. The overall presentation doesn't draw much attention, feeling more generic than engaging.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**   
   - **Intend to Purchase (2/7):** Low intention; the ad's persuasive elements are weak, and other priorities take precedence with my limited income.
   - **Will Try to Buy (3/7):** Slightly higher but still cautious. There might be an impulse for a quick fix when exhausted, yet it won't be a priority purchase.
   - **Consider Buying (2/7):** Mild consideration; I acknowledge the need to stay energized but don't see this product as indispensable given my budget constraints and general trust issues with such claims.

Overall, while understanding the concerns addressed in the ad, its lack of compelling evidence, engaging presentation, and alignment with personal values result in a low likelihood for me to purchase it despite acknowledging its potential relevance.
