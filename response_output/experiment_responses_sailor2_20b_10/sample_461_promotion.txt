**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: The ad doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its focus on energy and appearance, which might seem superficial. My reserved nature makes it less appealing.
  
- **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's somewhat interesting as staying energized is useful, but the emphasis on "look your best" feels a bit gimmicky.

- **Good (Score: 5)**: The concept of maintaining energy levels seems reasonable and generally good; however, its messaging doesn’t fully align with my values or lifestyle preferences.

- **Attractive (Score: 2)**: I find it mildly unattractive as the ad plays more to youth-oriented aesthetics rather than addressing practical needs for someone in a blue-collar job like mine. 

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree – Given my monthly income, priorities lean towards essential items over energy drinks, and there's no compelling reason why I need it.

- **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Slightly agree – There might be a chance if someone gifted me the drink or if circumstances require an occasional boost in energy but not as part of my regular budget.

- **Consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Neutral leaning negative – While the idea isn't entirely off, it doesn’t match my daily needs nor align well with my cautious spending habits and lack of enthusiasm for marketing hype surrounding personal appearance products. Thus, consideration remains low on my list of priorities.

In summary, while there are elements that mildly interest me (energy), overall attitude leans negative due to the mismatch in values and practicality; hence, purchase intention is minimal at best.
