**Explanation:**
- **Ad Attitude**: 
  - **Like:** Neutral because while the message seems positive, it doesn’t fully connect with my personality traits or lifestyle as a blue-collar worker focusing on work diligence and emotional stability issues.
  - **Interesting:** Agree due to the energizing aspect appealing to maintaining daily performance but falls short in personal relevance.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree since ensuring energy levels is important for me, making it seem like a valid health concern.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree as beauty-centric aspects don't align with my priorities and might feel superficial.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree; the product’s benefits are secondary to other needs (monthly income constraints, focus on essentials).
  - **Try to Buy:** Neutral; open-minded but not actively seeking out.
  - **Consider Buying:** Agree; potential future consideration if specific health concerns arise or affordability improves.

Balancing practicality with personal values influences my attitude towards the ad and purchase intent. The overall evaluation highlights a moderate appeal without immediate commitment due to real-world constraints.
