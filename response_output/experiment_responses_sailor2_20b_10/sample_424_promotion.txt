**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score = 4)
   - The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me but doesnâ€™t create strong enthusiasm.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score = 5)
   - It's attention-grabbing, especially for someone who values self-care.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (Score = 6)
   - The messaging aligns with health and beauty trends, making it a credible claim in my eyes.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Neutral-leaning Disagree (Score = 3)
   - While it has an appealing message, I'm not drawn to flashy or overly persuasive presentations.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Slightly Agree (Score = 2)
   - The appeal is there, but the high price point could be a deterrent given my monthly income constraints.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product**: Neutral (Score = 2)
   - I might consider giving it a trial based on its benefits but not without further research.

3. **Consider buying this product**: Agree (Score = 3)
   - Although the ad resonates, practical considerations like budget and personal needs will influence my final decision.

In summary, while appreciating the message's alignment with health-conscious values, I remain cautious about committing to a purchase due to financial constraints and other factors. The overall impression is positive but not compelling enough for immediate action.
