**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad (score: 4)** - Neutral with a slight positive tilt; it's not particularly engaging given my personality.
- **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)** - Somewhat agreeable, but Iâ€™m more focused on practical benefits rather than creative appeal.
- **I believe the ad is good (score: 2)** - Slightly disagree; while straightforward, it lacks compelling evidence or emotional resonance for me.
- **I find the ad attractive (score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; its message feels generic and not aligned with my personal priorities.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)** - Neutral leaning towards low intent. The lack of strong engagement doesn't push me to make a commitment.
- **I will try to buy this product (score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; the advertisement is not persuasive enough, especially considering I am already managing my finances carefully as an independent student with fixed income constraints.
- **I will consider buying it (score: 2)** - Neutral; there's a slight awareness but no immediate action or positive reinforcement to make this purchase worthwhile. Practical benefits would need more evidence before consideration turns into intent.

Overall, the ad does not significantly influence my purchasing behavior due to its lack of personal relevance and compelling messaging.
