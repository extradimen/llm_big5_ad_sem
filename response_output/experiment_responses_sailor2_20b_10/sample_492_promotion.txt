**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4)  
     While I appreciate its goal to promote energy and appearance benefits, my slightly reserved nature means it doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 3)
     It’s engaging but not extraordinary—just another health or wellness promotion in a saturated market.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5)  
     The message of staying energized and looking best resonates with my values, though it feels standard. 
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 3)
     It’s visually appealing but not compelling enough to draw in someone already busy and seeking a reliable solution.

2. **Purchase Intentions:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2)  
     Though helpfulness drives me towards products that support well-being, the lack of specific details about effectiveness makes it hard for an immediate buy.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3)
     There's curiosity but not urgency; I might test it out if there are compelling user reviews or discounts.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2)  
     Even with my generally trusting nature, the need for more proof and personal relevance lowers consideration to moderate levels.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its benefits, my neutral outlook on planning, strong nervousness, and focus on reliability mean higher engagement is necessary before converting into a purchase.
