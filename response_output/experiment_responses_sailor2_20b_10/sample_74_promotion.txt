**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4)** - The messaging aligns with general wellness trends and personal appearance goals but doesn't excite me excessively.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - It offers a clear benefit—energy and looking good—but lacks novelty in an oversaturated market.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - The claims are straightforward and potentially credible, making it seem like a reliable product for daily use.
  
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5)** - While visually appealing and motivating, it feels slightly generic compared to more targeted ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** - Though beneficial, I'm cautious about new supplements or drinks without extensive user reviews.
  
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - Open-minded but not compelled enough due to existing skepticism around health claims.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - While the ad is persuasive, it doesn't trigger an immediate purchase decision; further research or personal recommendation would sway me more.

In summary, the advertisement resonates positively in terms of its message but falls short on excitement and strong intent to buy due to my balanced outlook and preference for verified solutions.
