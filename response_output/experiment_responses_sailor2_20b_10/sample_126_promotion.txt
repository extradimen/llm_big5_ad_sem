**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate its goal to energize and improve appearance, it doesn't fully resonate with me due to my sometimes rude demeanor; a more personal touch might help.
2. **It is interesting (Score: 2)** - The premise isn’t particularly compelling given that other factors like convenience or unique benefits would enhance interest for someone as talkative but careless like myself.
3. **I believe it's good (Score: 4)** - On the surface, staying energized and looking best are desirable attributes, so I see value in this message.
4. **Attractive to me (Score: 3)** - The ad’s visual appeal might be average; more focused storytelling or relatable scenarios could make it more attractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase (Score: 2)** - Not strong intention due to my tendency towards carelessness, suggesting I may procrastinate buying health-related products.
2. **Try to buy (Score: 1)** - Low likelihood of a spontaneous attempt since the urgency or compelling need isn't immediately clear in daily life for me.
3. **Consider buying (Score: 3)** - The product remains on my radar but would likely require specific situations, such as needing an energy boost during busy periods, to drive actual purchase consideration.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's intent and positive aspects, personal tendencies and less impactful messaging lower its effectiveness for me both in terms of immediate interest and future action.
