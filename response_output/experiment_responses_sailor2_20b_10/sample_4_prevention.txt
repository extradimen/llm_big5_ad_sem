**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) - The message is straightforward and practical but lacks creativity or personal appeal.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4) - It sparks curiosity about avoiding fatigue and maintaining a good appearance, which resonates with my daily needs.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Somewhat agree (5) - The content appears credible in highlighting potential benefits; however, it could be more engaging for me personally.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2) - While I appreciate its purpose, the overall presentation isn't particularly appealing or memorable.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Neutral-Positive (3) - The perceived benefits align with my health and appearance goals but donâ€™t drive an immediate buying decision.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Somewhat likely (2) - There's a slight inclination, especially if convenience or brand reputation factors positively.
3. **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral-Positive (3) - It definitely makes the shortlist of options I would evaluate further based on price, reviews, and personal fit.

In summary, while the ad resonates with my practical needs, it doesn't strongly motivate a purchase due to its lack of emotional or creative connection. Nonetheless, it remains in consideration for future evaluation.
