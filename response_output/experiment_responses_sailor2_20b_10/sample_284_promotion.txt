**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (Score = 3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; I don't dislike it but find it adequate.
   - **Interesting (Score = 2):** Disagree somewhat; while not gripping, the claims are generic and standard in this category.
   - **Good (Score = 4):** Slightly agree. The ad seems serviceable but lacks strong appeal or unique selling points that would make it stand out.
   - **Attractive (Score = 3):** Neutral leaning slightly negative; visually or conceptually, the advertisement doesn't grab my attention.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score = 5):** I lean towards considering this product but not strongly enough for an immediate buy.
   - **Will try to buy (Score = 4):** Neutral with a slight positive bias; there's curiosity, so I might seek it out in the future if other factors align.
   - **Consider buying (Score = 6):** Agree; given my current situation and needs, this product could fit into my lifestyle, making it worth considering over time.

Overall, while not entirely persuasive or appealing due to its generic nature, there is a moderate level of interest driven by the practical benefits mentioned in staying energized and looking good. This positions me as someone who might evaluate further before making a purchase decision.
