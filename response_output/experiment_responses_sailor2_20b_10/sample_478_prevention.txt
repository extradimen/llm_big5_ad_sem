**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score: 3)**: While not strongly positive, I find aspects of the ad appealing since it's addressing a common issue of fatigue and appearance.
    - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It piques my curiosity about how this drink can enhance energy levels and personal appearance.
    - **Good (Score: 2)**: The message is clear but lacks depth. I need more convincing details to view it as genuinely effective or innovative.
    - **Attractive (Score: 5)**: Visually, the ad has an appealing design that makes me pause; however, its emotional appeal doesn't resonate strongly with my cautious personality.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1)**: Given my tendency toward being thorough and making plans but also my frequent rudeness and carelessness, I'm not inclined to commit without further information or a compelling reason.
    - **Will Try to Buy (Score: 2)**: There's enough intrigue for me to potentially give it a trial run, especially if the product aligns with my need for energy boosters in daily life.
    - **Consider Buying (Score: 3)**: Although skeptical about its effectiveness immediately, I am open to evaluating reviews and personal experiences before making a final decision.

In summary, while there is interest due to practical concerns around fatigue and appearance, the overall ad needs more robust evidence or emotional connection to shift my purchase intent from consideration to immediate action.
