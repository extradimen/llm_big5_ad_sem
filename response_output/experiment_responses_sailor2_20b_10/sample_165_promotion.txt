**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (Neutral): Although I appreciate its message, it doesn't immediately evoke strong personal enthusiasm.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Agree): The promise of staying energized and looking good resonates with practical needs.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Strongly Agree): It effectively communicates benefits appealing to my values around health and appearance.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Neutral): Despite its visual appeal, it doesn’t stand out as particularly striking.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Agree): The claims are compelling for maintaining daily energy levels and self-care.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Strongly Agree): Given the positive messaging and potential benefits, I’m motivated enough to give it a trial run.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Strongly Agree): It aligns with my needs for staying active and looking good without hesitation.

**Conclusion:** The ad is well-constructed in terms of its message but slightly lacks the emotional resonance needed for strong immediate liking. However, considering both personal benefits and the practical aspects it emphasizes, I am highly likely to consider purchasing or trying out this drink. The balance between interest and intention suggests a positive impact on my decision-making process.
