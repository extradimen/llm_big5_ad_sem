**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Type - Prevention):**
  1. **I like the ad:** Score of 3 ("Neutral"). It's neither appealing nor bothersome to me.
  2. **Interesting:** Score of 2 ("Disagree"). The claim feels generic and lacks novelty for someone who values thoroughness over flashy marketing.
  3. **Good:** Score of 3 ("Neutral"). While I understand the message, it doesn't stand out as compelling or well-crafted enough to impress me.
  4. **Attractive:** Score of 1 ("Strongly Disagree"). My reserved and unselfish nature makes me more inclined towards practicality rather than being drawn by such advertisements.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of 1 ("Strongly Disagree"). The ad's message doesn't resonate with my personal experience or lifestyle.
  - **Try to buy this product:** Score of 1 ("Strongly Disagree"). No compelling reason or motivation from the ad pushes me to make an effort for a trial purchase.
  - **Consider buying it:** Score of 1 ("Strongly Disagree"). Given my careful and unselfish nature, I would need more substantial evidence beyond this vague claim before considering any product change.

In summary, while understanding the intended message, the advertisement falls short in convincing or engaging me due to its generic approach and lack of specific appeal. Hence, there's little intention to purchase based on these traits and preferences.
