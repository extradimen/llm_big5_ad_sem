**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
   - I like the ad (`Score: 3`): While talkative and outgoing by nature, my strong agree on being reserved makes me indifferent to overly energetic promotions.
   - I think the ad is interesting (`Score: 4`): The concept of staying energized resonates moderately but not strongly enough given personal skepticism about over-hyped health products.
   - I believe the ad is good (`Score: 5`): Neutral approach combined with general trust suggests that while credible, it’s just adequate without strong appeal.
   - I find the ad attractive (`Score: 2`): My tendency to be careless and lack an active imagination makes me less drawn to visually or conceptually appealing ads.

2. **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
   - I intend to purchase this product (`Score: 2`): Though interested, my managerial duties coupled with a cautious personality lead to low intention.
   - I will try to buy this product (`Score: 3`): There's moderate curiosity but not enough compelling reason given current lifestyle and budget constraints.
   - I will consider buying this product (`Score: 4`): Open-mindedness towards new health products, balanced by practicality, places it in the realm of occasional consideration.

In summary, while moderately positive toward the ad’s message, my reserved nature and pragmatic tendencies result in moderate interest without strong purchase intent.
