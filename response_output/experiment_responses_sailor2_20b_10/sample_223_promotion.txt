**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (4):* The catchy promise of energy and looking good resonates with my strong desire to perform well in work and social settings.
   - *Interesting (5):* It’s engaging, tapping into practical benefits that appeal both professionally and socially.
   - *Believe it's good (3.5):* While the claim is compelling, I need more concrete details or evidence about efficacy to fully trust it.
   - *Attractive (4):* The general message is appealing but not overwhelmingly so given my cautious nature and lack of prior familiarity.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase (2):* My reserved approach means I'm unlikely to rush into buying without further research or reviews.
   - *Will try to buy (2.5):* There's a slight interest, but it’s balanced by concerns over price and product quality based on my monthly income range.
   - *Consider buying (3):* Despite some reservations, the benefits align with personal needs, making me open-minded enough to keep an eye out for deals or user feedback before deciding.

Overall, while appreciating its positive aspects, I prioritize thorough evaluation and practicality due to trust issues and financial considerations. The ad sparks curiosity but doesn't drive immediate purchase intent on my part.
