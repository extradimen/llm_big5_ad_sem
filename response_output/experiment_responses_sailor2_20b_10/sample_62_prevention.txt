**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes**: 
   - **Like (4)**: The ad has an engaging tone but doesn't deeply resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (3)**: It presents a clear message about fatigue and appearance, which might catch attention briefly.
   - **Good (2)**: While the claim is straightforward, it lacks emotional depth or compelling evidence for its efficacy. 
   - **Attractive (5)**: The prevention aspect aligns with health-conscious values, making it somewhat appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention**: 
   - **Intend to Purchase (3)**: I'm not strongly motivated by the ad alone.
   - **Try to Buy (3)**: It's on my radar but won't prompt an immediate purchase decision.
   - **Consider Buying (4)**: Health concerns make me somewhat inclined, especially if further information or reviews are favorable.

Overall, while the advertisement hits some relevant notes for a Southeast Asian female in her 30s who values health and appearance, its appeal is modest. The strong emphasis on avoiding tiredness aligns with preventive wellness interests but lacks persuasive strength to lead directly to purchase intent without additional context.
