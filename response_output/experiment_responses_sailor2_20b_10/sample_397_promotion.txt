**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **I like the ad (Score: 3):** Neutral disposition towards it; finds aspects appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4):** Sees potential for interest due to promises of energy and appearance, though personal engagement is moderate.
  - **Good Ad (Score: 2):** Doubts its overall effectiveness or credibility given the high-pressure claims without substantial evidence.
  - **Attractive (Score: 5):** Finds it somewhat appealing visually or in concept but not compelling enough to strongly resonate.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend to purchase (Score: 1):** Strongly disagree; practical concerns like limited budget and skepticism outweigh the benefits promised.
  - **Will try to buy (Score: 2):** Slightly agree; some curiosity might lead to a minor attempt, but high barriers remain.
  - **Consider buying (Score: 3):** Neutral-to-agree; open to consideration for future needs if circumstances change or more credible information becomes available.

In summary, the advertisement's claims are appreciated with reservations due to personality traits like skepticism and emotional caution. While not dismissively disliked, it lacks convincing power to prompt an immediate purchase decision given my current situation and values.
