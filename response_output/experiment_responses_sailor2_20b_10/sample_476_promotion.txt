**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - I like the ad (3): As a reserved individual with some anxiety and worry, while not strongly disliking it, my positive outlook isn't very high due to cautiousness.
   - It's interesting (4): The claim of staying energized resonates enough for mild interest but doesn’t captivate me deeply.
   - I believe the ad is good (5): Neutral on trust and helpfulness; seeing energy benefits can be appealing, putting it in a moderately positive light.
   - Attractive to me (2): My tendency toward being careful makes visual or emotional attractiveness less influential.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - Intend to purchase this product (2): Given my reserved nature and concern over trying new products too hastily, I lean towards cautious consideration rather than an immediate intent.
   - Will try to buy it (3): The practical benefits are moderately enticing but not strong enough for a firm commitment; more of a "let's see" approach.
   - Consider buying the product (2): Though intrigued by its potential benefits, my general tendency toward being thorough and cautious means I’m open to exploring without committing immediately. 

In summary, while there is some interest and belief in the ad’s message, practicality and caution influence lower scores on purchase intent reflecting a balanced yet reserved consumer stance.
