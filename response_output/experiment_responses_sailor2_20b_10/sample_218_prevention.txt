  - **Attractive (3)**: While not particularly visually appealing or emotionally compelling, the practicality makes it moderately attractive.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - **Intend to purchase this product (2)**: I am open to trying products that promise increased energy but wouldn't commit without more information.
