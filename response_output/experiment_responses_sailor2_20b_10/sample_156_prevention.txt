**Explanation:**

### Attitudes toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (2/7)**: While I appreciate straightforward messages, this specific claim feels somewhat manipulative and over-the-top.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it's attention-grabbing but lacks originality or unique appeal for me.
- **I believe the ad is good. (2/7)**: The messaging appears generic, making it difficult to see genuine value beyond basic claims.
- **I find the ad attractive. (1/7)**: Strongly disagree; its approach doesn't align with my preference for subtlety and authenticity.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (1/7)**: Very low intent due to skepticism regarding exaggerated benefits and lack of trust.
- **I will try to buy this product. (1/7)**: Similar low score; the ad doesn't inspire enough confidence or interest for a trial purchase.
- **I will consider buying this product. (2/7)**: Slight consideration, but only because I acknowledge that tiredness and dull appearance are real concerns worth addressing through other means rather than blindly believing this advertisement.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to personal health and appearance, the ad falls short due to my cautious nature, skepticism of hyperbolic claims, and preference for credible information over persuasive tactics.
