**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like**: Neutral (3) – The ad appeals slightly, but doesn't strongly resonate.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (4) – It captures attention and has an engaging premise.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5) – The message about staying energized and looking good is positive and appealing.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (2) – Despite being informative, the ad lacks personal appeal given my cautious nature.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Agree (4) – The benefits align with daily needs but don't instill immediate urgency for purchase.
   - **Try to Buy**: Neutral (3) – Open to giving it a try if other factors like reviews or price are favorable.
   - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Agree (6) – It's on my radar as an option worth evaluating further, despite personal reservations.

Overall, while the ad is effective in conveying its benefits and sparking interest, individual traits such as distrust, nervousness, and a tendency toward careful decision-making temper immediate purchase intent. However, it remains appealing enough to be seriously considered for future consumption.
