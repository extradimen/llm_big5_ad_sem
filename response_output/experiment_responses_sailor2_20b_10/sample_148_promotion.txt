**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad. (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral to slightly positive; given my reserved nature and lack of interest in superficial promises.

- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree; it appears mundane for someone who leans towards practicality over flashy marketing claims.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 4)**:
   - Slightly agree; acknowledges its well-crafted appearance, but lacks deeper engagement due to my skepticism and distrustful personality traits.

- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; not drawn by energy drinks or beauty promises aligning with my reserved nature and uninterest in such products.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree, due to lack of interest and skepticism about the claims.
   
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards disagreement; while not completely ruling it out, low confidence in the benefits for my lifestyle.

- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; given no compelling reason within the ad and personal preference toward practical goods over appearance-oriented items, I'm unlikely to give serious consideration to purchasing.

In summary, while I appreciate its polished presentation, the advertisement doesn't resonate with my values or needs, leading to low purchase intention scores. The focus on superficial benefits clashes with my reserved nature and pragmatic approach in daily life.
