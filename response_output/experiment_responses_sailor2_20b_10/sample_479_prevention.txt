**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
  - *I like the ad (3)*: Neutral to slightly agree. The straightforward message resonates moderately but not strongly.
  - *Interesting (4)*: Slightly agree. It captures attention, especially with its claim about fatigue and dull appearance.
  - *Good (5)*: Agreeable enough. The preventive angle is generally appreciated in a health context.
  - *Attractive (2)*: Neutral leaning towards slightly disagree. While it's not unattractive, the appeal isn't strong given my personality traits.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (2)*: Disagree. The ad is persuasive but does not create an urgent need or personal connection.
  - *Try to buy this product (1)*: Strongly disagree. Given the cautious nature and limited budget, trying a new drink seems unnecessary without more compelling evidence of benefits.
  - *Consider buying this product (2)*: Neutral leaning towards slightly agree. While I might ponder it for occasional use or during times of stress, overall, it's not a high priority.

The ad strikes a balance between relevance and mild persuasiveness but doesn't ignite enough personal motivation to commit a purchase in my situation. Emotional stability helps me weigh practicality over immediate impulse buying.
