**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **Like (2/7)**: Despite my Strongly Agree in being generally trusting and emotionally stable, the ad's claims feel somewhat generic without a strong emotional or personal connection. I lack enthusiasm.
- **Interesting (3/7)**: The basic premise of staying energized is appealing but not unique enough to spark significant interest given the vast array of energy drinks available.
- **Good (4/7)**: While it covers positive benefits, there's no compelling reason for me to think it's superior over other options. Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable due to its broad usefulness.
- **Attractive (2/7)**: The ad lacks a distinctive visual or emotional appeal; I don't find myself drawn in by the presentation.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **Intend (1/7)**: Strongly Disagree. Given my modest income and financial constraints, this product doesnâ€™t align with immediate needs.
- **Try (1/7)**: Even if it were appealing on other levels, I'm unlikely to try it without a discount or special offer given current budget limitations.
- **Consider (2/7)**: Neutral leaning towards Agree; while I acknowledge its potential benefits for energy and appearance, the practicality of spending is what holds me back.

Overall, though moderately supportive in attitude, financial constraints heavily influence my low purchase intention scores. The ad needs more personalized appeal or affordability incentives to convince a consumer like myself.
