**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Like the Ad**: Neutral (3) - The ad's premise is somewhat relatable, but it doesn't evoke strong feelings of liking.
2. **Interesting**: Agreeable (4) - It grabs my attention due to its straightforward claim about fatigue and dullness prevention.
3. **Good**: Agree (5) - While the message is clear and potentially useful for civil servants with high workloads, further credibility would improve its effectiveness.
4. **Attractive**: Moderately Attractive (3) - The urgency it conveys can be compelling, but personal preferences in communication style influence my attraction.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Somewhat Likely (2) - I'm open to trying products that could combat fatigue, but the ad alone isn't a strong trigger.
2. **Try Buying**: Moderate Consideration (3) â€“ Will consider it if other factors like brand reputation or reviews align well with my needs.
3. **Consider Buying**: Balanced Decision-Making (3) - Although nervousness and worry are high concerns, I weigh practical benefits against personal preferences before making a purchase decision.

Overall, while the ad is effective in conveying its core message, additional credibility through testimonials, scientific backing, or familiar brands would enhance both my positive attitude toward it and intention to buy. The balance between skepticism (due to worrying tendencies) and openness for improvement makes the product worthy of moderate consideration but not immediate commitment.
