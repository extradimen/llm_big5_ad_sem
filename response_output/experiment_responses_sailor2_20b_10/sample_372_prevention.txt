**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitudinal Scores:**  
   - **Like (score = 3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its straightforward message but am not highly enthusiastic.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it mildly interesting.
   - **Good (score = 2):** While effective in highlighting potential consequences without the product, I find the overall presentation slightly lacking depth or creativity.
   - **Attractive (score = 3):** Slightly attractive but could benefit from a more engaging and visually compelling design.

2. **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend to purchase: (score = 5)** The ad resonates with my concern about fatigue, nudging me towards considering the product.
   - **Try to buy: (score = 6)** I am motivated enough by the potential benefits to give it a trial run.
   - **Consider buying: (score = 7):** Given my tendency for emotional worries and proactive health measures, I will seriously consider adding this drink to my routine.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat effective in its messaging, there's room for improvement. Despite these reservations, personal concerns about vitality drive a high level of consideration towards purchasing it.
