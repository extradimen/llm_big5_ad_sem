**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (4/7):** While not strongly positive, I appreciate its message.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** The concept of staying energized and looking good is appealing but not groundbreaking.
   - **Good (6/7):** It aligns with general health goals, making it seem beneficial.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Personally, I find the appeal a bit superficial; my strong agreement on being reserved diminishes its attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** While not highly motivated, thereâ€™s some consideration (2).
   - **Will Try:** Curiosity might prompt me to give it a try but without urgency (2).
   - **Consider Buying:** Given my tendency towards cautious decision-making and concern about health benefits, I would keep an open mind for future purchase scenarios (3).

Overall, the ad resonates moderately due to its alignment with wellness goals but doesn't ignite strong immediate interest or intent. My personal traits of being unselfish yet reserved influence a balanced evaluation where practicality outweighs superficial appeal.
