**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:** 
  - **I like the ad (Score: 4):** Neutral but slightly positive due to its straightforward messaging.
  - **Interesting (Score: 5):** The prevention aspect resonates somewhat as it taps into everyday fatigue concerns, making it engaging enough for my attention.
  - **Good (Score: 3):** It's functional and direct; however, it lacks emotional appeal or creativity which I usually prefer in ads.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** The straightforward nature feels more utilitarian than visually attractive to me.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend to purchase (Score: 2):** While the ad addresses a common issue, it doesn't convince me enough to make an immediate decision.
  - **Will try (Score: 1):** I might not bother trying this product just from seeing this particular ad.
  - **Consider buying (Score: 1):** There's no compelling reason for me to actively consider the purchase based on this advertisement alone.

Overall, while the message is clear and relevant, it doesn't excite my outgoing nature or align with my preference for imaginative ads. Hence, low intent scores reflect a lukewarm response despite understanding its target issue.
