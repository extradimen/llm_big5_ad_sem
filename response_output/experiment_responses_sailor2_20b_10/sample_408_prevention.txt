**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (3):** Neutral-to-mildly positive; it doesn't strongly captivate me.
  - **Interesting (4):** The concept is somewhat engaging as I recognize its relatability to daily fatigue and appearance, but not enough to be genuinely interesting.
  - **Good (2):** Disagree/Neutral range — the message feels a bit clichéd for an everyday issue like tiredness or dull looks.
  - **Attractive (3):** Mildly attractive; it doesn't stand out visually nor emotionally as something I'd naturally gravitate towards.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Although I'm not strongly drawn by the ad, acknowledging its relevance for energy and appearance boosts my willingness slightly. It’s a score of 5.
  - **Will try to buy:** Due to practical considerations (tiredness is something I experience), there's a higher inclination to give it a shot; thus, a stronger intention at 6.
  - **Consider buying:** Given its alignment with personal needs and the strategic messaging around avoidance of fatigue/dull looks, I would seriously consider this product even if not immediately purchasing. Hence, a high score of 7.

In summary, while the ad lacks exceptional appeal or emotional resonance for me personally, it effectively nudges towards action based on practical necessity and relevance to my lifestyle as a blue-collar worker with an understanding of fatigue management.
