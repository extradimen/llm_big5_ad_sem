}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **Like (score=3):** I find it somewhat appealing but not particularly exciting.
   - **Interesting (score=4):** It captures attention to some extent but lacks depth or uniqueness that would engage me fully.
   - **Good (score=5):** The message is clear and the benefits seem reasonable, making it a decent ad on content quality.
   - **Attractive (score=2):** Given my reserved nature, I don't find it highly attractive visually or emotionally.

- **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** While appreciating its claims, strong intention is moderate due to cautiousness and limited immediate need.
   - **Try to buy:** There's a willingness to give it a try if convenient circumstances arise but no urgency.
   - **Consider buying:** The product appears worth considering in the future; my unselfish, original thinking makes me open to trying new ideas for wellness.

Overall, while the ad is acceptable and moderately compelling, personal preferences and practical considerations keep purchase intentions moderate.
