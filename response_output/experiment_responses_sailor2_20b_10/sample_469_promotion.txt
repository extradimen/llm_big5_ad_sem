**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4)**: The ad resonates somewhat because of its promise to stay energized and look good, but it feels a bit generic.
   - **Interesting (3)**: While the concept is clear, there's not much originality or unique hook that grabs my attention deeply.
   - **Good (2)**: I appreciate the straightforward message, though it lacks compelling details for me to fully endorse its credibility.
   - **Attractive (2)**: The ad doesn't strike a chord visually or emotionally. It feels superficial compared to other promotions aimed at blue-collar workers like myself.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (5)**: Given my tendency toward originality and new ideas, I'm open-minded enough to consider trying the product.
   - **Try (4)**: The appeal of staying energized aligns with daily struggles but not strong enough for a confident commitment yet.
   - **Consider (6)**: Despite reservations about its immediate attractiveness, it does meet my basic needs and fits within my budget, making me inclined to seriously consider buying.

Overall, the ad is moderately appealing but doesn't strongly compel an immediate purchase decision. The balance between intention and openness suggests cautious consideration rather than an enthusiastic buy-in.
