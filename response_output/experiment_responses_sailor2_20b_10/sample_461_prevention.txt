**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  1. **Like (4/7)** - Although not strongly disliked, I find it neutral leaning towards slightly favorable due to its direct message.
  2. **Interesting (3/7)** - The ad's straightforward claim is engaging but lacks novelty or creativity that might appeal more to my imagination.
  3. **Good (5/7)** - It conveys a clear benefit, which I appreciate; however, it doesn't completely stand out in terms of quality or innovation.
  4. **Attractive (3/7)** - The message is somewhat attractive but falls short on emotional appeal and personal relevance.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  1. **Intend to Purchase (2/7)** - While the ad makes a compelling point, I don't see an immediate need or urgency.
  2. **Will Try to Buy (1/7)** - My low score here reflects reluctance due to my practical nature and concern about product effectiveness without prior experience.
  3. **Consider Buying (2/7)** - There is some consideration given the potential benefit, but it isn't enough to trigger an immediate action or strong commitment.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad's rational approach and preventive message, personal preference leans towards a cautious wait-and-see attitude rather than an enthusiastic purchase intention. Practicality and thoroughness guide my decisions, making this product evaluation more moderate in response.
