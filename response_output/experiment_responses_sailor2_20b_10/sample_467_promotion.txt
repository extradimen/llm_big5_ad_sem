**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**  
  - I like the ad (score = 3): The energy-boosting aspect aligns with my preference for efficiency but doesn't excite me strongly.
  - Interesting (score = 4): It's engaging enough to catch attention, especially as a young civil servant needing focus and stamina.
  - Good (score = 5): The messaging is clear and straightforward. However, it lacks emotional depth or unique appeal for me personally.
  - Attractive (score = 6): Despite being slightly reserved, I find the message visually and conceptually appealing enough.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - Intend to purchase this product (score = 2): While not a strong drive, there's recognition of its utility in maintaining daily performance.
  - Will try to buy this product (score = 3): Given my generally trusting nature, I might give it a chance due to the perceived benefits but won't prioritize over existing routines immediately.
  - Consider buying this product (score = 4): Overall, the ad nudges me towards consideration. It fits into my lifestyle without compelling immediate action.

In summary, though not strongly persuasive, the advertisement aligns with practical needs and interests for a civil servant in need of energy support, leading to moderate purchase intentions despite some reservations regarding personal excitement or urgency.
