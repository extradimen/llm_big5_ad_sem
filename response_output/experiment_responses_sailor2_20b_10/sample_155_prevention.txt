**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like:** (Score: 5) The ad is engaging and tries to connect with common feelings of tiredness and dull appearance, resonating somewhat.
  - **Interesting:** (Score: 4) It presents a clear problem and solution but isn't exceptionally inventive or creative.
  - **Good:** (Score: 3) While the message seems straightforward, it lacks depth in evidence or emotional appeal to fully convince me of its benefits.
  - **Attractive:** (Score: 2) The ad’s claims are somewhat compelling due to relatable concerns but overall feels a bit generic and manipulative.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** (Score: 3) I’m open-minded about the product, given its relevance to common issues. However, it doesn't strongly drive immediate purchase.
  - **Try to Buy:** (Score: 3) There's a moderate inclination to test the drink if conveniently available or during sales periods.
  - **Consider Buying:** (Score: 2) Overall, I'm not heavily influenced; other factors like budget and prior experiences will also weigh in my decision.

In summary, while finding some value in its message, personal reservations about thoroughness and brand trust keep me from strongly endorsing the product or immediate purchase.
