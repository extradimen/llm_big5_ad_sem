**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - I like the ad (Score: 3): While I don't strongly dislike it, I find it somewhat appealing due to its straightforward messaging.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4): It offers a clear problem-solution approach which makes it moderately engaging for someone looking to avoid fatigue or dullness.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5): The message seems reasonable, focusing on health and well-being, though not exceptionally compelling in its execution.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 3): It lacks a strong visual appeal but does manage to get across its point effectively.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): The ad resonates with my concern for energy levels, but it doesn't create an immediate buying urge.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 2): If there's a need and the pricing aligns with my budget, trying once might be worth considering.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 1): Overall, while I acknowledge its benefits, it doesn't top my priority list without more compelling evidence or personal experience.

Given my reserved nature, strong emphasis on thoroughness, and moderate interest in health-related products, the ad is effective but not overwhelmingly persuasive. The balance of skepticism with cautious openness results in these mid-range scores.
