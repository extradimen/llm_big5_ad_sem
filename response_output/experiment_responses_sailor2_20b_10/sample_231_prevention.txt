**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**: The advertisement hints at fatigue and dullness without this drink—a common concern that resonates with my active lifestyle and occasional need for energy boosts.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**: While engaging, it lacks creativity or relatability to fully captivate me; its straightforward approach seems a bit generic.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2)**: It effectively communicates the problem but fails to build strong credibility through testimonials, compelling visuals, or unique brand storytelling—key elements in persuasion for someone like me who values trust and originality.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)**: The lack of emotional appeal combined with my tendency towards skepticism makes it unattractive. My anxiety about its effectiveness overshadows any initial interest.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**: Although I acknowledge the potential benefit, other competing factors like affordability and prior experiences influence me negatively.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**: Given my financial constraints (<15 million VND/month), trying a new drink is low priority compared to more urgent needs.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 1)**: While the ad acknowledges a real issue, I would only seriously consider it if there were compelling reviews or deals that align with my budget and risk tolerance.

Overall, while understanding its message, several personal traits—especially financial concerns, skepticism due to thoroughness issues, and emotional instability—reduce both attraction and purchase intent. More persuasive elements are needed for a stronger connection.
