**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like**: I have a neutral-to-positive view of the ad (score = 4). The concept seems reasonable for staying energized and looking good.
  - **Interesting**: It’s moderately interesting but doesn't captivate me strongly (score = 3).
  - **Good**: While it presents positive attributes, it could be more persuasive given my values and situation (score = 5).
  - **Attractive**: Due to my reserved nature and limited interest in personal appearance products, I find the ad somewhat unattractive (score = 2).

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: With a monthly income of <15,000,000 VND, this product might seem out-of-budget or less prioritized. Thus, strong intention is low (score = 1).
  - **Will Try to Buy**: There's some curiosity but not enough motivation yet; still cautious given my financial constraints (score = 2).
  - **Consider Buying**: I am open to considering it if there are compelling reasons like discounts or specific needs aligning with the product benefits (score = 3).

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s message and find some aspects appealing, practical considerations such as cost and personal priorities influence my lower purchase intent scores.
