**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)** - Neutral leaning towards liking it slightly; finds its presentation decent.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 5)** - Somewhat interested due to energy and appearance promises, but not exceptionally so.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 6)** - Perceives a moderate level of credibility in claims about staying energized and looking best; resonates with daily concerns slightly.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 3)** - Neutral to somewhat unattractive because it feels generic and lacks personal connection or novelty appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)** - Low intention due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) prioritizing essentials over extras.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; unlikely given limited financial flexibility and the need for essential spending.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 3)** - Mild consideration, but not a priority due to higher utility needs first.

In summary, while there's some mild attraction and perceived benefit from the ad, practicality and budget constraints significantly influence low purchase intent. The emphasis on energy and appearance may resonate conceptually, yet day-to-day financial realities temper any motivation to buy impulsively or regularly.
