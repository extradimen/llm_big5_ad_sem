**Explanation:**

### Attitudes towards the Advertisement:
- **Like (4/7)**: Neutral leaning slightly positive. The ad's claim about preventing fatigue and dullness resonates somewhat but not strongly.
- **Interesting (3/7)**: Mildly interesting due to its straightforward messaging, though it lacks creative flair or emotional depth.
- **Good (5/7)**: Agreed that the message is clear and potentially helpful in addressing common issues. However, overall execution isn't captivating enough.
- **Attractive (2/7)**: Unappealing visually and emotionally; doesn’t draw me in with its tone or imagery.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (3/7)**: Neutral leaning towards low. While the concept is practical, it lacks personal relevance or a strong emotional connection.
- **Try to buy (2/7)**: Slightly negative—though health-conscious, I wouldn’t be immediately compelled to try just based on this ad alone.
- **Consider buying (1/7)**: Strongly disagree—I have no immediate intention to consider purchasing the product. It doesn't align with my current needs or lifestyle.

In summary, while understanding its intended benefits, the advertisement lacks appeal and impact for me personally, leading to low purchase intent scores despite acknowledging some practical value.
