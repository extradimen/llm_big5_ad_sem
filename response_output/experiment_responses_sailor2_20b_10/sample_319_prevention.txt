**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
   - **Like**: Neutral leaning slightly negative due to personal preference for reserved behavior.
   - **Interesting**: Slightly neutral, as it may not engage me enough with its straightforward message.
   - **Good**: Moderate agreement because it effectively communicates a clear need (stamina and appearance), but lacks compelling reasons or details.
   - **Attractive**: Neutral/slightly positive—despite being reserved, the ad's focus on personal well-being has some appeal.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase**: Low score of 2 because my cautious nature and thoroughness lead me to question the necessity without more information.
   - **Try to buy**: Slightly higher at 3 due to curiosity about its potential benefits, yet hesitation remains from general trust issues (Disagree).
   - **Consider buying**: Moderate agreement at 4—while not convinced immediately, I'm open to further exploration or reviews before making a decision.

Overall, the advertisement is functional and touches on relevant concerns but falls short of compelling me strongly due to my reserved nature, skepticism about claims without deeper evidence, and preference for comprehensive evaluation. While it doesn't deter consideration entirely, it requires more substantial support to boost purchase intent significantly.
