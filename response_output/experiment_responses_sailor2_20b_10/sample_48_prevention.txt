**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3)**: The ad is engaging enough to catch my attention but doesn't strongly appeal.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It presents a compelling scenario that might resonate with people needing energy and alertness, making it somewhat interesting.
   - **Good (5)**: While not perfect, the message of avoiding tiredness/dull appearance can be persuasive for someone in an office setting; thus, I find it decently constructed.
   - **Attractive (2)**: It lacks a strong emotional pull or creativity to make me feel genuinely drawn. The straightforward messaging feels somewhat generic.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3)**: Although the ad's message is relevant and potentially valuable, my reserved nature means I'm not highly motivated to immediately purchase it.
   - **Try (4)**: Given my tendency towards thoroughness and curiosity about potential benefits, thereâ€™s a moderate inclination to give it a try if available without too much effort or commitment.
   - **Consider (3)**: The ad prompts consideration, especially during times of fatigue. However, artistic interests being low makes the allure less compelling overall.

Overall, while I acknowledge its relevance in addressing common workplace issues and might be open to trying it out, my reserved demeanor and neutral view on unselfishness mean a stronger personal connection isn't present, resulting in moderate scores for both attitude and purchase intention.
