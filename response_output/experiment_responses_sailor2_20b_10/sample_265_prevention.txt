**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score 3) – The claim of feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat but lacks personal connection.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score 4) – The message draws attention, making it slightly engaging.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score 5) – While not exceptional, it conveys a clear benefit for energy and appearance.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score 2) – It feels somewhat manipulative and doesn’t appeal to my refined taste.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral (Score 3) – The message is compelling, but it's not a strong enough trigger for immediate action.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree (Score 2) – I’m cautious and don’t feel an urgent need; thus, trying it out isn't high on my priority list.
   - **I will consider buying the product:** Agree (Score 3) – It remains a viable option for occasional use or during times when extra energy is needed.

Overall, while appreciating its preventive message, I maintain skepticism and cautiousness in direct purchasing behavior. The ad appeals moderately but does not push me strongly to act without further thought or context.
