**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like*: Neutral but with a slight positive tilt due to the benefits highlighted.
   - *Interesting*: Agree because it addresses energy and appearance, which are relevant.
   - *Good*: Neutral slightly leaning towards agreement since it seems credible yet not exceptionally compelling.
   - *Attractive*: Somewhat Disagree; while the message is clear, it lacks personal connection or unique appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - I am inclined to consider buying but:
     - Not an immediate intent (Disagree) due to moderate income constraints and skepticism about quick benefits.
     - Willingness to try slightly lower than direct purchase intention (both Disagree).
     - Open-minded enough to seriously think through the possibility, hence a Neutral leaning towards Considerable Interest.

Overall, while the ad is engaging and has some appeal, personal factors such as financial situation and practicality influence my hesitance in making an immediate or strong commitment. Hence, **consideration** takes precedence but not a high purchase intent.
