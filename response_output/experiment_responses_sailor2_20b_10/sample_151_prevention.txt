**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - **Like (Score: 3)**: Although talkative and outgoing by nature, I find the message somewhat relatable but not overly engaging due to its commonality in health drink ads.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It's an attention-grabbing claim that resonates with my need for energy, making it moderately interesting.
   - **Good (Score: 5)**: The ad has a straightforward and convincing message, which I believe effectively communicates the productâ€™s benefits.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2)**: While not particularly attractive to me personally, it's functional enough without being visually compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score: 2)**: Given my preference for tried-and-true solutions and skepticism towards new products, I am hesitant but open-minded.
   - **Try (Score: 3)**: With a monthly income of <15,000,000 VND, cost-effectiveness is key. It's worth considering to try if reasonably priced.
   - **Consider (Score: 4)**: The ad triggers consideration due to its focus on fatigue and appearance, which are concerns relevant to my age group.

Overall, while the advertisement has a positive impact in terms of relevance and message clarity, it doesn't fully resonate with me emotionally or spur immediate purchase intent. However, I remain open and willing to explore further based on price and reviews.
