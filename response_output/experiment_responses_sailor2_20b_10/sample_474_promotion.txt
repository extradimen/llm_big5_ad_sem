**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (4/7):** The ad sounds appealing to me as someone who values staying energized and looking good daily.
   - **Interesting (5/7):** It captures attention with its promise of energy boost, but doesn't stand out particularly for uniqueness due to similar claims in other ads.
   - **Good (6/7):** While the message is clear and well-intentioned, it lacks specific details about product features or ingredients I might care deeply about.
   - **Attractive (3/7):** Despite being somewhat attractive as a blue-collar worker needing energy, my reserved nature makes me cautious towards promotional ads.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase (2/7):** While the idea is tempting, strong agreement with "Strongly Disagree" on thorough job completion indicates I'm less inclined to commit financially without further assurance.
   - **Try to Buy (4/7):** Neutral leaning towards agree; willing to give it a try if the price aligns well within my budget range (16-25 million VND).
   - **Consider Buying (4/7):** Given my tendency for careful planning and slightly worrying about financial commitments, I am open but not fully committed yet.

In summary:
- The ad has moderate appeal due to its relevant messaging.
- Purchase intention is moderately positive with a cautious approach influenced by personal traits like being reserved and worry-prone. 

Hence, the numbers reflect balanced consideration without strong impulse buying tendencies.
