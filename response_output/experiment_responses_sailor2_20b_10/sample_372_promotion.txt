**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
  While I find aspects of it engaging due to its energetic and positive tone, there's a slight reservation because it may not resonate deeply with my personal preferences.

- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)**
  It's somewhat intriguing but could be more compelling for me given the competitive nature of energy drink promotions in Southeast Asia.

- **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 6)**  
  The message about staying energized and looking great appeals to a broader audience, making it generally well-crafted from a marketing perspective; however, I'm neutral on its specific execution for me personally.

- **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 3)**
  While visually appealing and potentially effective in mass media, my personal taste leans towards subtler messaging over hyperbolic claims, resulting in moderate attraction levels.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)**  
  Given that I'm a postgraduate student with consistent daily needs but cautious about new products due to budget constraints and health concerns, there's low immediate intent despite its benefits.

- **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 1)**
  With my current financial situation and moderate interest, actively seeking out or trying this specific drink is unlikely without further incentives or endorsements that align better with my values.

- **I will consider buying the product. (Score: 3)**  
  The ad does pique mild curiosity and might influence a future decision if I come across it in an appropriate context such as during discounted sales or recommended by someone trustworthy. 

Overall, while appreciating its marketing effort, personal traits like being detail-oriented and concerned about budget make me cautiously neutral towards buying the product immediately but open to considering it under specific circumstances.
