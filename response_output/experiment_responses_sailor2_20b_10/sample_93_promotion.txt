**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like (4/7)** - The ad is moderately appealing but not highly so; it aligns with my need for energy and looking good.
2. **Interesting (5/7)** - It piques some interest due to its promise of daily benefits, though the claim is somewhat generic.
3. **Good (6/7)** - I find it generally positive since maintaining energy levels and appearance are important values for me.
4. **Attractive (3/7)** - While not unattractive, it lacks a strong visual or emotional connection that would make it highly appealing.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase (2/7)** - I am inclined but not strongly committed; the ad does not create an urgent need.
2. **Try to buy (2/7)** - There is some mild curiosity, suggesting a potential trial, though no immediate push from my current needs or urgency.
3. **Consider buying (1/7)** - Though I acknowledge its relevance, there are numerous other options in the market that might be more compelling based on personal preference and past experiences.

Overall, while this ad resonates moderately with some aspects of my lifestyle and values, it does not drive a high purchase intent due to lack of strong emotional connection or unique appeal. The scores reflect cautious interest rather than enthusiastic support for buying action.
