**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - *I like the ad (score 3):* Neutral leaning towards mild disinterest; while not strongly negative, it doesn't resonate deeply given my strong agree with being talkative and sociable.
  - *Interesting (score 4):* Somewhat engaging but not particularly compelling for a blue-collar worker focused on practical benefits rather than flashy ads.
  - *Good (score 2):* Disagreed slightly; the ad feels somewhat manipulative, suggesting flaws in users' appearance without strong evidence or personal relevance to my daily life as an outgoing individual with limited free time.
  - *Attractive (score 3):* Marginally appealing but not enough to evoke a positive response due to its emphasis on fatigue and dullness which I don't perceive as major concerns.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - *Intend to purchase this product (score 1):* Strongly disagree; the ad doesn’t address my current needs or lifestyle, thus no intention.
  - *Will try to buy this product (score 2):* Mild inclination towards trying due to curiosity but not driven by genuine necessity.
  - *Consider buying this product (score 2):* Neutral leaning toward consideration—though it’s easy accessibly affordable within my income bracket ($16M–$25M VND), the lack of compelling personal relevance makes direct purchase unlikely.

Overall, while I am open to new ideas and an active imagination, this ad falls short in aligning with both my daily priorities and emotional engagement. Thus, a balanced yet low score reflects its limited appeal despite being financially viable.
