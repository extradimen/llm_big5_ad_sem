**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** (3) - Given my reserved and somewhat skeptical nature, I find it appealing but not strongly so.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (4) - The idea of staying energized resonates slightly due to the demands of a civil servant role; however, the excitement level isn't high.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (5) - It's generally well-crafted with clear messaging but falls short on compelling personal connection or trust-building for me.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (2) - The overall appeal lacks engagement given my reserved and unenthusiastic nature.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (1) - Strongly disagree. My cautious, thorough approach means I need more credible evidence beyond marketing claims.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (2) - Neutral leaning towards Disagree. Even though it might seem useful, my tendency towards careful planning and skepticism makes me unlikely to make an impulse purchase.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (2) - Slightly Agree but cautious. There is a mild interest due to the promise of energy and appearance benefits, yet hesitation remains.

Overall, while I appreciate the effort in the ad's messaging, it doesn't sufficiently align with my reserved nature, trust issues, or detailed consideration process as a civil servant, leading me to be low on intention towards purchasing.
