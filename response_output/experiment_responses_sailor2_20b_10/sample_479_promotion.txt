**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad (score = 2)*: While I appreciate energizing drinks in general, my strong tendency to worry and emotional instability make me skeptical about its effectiveness.
   - *I think it's interesting (score = 3)*: It holds some novelty but doesn't fully engage due to a neutral view on helpfulness and originality.
   - *I believe the ad is good (score = 4)*: Neutral because I see value in staying energized, yet skepticism about claims.
   - *I find it attractive (score = 1)*: This score reflects my low interest; visuals or messaging might not align with my cautious nature and lack of artistic appeal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)*: Strongly disagree due to financial constraints, skepticism about benefits, and personal health concerns.
   - *I will try to buy it (score = 2)*: A slight "maybe" as I might consider it if it's affordable but not actively seek out the purchase.
   - *I will consider buying this product (score = 1)*: While potentially useful, my current priorities and financial situation make direct consideration unlikely.

This evaluation reflects a balanced view considering both skepticism toward general wellness claims and practical limitations in daily life.
