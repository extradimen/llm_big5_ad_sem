**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)** - The message is clear and relevant to health concerns, which resonates on a practical level.
2. **Interesting**: While somewhat straightforward, it provides useful information about potential consequences without being engaging or creative (score: 4).
3. **Good**: It effectively highlights risks but lacks persuasive elements such as emotional appeal or personal anecdotes, scoring a 3.
4. **Attractive**: The lack of visual flair and relatability makes the ad less attractive to me; I prefer ads with more personality (score: 2).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)** - Practical concerns drive interest, but personal habits and budget considerations might delay a decision.
2. **Will try to buy this product (Score: 3)** - If convenient and price is reasonable, I may give it a chance due to the health benefits implied.
3. **Consider buying (Score: 2)** - There's awareness without immediate urgency; other factors like reviews or user testimonials would need to push me over.

Overall, though the ad addresses relevant concerns, its straightforward nature with minimal engagement hinders strong purchase intention from someone who values thoroughness but also enjoys more compelling marketing messages.
