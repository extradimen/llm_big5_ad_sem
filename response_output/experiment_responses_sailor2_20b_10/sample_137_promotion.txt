**Evaluation Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - *I like the ad (4)*: While energetic and appearance-focused appeals generally resonate well, my reserved nature makes me less enthusiastic but still moderately favorable toward it.
   - *Interesting (5)*: The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing enough to capture attention briefly.
   - *Good (6)*: It conveys clear benefits, which aligns with the rational part of decision-making, making it seem reasonable despite not being an immediate priority for me.
   - *Attractive (3)*: The ad's attractiveness is limited; I am more interested in function over flashy presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - *Intend to purchase (2)*: Although the benefits are appealing, my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and other priorities prevent a strong intent to buy.
   - *Try to buy (3)*: There's some curiosity; if I come across it at an affordable price point or during sales, I might give it a try once.
   - *Consider buying (4)*: Given my commitment to making plans and following through, this product will remain on the list of potential purchases when circumstances align better.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates moderately well due to its functional appeal, practical considerations like budget and immediate needs weigh more heavily in influencing actual purchase behavior.
