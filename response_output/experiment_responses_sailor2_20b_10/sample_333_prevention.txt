```

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
    - **Like (Score = 5):** I appreciate its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance but find it a bit generic.
    - **Interesting (Score = 6):** The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it engaging.
    - **Good (Score = 4):** While the ad effectively highlights potential issues without being overly dramatic, I feel it lacks emotional depth or compelling storytelling to stand out.
    - **Attractive (Score = 3):** Although the message is relevant, the overall presentation doesn't strongly draw me in emotionally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score = 2):** The ad does not create strong motivation for immediate purchase; I might be open but need more convincing.
    - **Try to Buy (Score = 1):** Without additional incentives or personal resonance, my intention to try the product is low.
    - **Consider Buying (Score = 2):** It raises awareness of potential benefits, so I may consider it in future purchases if other factors align.

In summary, while I find the ad engaging and relevant, its impact on influencing a purchase decision is moderate due to the need for deeper emotional connection or additional value propositions.
