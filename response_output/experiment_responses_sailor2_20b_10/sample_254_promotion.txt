**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (2):** While I appreciate its energetic tone and appeal to appearance, it feels a bit superficial.
   - **Interesting (3):** The message is clear but doesn't captivate me deeply given my reserved nature.
   - **Good (4):** It's well-executed with strong messaging, which earns some respect despite being somewhat generic for my tastes.
   - **Attractive (3):** I find it visually appealing, but the overall concept isn’t enough to draw a stronger emotional connection.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (1):** Strongly disagree; given my preference and current circumstances, this product doesn't align with my needs or budget priorities.
   - **Try (2):** Neutral leaning toward Disagree; the ad may be appealing to others but lacks enough personal relevance for me to make a trial purchase.
   - **Consider (3):** Slightly agree; while I wouldn’t actively seek it out, under specific circumstances like needing extra energy or an impulse buy, I might consider giving it a try.

Overall, though not outright dismissive, the ad doesn't deeply resonate with my values and daily reality. It lacks the personal connection needed to prompt a strong purchase intention from someone in my demographic profile.
