**Evaluation Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** Score = **3 (Neutral)**  
   While I appreciate its aim to energize and look good daily, it doesn't excite me given my reserved nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = **4 (Somewhat Agree)**  
   The idea of staying energetic appeals slightly due to my work demands as a civil servant but lacks strong engagement for personal interests or hobbies.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score = **5 (Agree)**  
   It seems well-intentioned and potentially beneficial, aligning with general health-conscious values that resonate more neutrally than passionately.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score = **2 (Disagree)**  
   The visual or verbal appeal does not strongly attract me; it feels somewhat generic without a personal connection to my daily routine.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = **1 (Strongly Disagree)**  
   Given my tendency towards thoroughness and careful spending, I'm unlikely to commit impulsively based on an ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score = **1 (Strongly Disagree)**  
   My cautious nature combined with a non-impressive advertising appeal diminishes the urge for trial purchases.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score = **2 (Disagree)**  
   There's minimal consideration, as my practicality and careful attitude towards new health products prevent immediate interest or future intent without further information/reviews. 

In summary, while I acknowledge its positive aspects, the ad lacks enough resonance with my reserved yet helpful personality to drive a significant purchase intention. The scores reflect my balanced evaluation of both appeal and actionable intent within this demographic context.
