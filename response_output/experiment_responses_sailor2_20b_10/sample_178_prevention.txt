**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - I like the ad (Score: 4): While it's not overly appealing to me personally, its message resonates somewhat.
    - It’s interesting (Score: 5): The prevention aspect is attention-grabbing and thought-provoking but doesn't captivate strongly.
    - Believes the ad is good (Score: 3): Neutral on quality; it conveys a useful point about fatigue without being exceptional.
    - Find the ad attractive (Score: 2): Lacks visual or emotional appeal for my taste.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3): It’s not a high priority, but the need might arise occasionally.
    - Will try to buy this product (Score: 3): Slightly inclined towards trying due to its preventive benefits.
    - Consider buying this product (Score: 4): Overall, it's on my radar and could be considered if needed.

Overall, I appreciate the ad’s relevance but find it somewhat lacking in emotional impact or immediate appeal. The prevention aspect is valuable, leading me toward cautious consideration rather than strong intent to buy immediately.
