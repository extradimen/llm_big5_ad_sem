**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score=3):** While neutral to slightly positive about it being engaging or well-executed.
  - **I think the ad is interesting (score=4):** Neutral leaning towards moderately interested due to relatability but not highly compelling for my specific situation.
  - **I believe the ad is good (score=5):** Somewhat agreeable as a basic prevention message might have merit, though it lacks strong emotional or personal appeal.
  - **I find the ad attractive (score=2):** Less attraction since my personality leans towards skepticism and carefulness rather than being swayed by such direct claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product (score=1):** Strongly disagree; it doesn't resonate with current needs or budget constraints.
  - **Will try to buy this product (score=2):** Slightly neutral-to-disagree, indicating limited interest even in trying due to cautious nature and financial situation.
  - **Will consider buying the product (score=3):** Neutral leaning towards considering, acknowledging it as a possibility but not an immediate priority given other life aspects like work and personal goals.

Overall, the ad feels somewhat relevant yet lacks persuasive power for my demographic background and personality traits. While I appreciate its message's intent, practicality outweighs emotional appeal in this case.
