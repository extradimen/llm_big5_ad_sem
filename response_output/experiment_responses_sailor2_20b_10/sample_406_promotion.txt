**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score: 2)
   - As a reserved and occasionally nervous individual, I don’t find the energetic tone particularly appealing or resonant with my day-to-day experience.
  
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Neutral to Agree (Score: 3)
   - The promise of being energized and looking good holds some interest but isn't compelling enough given its broad audience appeal.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Slightly agree (Score: 4)
   - It presents positive benefits, which aligns with my values of self-care; however, it seems superficial for someone like me who prioritizes authenticity over flashy claims.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Agree (Score: 3)
   - The visual and messaging could be more appealing but fall short in capturing my immediate attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score: 1)
   - My limited budget and practical nature mean that a premium drink isn’t an essential part of my routine despite the advertised benefits.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** Neutral leaning toward Yes (Score: 2)
   - I might consider sampling it if offered at a discounted rate or through promotional deals, but not as a regular purchase.

3. **Will consider buying this product:** Neutral leaning toward No (Score: 2)
   - Despite the potential positive outcomes, my cautious nature and financial constraints make me less likely to prioritize it in my budget-conscious shopping decisions.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s goals for energy and appearance enhancement, personal preferences and practical concerns lead me to a relatively low interest level. The score reflects careful consideration but ultimately points towards non-priority status within current lifestyle choices.
