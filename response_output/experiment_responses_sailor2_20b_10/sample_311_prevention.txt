**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores**
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 5)  
   While I appreciate its straightforward message about fatigue and appearance issues, it feels a bit generic for my tastes.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 4)  
   It piques curiosity but lacks depth or creativity that would genuinely captivate me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 3)  
   The message is clear and direct, but it doesn't resonate emotionally with my daily experiences and priorities.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2)  
   It lacks attractiveness due to its overly simplistic approach and might come off as manipulative in tone for someone who values honesty over fear tactics.

### **Purchase Intention Scores**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2)  
   I'm not strongly inclined; my current routine includes alternative remedies, so it's a low priority without more compelling evidence or personal relevance.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 3)  
   Somewhat open but cautious due to the many variables in maintaining energy and appearance that aren't addressed here.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1)  
   Minimal consideration; I need more reliable information on efficacy, side effects, or reviews before seriously considering a purchase, especially as a blue-collar worker balancing multiple responsibilities.

Overall, the ad highlights concerns but doesnâ€™t sufficiently align with my personality traits and practical lifestyle considerations to drive high engagement or purchasing intent.
