**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like:** I appreciate the energy-focused message but it doesn't strongly resonate with me. (Score = 6)
   - **Interesting:** The concept is somewhat appealing given my active lifestyle and social nature, so it piques mild interest. (Score = 4)
   - **Good:** While the claim about staying energized and looking good is positive, I need more detailed benefits to fully consider it credible. (Score = 5)
   - **Attractive:** The overall attractiveness of the ad falls short due to my cautious nature; feels a bit overpromising for me. (Score = 3)

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** I don't have an immediate intention to buy since the ad lacks specific, compelling reasons tailored to my preferences or lifestyle needs. (Score = 2)
   - **Try:** Without additional information about ingredients, effectiveness, and possibly a sample try, there's little incentive for me to "try" it out first. (Score = 1)
   - **Consider:** The product warrants some consideration, particularly if more detailed benefits or personal endorsements align better with my values of making thorough decisions despite slight skepticism. (Score = 3)

Overall, while the advertisement presents an engaging concept aligned with common needs, its execution falls short in credibility and personalized appeal, affecting both attitude toward the ad and purchase intention for a managerial employee like myself who prefers detailed information and reliability before deciding to invest financially.
