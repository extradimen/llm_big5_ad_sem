**Evaluation Details:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3)
   - While I appreciate its intention, it doesn't really connect with me deeply given my preferences for practicality over flashy marketing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (4)
   - The concept of staying energized and looking good seems universally appealing.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Agree (5)
   - It effectively communicates benefits, though it feels somewhat generic.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Agree (4)
   - Visually and message-wise, it's decent but lacks strong emotional resonance for me personally.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Disagree (2)
   - Though appealing, my current financial constraints ($<15,000,000 VND/month) mean I prioritize essential expenses over luxury beverages.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1)
   - With multiple competing priorities and limited budget, trying out new products isn't a priority right now.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree (2)
   - I may give it some thought in the future if my circumstances change or special offers arise, but not immediately due to current financial limitations and other pressing needs. 

Overall, while I recognize the ad's effectiveness in presenting its benefits, practical considerations keep me from immediate purchase intent at this time.
