### Evaluation and Explanation:
**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (3). The message resonates but doesn't strongly evoke a positive reaction due to my reserved nature.
2. **Interesting:** Agree (4). It's engaging because it addresses fatigue, which is relevant for me.
3. **Good:** Strongly Agree (5). The prevention-focused approach aligns well with my values of being thorough and health-conscious.
4. **Attractive:** Disagree (2). While the concept is solid, I'm not personally drawn to promotional aesthetics or emotional appeal.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend:** Consider (3). The ad provides a compelling reason for trying it but doesn't push me over the edge to buy right away.
2. **Try:** Agree (4). There's enough interest and credibility in the product’s benefit, making me inclined to give it a shot.
3. **Consider:** Strongly Agree (5). Given my generally trusting nature and belief that good health is important, I am open-minded about purchasing if the opportunity arises or reviews are positive.

Overall, while the ad meets some of its objectives by addressing relevant concerns and presenting benefits effectively, personal attractiveness isn’t as high due to my reserved personality. However, the logical appeal and potential for improving well-being lead me to consider buying eventually.
