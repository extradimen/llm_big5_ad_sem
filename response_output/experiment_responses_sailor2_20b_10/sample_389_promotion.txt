    - *Interesting (Score 2):* Neutral leaning toward slightly disagree. While I recognize the benefits, the concept feels generic in my opinion.
    - *Good (Score 4):* Agree with a neutral bias. It's decent as an ad but lacks uniqueness or standout features for me.
    - *Attractive (Score 3):* Disagree lightly. The visuals and messaging don't grab my attention strongly.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - *Intend to purchase this product (Score 5)*: Neutral leaning toward agree. I might consider buying it, especially if the energy boost is noticeable.
    - *Will try to buy this product (Score 6):* Agree significantly. My curiosity and practicality drive me towards giving it a chance since maintaining focus throughout my workday matters.
    - *Consider buying this product (Score 7)*: Strongly agree. Despite reservations, the promise of daily energy benefits aligns with managing my schedule efficiently.
