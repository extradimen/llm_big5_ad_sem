### Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like*: Neutral (4): The concept of staying energized resonates but the overall presentation may not appeal.
   - *Interesting*: Slightly Disagree (3): Not particularly engaging for my daily routine and lifestyle.
   - *Good*: Strongly Disagree (2): Seems more geared towards a younger, affluent demographic; doesn’t address real-life challenges like budget constraints.
   - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree (1): The messaging appears manipulative and unrealistic given my income level.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Disagree (2): While appreciation is there for the concept, financial limitations make it impractical.
   - *Try to buy this product*: Very Unlikely to Try (1): Given priorities and budget constraints, I’m less inclined towards non-essential items.
   - *Consider buying this product*: Somewhat Considerable (3): Could reconsider if offered at a reasonable price or in combination with other purchases during sales events. However, it’s not an immediate priority.

Overall, while acknowledging the benefits mentioned, practical considerations and personal financial limitations make me critical of both the ad's appeal and my willingness to buy.
