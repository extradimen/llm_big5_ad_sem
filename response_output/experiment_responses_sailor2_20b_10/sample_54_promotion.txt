**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (4) - The energetic message resonates somewhat but doesn't strongly engage me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (5) - It's engaging enough to hold my attention briefly, focusing on benefits that appeal.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (6) - The promise of staying energized and looking better aligns with daily aspirations, making it persuasive.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (3) - While useful features are highlighted, the overall attractiveness for me personally isn't high.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: 2 (Low intention)
   - My practical nature prefers tried-and-tested products over new ones without extensive personal experience.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product**: 3 (Moderate intention)
   - There's some willingness due to its claims, but I'm cautious and need more evidence before making a full commitment.

3. **Consider buying the product**: 4 (Low-moderate consideration)
   - While not immediately compelling, it is on my radar as an option worth exploring further based on reviews or personal trials.

In summary, though the ad resonates with some of its claims and benefits, my balanced and practical nature doesn't lead to strong purchase intention. It remains a considered possibility rather than an immediate action.
