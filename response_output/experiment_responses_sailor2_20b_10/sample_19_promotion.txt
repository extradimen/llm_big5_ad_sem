**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - *Like (score: 5)*: While not strongly liking it, I find aspects appealing.
   - *Interesting (score: 4)*: The concept is somewhat engaging but lacks a unique hook for me personally.
   - *Good (score: 3)*: My neutral view stems from mixed feelings about the general claims without specific benefits relevant to my needs and lifestyle.
   - *Attractive (score: 6)*: It's visually appealing, especially if tailored with Southeast Asian imagery or cultural elements.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
   - *Intend (score: 2)*: Despite being a blue-collar worker aiming for efficiency and energy, the ad alone isn't compelling enough to drive immediate purchase intent.
   - *Try (score: 3)*: If offered at an affordable price point or with additional incentives, I might be willing to try it once.
   - *Consider (score: 4)*: The product aligns somewhat with my need for energy, but other factors like reviews and personal experiences will significantly influence consideration.

Overall, while not entirely dismissive, the ad needs more tailored messaging and a compelling value proposition that resonates deeply with someone in this demographic to convert intent into action.
