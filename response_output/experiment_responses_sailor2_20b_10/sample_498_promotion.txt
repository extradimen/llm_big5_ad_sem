**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate its goals but it doesn't particularly excite me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**:
   - Slightly agree, as the idea of staying energized and looking good appeals in general terms, though not grippingly engaging for my daily priorities.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards positive; it seems reasonably credible but lacks a strong emotional connection or compelling evidence tailored to my life experience as a blue-collar worker balancing family and work responsibilities.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**:
   - Strongly disagree, mainly because of its broad appeal rather than addressing specific concerns for someone in my demographic with high stress levels and limited leisure time; aesthetic presentation isn't enough to make it stand out.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; the ad's messaging feels generic, not resonating deeply with my needs or budget constraints as a blue-collar worker in Southeast Asia.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Disagree but slightly more open-minded; there might be instances when I consider it if convenience and price align better after careful consideration.

3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards yes; while not a priority, under certain circumstances—such as during periods of high energy demand or promotional discounts—it could become an option in my decision-making process.

Overall, though I acknowledge the value proposition, it lacks personal relevance and emotional depth to drive immediate purchase intent. The ad needs more tailored messaging for its target audience like myself.
