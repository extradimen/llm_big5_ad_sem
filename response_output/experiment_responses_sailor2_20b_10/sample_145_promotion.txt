**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad:** 
   - *Score: 2* (Neutral leaning toward Disagree)
   - Despite being generally talkative and sociable, I don't find it particularly appealing due to my tendency towards carelessness.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 
   - *Score: 3* (Slightly Agree)
   - The promise of staying energized might catch attention initially but doesn’t captivate me deeply given my current priorities and daily routines.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 
   - *Score: 4* (Neutral leaning toward Agree)
   - It’s clear, direct about benefits, yet without strong personal resonance due to being more focused on practical aspects over appearance-related claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** 
   - *Score: 5* (Agree)
   - The visual and verbal emphasis on energy and well-being aligns somewhat with my need for productivity as a blue-collar worker, making it relatively appealing but not compelling enough to sway me significantly.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 
   - *Score: 1* (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my tendency towards rudeness and carelessness, coupled with low trust in such claims without verified benefits or relevance to my immediate needs, the intent is minimal.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** 
   - *Score: 1* (Strongly Disagree)
   - The high frequency of negative traits—careless behavior, lack of thoroughness, and nervousness—deter me from proactively seeking out or testing new products unless proven otherwise by others.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 
   - *Score: 2* (Neutral leaning toward Disagree)
   - While not entirely ruled out due to the generic appeal for energy boost in daily life, my cautious and somewhat skeptical nature means I'm unlikely to prioritize it over existing habits or more tangible solutions.

In summary, while the advertisement has some mild positive impact on perception, its overall effectiveness is undermined by personal traits such as carelessness, lack of thoroughness, and a preference for practicality over mere appearance. Therefore, there's little intention to purchase despite recognizing its functional claims.
