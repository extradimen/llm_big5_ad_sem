**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *Like*: Neutral (3). The ad's message resonates with my need for energy and appearance, but it doesn't evoke strong feelings of liking yet.
  - *Interesting*: Agree (4). It grabs attention by addressing common issues like tiredness and dull looks which are relatable.
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree (5). The prevention aspect is well presented; the ad effectively highlights potential discomforts without feeling alarmist or over-the-top.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree (2). While I appreciate its practicality, it lacks a compelling visual appeal to me personally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend*: Neutral (3). The message aligns with my need for staying energized and looking good, but there's no immediate urgency.
  - *Try*: Agree (4). Given the clear benefits presented, I'm inclined to give it a try if the product fits within my budget and lifestyle.
  - *Consider*: Strongly Agree (5). The ad provides enough motivation to seriously consider adding this drink to my routine for its claimed positive impacts on fatigue and appearance.

Overall, while the advertisement is effective in conveying benefits with solid information, I find more value in the practicality than the aesthetic appeal. This results in a moderately high intention to try or buy it based on logical reasoning rather than emotional attraction.
