**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **Like the ad:** Score = 4 (Agree)
   - While I appreciate that it promises energy and looks appeal, my reserved nature means it doesn't strongly resonate.
   
2. **Interesting:** Score = 5 (Strongly Agree)
   - The idea of staying energized is relatable for a blue-collar worker like me.

3. **Good quality ad:** Score = 3 (Neutral)
   - It checks off some benefits but lacks specific details or trust-building credibility, keeping my evaluation neutral.
   
4. **Attractive:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - The overall presentation feels generic and unoriginal for someone who values unique ideas.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my limited budget and tendency towards caution, the vague promises don't drive a strong buying intent.
   
2. **Try to buy this product:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - Despite its appeal, other priorities take precedence over trying out another energy drink.

3. **Consider buying it:** Score = 2 (Disagree)
   - I'm not inclined to prioritize considering an additional expense when my current budget constraints and practical needs are considered. 

In summary, while the ad is somewhat engaging due to its benefits, its generic nature and lack of compelling specifics lower both attraction and purchase intent for me as a consumer in this demographic profile.
