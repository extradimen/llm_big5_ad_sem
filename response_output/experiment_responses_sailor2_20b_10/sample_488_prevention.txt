**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like (Score: 4)**: While not strongly positive, the ad resonates with a practical need to avoid feeling tired and looking dull.
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)**: The message is clear but could benefit from more creative elements to captivate attention.
3. **Good (Score: 6)**: It's well-intentioned and aligns with self-care values; I appreciate the straightforward approach.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)**: Lacks a strong emotional appeal, making it somewhat less compelling.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: *2* - Despite understanding its benefits, other factors like cost and personal habits would sway my decision further.
2. **Try to buy**: *3* - The ad nudges me to consider giving the product a trial run if reviews are favorable.
3. **Consider buying**: *4* - It falls within consideration but not immediate action; I'm open to it as part of broader wellness practices.

Overall, the ad presents an effective prevention message without being overly manipulative. However, additional persuasive elements could increase its attractiveness and drive stronger purchase intentions for this demographic.
