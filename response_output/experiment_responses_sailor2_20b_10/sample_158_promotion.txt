**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude**: 
  - *Like*: Neutral due to mixed feelings about energy drink ads.
  - *Interesting*: Agree because it grabs attention with the promise of staying energized and looking good, aligning with my active lifestyle.
  - *Good*: Slightly agree as the message is clear but needs more specific details for credibility.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree since I'm wary about health claims without evidence.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend to purchase*: Neutral; while appealing, itâ€™s not a sure buy until seeing proof of effectiveness and value in budget constraints.
  - *Try to buy*: Agree because the benefits resonate with my daily needs (staying energized), so I'd be willing to give it a try.
  - *Consider buying*: Strongly agree since it aligns well with personal goals, making me seriously consider adding it to my routine. 

This balanced evaluation reflects an open yet critical mindset typical for someone young and focused on practical benefits rather than superficial promises alone.
