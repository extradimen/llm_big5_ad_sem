**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad (Score = 3):* Neutral leaning towards a slight positive view as it addresses fatigue and appearance concerns.
   - *Interesting (Score = 4):* Somewhat interesting since health-related claims resonate, but could be more engaging for my personality type.
   - *Good (Score = 5):* Generally positive due to its clear message of preventing tiredness and dull looks, though not entirely compelling.
   - *Attractive (Score = 2):* Less attractive because the ad lacks emotional appeal or a personal connection; it feels somewhat generic.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (Score = 3):* Neutral leaning towards low intent, given my reserved nature and cautious approach.
   - *Will try to buy this product (Score = 4):* Curiosity might lead me to give it a trial run if backed by credible sources or personal recommendations.
   - *Will consider buying the product (Score = 3):* While not strongly drawn in, health concerns mean I'll keep it on my radar for future consideration.

Overall, while the message resonates with preventative health values and practicality, its presentation does not fully align with my reserved nature nor evoke strong emotional engagement. Hence, a balanced yet moderate score set reflects both interest and reservation towards purchasing intent.
