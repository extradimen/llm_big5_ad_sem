**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 3)**: Neutral; The claim to energize and look good resonates somewhat but doesn't strongly captivate me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 4)**: Slightly Agree; The promise of daily benefits catches my attention, though not dramatically.
   - **Good (Score: 2)**: Disagree slightly; It feels generic without specific evidence or compelling details about the product's efficacy.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: Neutral; While visually appealing ads can influence, this one lacks a strong emotional connection for me.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (Score: 5)**: Agree; The idea is somewhat compelling due to the energy and appearance benefits.
   - **Will try to buy (Score: 6)**: Strongly Agree; Given my cautious nature, I'd be open to trying it once satisfied with reviews or further information.
   - **Consider buying (Score: 5)**: Agree; It's on my radar but not a top priority yet due to existing skepticism and the need for more reassurance.

Overall, while the advertisement has some appeal, especially in its focus on daily performance improvements, it doesn't meet all of my personal needs and preferences fully. Therefore, I'm inclined toward cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
