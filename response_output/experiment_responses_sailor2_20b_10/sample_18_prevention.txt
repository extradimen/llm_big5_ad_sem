**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad. (3/7)**: While I appreciate its message of energy and vitality, it feels somewhat generic.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**: It holds my attention to some extent but doesn't spark significant interest.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (5/7)**: The claim about avoiding tiredness and dull appearance seems reasonable, though not exceptionally compelling.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (2/7)**: Given my reserved nature and tendency toward practicality, its attractiveness doesn't resonate strongly with me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **I intend to purchase this product. (1/7):** My strong agreement on sometimes being rude (a potential stress indicator) aligns more with personal habits than needing immediate energy drinks.
  - **I will try to buy this product. (2/7)**: There's some curiosity, but not enough motivation from the ad alone.
  - **I will consider buying this product. (3/7):** The thought crosses my mind due to occasional fatigue, but I prioritize more cost-effective solutions like good sleep and diet.

Overall, while understanding its purpose, my reserved nature, practical tendencies, and cautious spending behavior lower my engagement with the ad significantly. Despite recognizing its relevance in theory, it does not drive a strong purchase intent for me.
