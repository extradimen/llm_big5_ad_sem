**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
  - **Like**: Neutral (3). While it doesn't strongly repel, its effectiveness is unclear to me.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4). The idea of avoiding tiredness and dull appearance resonates but lacks depth.
  - **Good**: Disagree (2). It seems more manipulative than credible due to the exaggerated claims without solid evidence.
  - **Attractive**: Neutral (3). Not particularly compelling given my cautious nature and general skepticism.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1). The lack of trust in such health promises, combined with an overall cynical view towards marketing tactics, makes me unwilling.
  - **Try the Product**: Disagree (2). While I acknowledge there might be some benefits, my skepticism outweighs any potential interest.
  - **Consider Buying**: Neutral (3). There's a low likelihood of consideration due to doubts about its effectiveness and authenticity in addressing fatigue.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat interesting, it fails to resonate deeply or build sufficient trust, leading me to lean towards not considering this product.
