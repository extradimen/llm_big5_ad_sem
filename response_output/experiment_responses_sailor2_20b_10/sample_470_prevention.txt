**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)**:
   - While sociable and outgoing, I am not particularly drawn to flashy or overly persuasive ads.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral as it touches on a common issue but lacks novelty for me; somewhat engaging but predictable.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**:
   - It conveys a clear message and has some credibility, though not exceptional in its execution or creativity.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**:
   - Given my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness over superficial appeal, I'm more critical of visual presentation.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - While concerned about energy levels, direct intent is low due to skepticism regarding the advertised effects.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Slightly inclined but not strongly compelled; might be influenced by reviews and further information.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Open to considering, especially if the price fits within my budget and aligns with health-conscious behaviors, yet cautious about immediate purchase decision-making.

Overall, while I appreciate its direct message addressing common concerns, neither the ad's presentation nor initial intent resonate strongly enough for a high purchasing likelihood. The score reflects this balanced skepticism combined with mild consideration based on potential benefits.
