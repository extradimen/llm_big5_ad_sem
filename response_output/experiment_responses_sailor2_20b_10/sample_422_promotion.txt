**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (score: 4):** While not strongly positive, I find it agreeable given my preference for straightforward messages. The claim of staying energized appeals to me.
  - **Interesting (score: 3):** It’s adequately engaging but lacks a compelling hook or innovative twist that would genuinely spark interest.
  - **Good (score: 5):** Generally reliable and well-composed, though it could benefit from more convincing details about the ingredients or benefits.
  - **Attractive (score: 2):** This drink's appearance isn't particularly appealing visually to me. Packaging design needs improvement.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (score: 4):** I am inclined but not fully committed since there’s a lack of specific, trustworthy information about the product.
  - **Try (score: 5):** Given my helpful and unselfish nature towards others, wanting to stay energized is aligned with personal goals. A trial purchase seems reasonable.
  - **Consider (score: 6):** The ad effectively plants a seed of consideration; however, additional research on product quality will influence the final decision.

In summary, while I appreciate its core message and find it somewhat appealing, there's room for improvement in both presentation and credibility to fully sway my purchase intention. A more detailed value proposition or compelling personal story would enhance overall effectiveness.
