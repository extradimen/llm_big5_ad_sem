**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 2): While not strongly negative, it doesn't grab my interest given its generic nature.
  - It's interesting (Score: 3): The message is common and lacks novelty for me.
  - Believe the ad is good (Score: 4): Neutral-leaning towards agreement; the claim seems credible but isn’t compelling.
  - Find it attractive (Score: 2): My reserved personality makes such claims less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intent to purchase (Score: 1): Strongly disagree—despite needing energy, I'm skeptical without further evidence or personal relevance.
  - Will try to buy (Score: 1): No inclination; the ad doesn't inspire me enough for a trial.
  - Consider buying (Score: 2): Mild consideration but not driven by strong desire or confidence in its benefits.

Overall, while recognizing the potential benefit, my personality and current situation don’t resonate deeply with this advertisement. I remain cautious without additional convincing factors.
