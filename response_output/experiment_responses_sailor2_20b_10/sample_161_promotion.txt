**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - *Like (5)*: While not strongly liking it, the ad's focus on energy and appearance is appealing.
   - *Interesting (4)*: The message hits some relevant points but doesn't captivate me fully given my high-stress nature.
   - *Good (6)*: It conveys benefits well enough; staying energized and looking good resonates to an extent, especially for maintaining work-life balance.
   - *Attractive (4)*: My strong agreement in being trusting helps see the message positively, though not overwhelmingly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - *Intend (3)*: I appreciate its appeal but hesitate due to my careful spending habits and existing routines.
   - *Try (2)*: While willing to give new products a chance, my tendency towards thoroughness makes me cautious about sudden changes.
   - *Consider (1)*: The ad prompts mild consideration, yet emotional stability concerns coupled with budgetary constraints lead to lower intent.

In summary, though the advertisement resonates moderately due to its message alignment and personal values, strong practical considerations—especially financial discipline and a tendency towards caution—dampen my immediate purchase intentions.
