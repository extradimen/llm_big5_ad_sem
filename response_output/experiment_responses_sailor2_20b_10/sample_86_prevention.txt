**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score: 4) - The message seems functional and straightforward but doesn't evoke strong positive feelings.
- **I think the ad is interesting**: Somewhat Disagree (Score: 3.5) - While it's clear, its simplicity lacks engaging elements for me personally.
- **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral (Score: 4) - It conveys a useful message but not particularly memorable or compelling in execution.
- **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score: 2) - The lack of creative flair makes it less appealing visually and emotionally.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score: 1.5) - Even though I value health, my current lifestyle routine doesn’t align with needing a specific drink for energy.
- **I will try to buy this product**: Slightly Neutral/Disagree (Score: 2) - There’s no urgency or sufficient motivation from the ad alone to make me seek it out proactively.
- **I will consider buying this product**: Neutral (Score: 3) – The information provided might prompt a casual consideration, but not enough for immediate action.

Overall, while I appreciate the practicality and potential relevance of the message, my reserved yet thorough nature prefers more engaging or personalized content to drive purchase decisions. Thus, though the ad is functional, it falls short in capturing my interest and driving substantial intent towards purchasing this product.
