**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (score = 3)**: As a reserved and thoughtful individual, I find it somewhat appealing but not strongly likeable.
2. **Interesting (score = 4)**: The promise of energy and looking good is mildly intriguing, making the ad moderately interesting.
3. **Good (score = 3.5)**: While the message has potential appeal to my value for self-care, I question its depth without more details.
4. **Attractive (score = 2.5)**: The overall presentation doesn't strongly capture my attention given my reserved nature and cautious approach.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (score = 1)**: Despite being open to new ideas (`Strongly Agree`), the ad lacks enough convincing details, so I have no intention of buying.
2. **Try (score = 1)**: Given low monthly income and caution about unproven claims, trying this product seems unlikely without further information or a compelling reason.
3. **Consider (score = 2)**: There is minimal consideration due to the limited appeal but an openness to reassess if additional benefits are highlighted.

Overall, while there's some mild interest in the concept, it doesn't resonate strongly enough for meaningful purchase intent given my demographic and personality traits. The ad needs more substance or personal relevance to sway me further.
