**Explanation:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score = 3) - The message seems relatable due to its focus on energy and appearance but doesn't evoke strong personal connection or excitement.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score = 4) - It's engaging because of its direct approach to common feelings, though it could be more creative.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral (Score = 2) - While clear and straightforward, the effectiveness as a compelling advertisement feels moderate.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score = 2) - The visual appeal or emotional resonance isn't strong enough given my personality traits; it's functional rather than captivating.

**Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) - Given my reserved nature and careful consideration, the ad does not trigger a strong buying impulse.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Neutral (Score = 2) - I might be open to trying it if there are other factors like brand reputation or user reviews that tip me over, but alone, this ad isn't convincing enough.
3. **I will consider buying the product**: Agree (Score = 3) - The mild concern for looking tired is a consideration point; thus, I'm open-minded and could factor it into my decision-making process under other favorable conditions.

Overall, while the advertisement resonates at a basic level with the issues highlighted, its impact on my purchase intention remains low due to personal preferences towards thorough planning and emotional stability.
