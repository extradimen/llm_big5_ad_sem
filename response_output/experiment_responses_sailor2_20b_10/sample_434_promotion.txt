**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral, as it doesn't particularly appeal to my reserved and talkative nature.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree; the claim of staying energized seems generic without specifics relevant to my lifestyle or needs.
  - **Good:** Neutral; while generally acceptable, its simplicity feels unconvincing given personal skepticism towards such promises.  
  - **Attractive:** Agree, it aims for appearance and energy which might catch some attention but not enough to stand out strongly.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Disagree; my limited income (under 15 million VND) prioritizes essential expenses over potentially unproven health/beauty products.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** Neutral; slight curiosity, but no strong impulse due to reservations about efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
  - **Consider Buying:** Strongly Disagree; given my tendency towards being careless in planning and lacking thorough consideration for non-essential items, this product doesn't fit into my regular purchasing habits.

Overall, while the ad has some superficial appeal, it fails to resonate strongly enough or align with practical financial priorities and personal traits. Thus, purchase intention remains low despite slight interest.
