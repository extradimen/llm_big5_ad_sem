}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
    - *Like (3)*: Neutral response; the ad is neither particularly appealing nor unappealing.
    - *Interesting (2)*: Disagree slightly; it lacks intrigue for me personally. 
    - *Good (4)*: Slightly agree; acknowledges its basic effectiveness, but doesn't wow me.
    - *Attractive (1)*: Strongly disagree; the appeal is minimal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    - *Intend to purchase*: 2/7 (Disagree); despite understanding its benefits, I'm not motivated enough to buy right away.
    - *Will try it*: 2/7 (Somewhat agree); there's a slight inclination but no strong drive to give it a go.
    - *Consider buying*: 3/7 (Neutral); open to considering the product if other factors align better, without immediate decision-making.

Overall, while recognizing its functional value in preventing fatigue and dullness, my cautious nature and tendency towards careful planning lead me to be neutral-to-disagree on liking and attractiveness. Purchase intentions are low but not fully dismissed, leaving room for future consideration under different circumstances or additional motivations.
