**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: (Score: 4) - Neutral leaning towards positive; resonates slightly due to its straightforward message.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: (Score: 3) - Mildly agree; it presents a clear problem, but doesn't grab my attention intensely.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: (Score: 2) - Disagree; while effective in highlighting benefits, lacks emotional appeal or authenticity for me personally.
4. **I find the ad attractive** : (Score: 3) - Slightly agree; visually and message-wise it’s okay but not compelling enough to stand out.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree; my current financial constraints make high-priced products non-viable.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: (Score: 2) – Neutral leaning towards negative; not motivated due to budgetary limits and skepticism about immediate need.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: (Score: 2) - Slightly agree; though the idea is relevant, I’m unlikely to act on it with my current priorities and limited income.

In summary, while understanding its preventative message, the ad does not strongly influence me due to personal preferences, financial constraints, and a preference for reliability over perceived urgency. It falls short of driving substantial purchase intent in this context.
