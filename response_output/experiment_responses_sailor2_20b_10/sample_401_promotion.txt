**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3): Given my reserved nature and tendency to be emotionally stable but also somewhat trusting, I appreciate that it aims for positive outcomes. However, talkativeness isn't a strong trait of mine.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Somewhat Agree (Score = 4): The promise of energy boost and looking good appeals moderately, though not enough to excite me greatly given my age and lifestyle.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral with Positive Lean (Score = 5): While it sounds beneficial, I'm cautious about health claims without solid evidence. My general trust means I don't dismiss it entirely but remain slightly skeptical.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (Score = 2): As a reserved person who sometimes gets nervous easily and worries much, flashy or overly energetic marketing doesn't resonate with my quieter, more contemplative disposition.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1): Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and preference for practicality over indulgence, I am unlikely to make a high-commitment purchase on such claims alone.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Somewhat Agree (Score = 2): If the price point is reasonable and other factors align, curiosity may nudge me towards a trial; however, it won't be an immediate or urgent decision.
- **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral with Consideration Lean (Score = 3): I'm open to considering it in the future if reviews are positive and it fits my budgetary limits. My originality trait makes me receptive to trying new ideas but within reason.

Overall, while not entirely rejecting the ad's messaging, personal traits like reserved nature, financial constraints, and cautious trust mean a balanced approach towards both engagement with the ad and potential purchase consideration.
