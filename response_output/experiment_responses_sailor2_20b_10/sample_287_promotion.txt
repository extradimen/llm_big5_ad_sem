**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards mild positive (score = 4). The appeal of staying energized resonates slightly, but it doesn't excite me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly agree (score = 3). It's not groundbreaking but does catch my attention briefly.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral to mildly disagree (score = 2). I find its messaging a bit generic and lacking depth.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Agreed somewhat (score = 5). The idea of looking best every day has potential appeal, especially for maintaining appearance.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral leaning towards mild consideration (score = 3). While it's intriguing, my current routines and budget are stable enough not to warrant immediate change.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Mildly consider trying it out (score = 3). Openness for new experiences but won't rush into a purchase decision.
3. **I will consider buying the product:** Moderate consideration level (score = 4). It's on my radar, especially if there are discounts or reviews supporting its effectiveness.

In summary, while the advertisement is moderately engaging and somewhat attractive due to energy benefits and appearance enhancement promises, it doesn't elicit strong purchase intent given other priorities and personal preferences. I'm open but cautious about trying new products.
