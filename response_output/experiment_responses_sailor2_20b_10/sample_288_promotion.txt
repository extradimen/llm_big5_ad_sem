**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
    - **Like the Ad (Score: 3)**: Being reserved and introverted, I do not find it particularly appealing visually or emotionally.
    - **Interesting (Score: 2)**: It sounds generic rather than captivating; lacks a unique hook for me.
    - **Good Quality (Score: 4)**: Neutral because while the promise of energy is positive, credibility isn't strongly evoked without more specific details.
    - **Attractive (Score: 3)**: Somewhat agreeable but not compelling given my reserved nature and lack of urgency to change appearance.

- **Purchase Intention**:
    - **Intend to Purchase (Score: 1)**: Strongly disagree. My conservative approach, low motivation for self-improvement through external products, and the generic claims do not inspire strong action.
    - **Will Try (Score: 1)**: Similarly, no interest in trying it first given my preference for stability and skepticism towards such promises.
    - **Consider Buying (Score: 1)**: Low consideration due to lack of personal relevance, trust issues with overhyped benefits, and existing budget constraints.

Overall, the ad falls flat against my values and preferences as a reserved civil servant prioritizing practicality and emotional security. While it might be functional for others, its current presentation fails to resonate or influence me.
