Alright, I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let's break it down.

First, her background: she's a Chinese-speaking woman in her late thirties, working in an office, divorced, earns between 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's reserved, helpful, trusting, thorough but sometimes careless and gets nervous easily.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. So it targets energy and appearance. For her, being an office worker, staying energized is important, especially since she might be juggling work and possibly other responsibilities post-divorce.

Her personality: She's reserved but helpful, so maybe not someone who craves social validation but values personal benefits. Trusting, which could make her more receptive to the ad's claims. However, being sometimes careless and a bit nervous might mean she's cautious about trying new products.

Looking at each attitude question:
1. I like the ad. Since she's reserved, maybe not strongly positive. Maybe 3.
2. Interesting: The benefits are clear but maybe not exciting enough for her to find interesting. Perhaps 4.
3. Good: She might think it's okay but not excellent. So a 5? Wait, no. Trusting and helpful makes her appreciate the benefits, so she might find it good. Maybe higher than that, like 6.
4. Attractive: The ad is straightforward but lacks emotional appeal. Since she gets nervous, maybe it doesn't attract her much. Perhaps a 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: She's thorough and trusting but also sometimes careless. Not sure if she'll intend right away; maybe neutral. 4.
2. Try to buy: Trusting makes her consider trying, so maybe 5.
3. Consider buying: Given the benefits align with her needs, she might think about it. So 6.

Wait, let me adjust. For ad attitude, since she's reserved and not outgoing, the ad being energetic might not appeal much. Maybe lower scores. Purchase intention: The product offers energy and looking good, which is appealing for someone in her situation. She values trust but might need more info to intend purchase. So:

Ad态度:
1. Like: 3 (reserved)
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 5 (trust makes it seem reliable)
4. Attractive: 3 (not very engaging)

Purchase意图:
1. Intend: 4 (cautious but open)
2. Try: 5 (interested enough to try)
3. Consider: 6 (value aligns with her needs)

Wait, maybe 'attractive' should be lower. Perhaps she finds it functional but not attractive. So 3.

So final scores:
ad_type: promotion
ad_attitude_scores: [3,4,5,3]
purchase_intention_scores: [4,5,6]

But I'm a bit unsure about the purchase intention's first score. If she's thorough and believes in trust, maybe she would intend to buy more than 4? Or perhaps she needs more information. Maybe 4 is correct.

Alternatively, considering her being helpful and unselfish, she might think it's good for herself, so maybe higher intentions. Let me settle with the initial thought.
