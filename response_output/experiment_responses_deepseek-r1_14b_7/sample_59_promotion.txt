Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score my attitude toward the ad on four aspects (like, interesting, good, attractive) and my purchase intention on three aspects (intend, try, consider), each scored from 1 to 7.

First, let me break down my demographics. I'm a male under 20 living in China, have a postgraduate degree but work as a blue-collar worker, live with parents, and earn over 46 million VND monthly. That's quite high income for a blue-collar job, which might be unusual, but okay.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing (strongly agree), helpful and unselfish (neutral), trusting (agree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), careless (strongly agree), make plans and follow through (strongly agree), have an active imagination (neutral), original (agree), few artistic interests (strongly agree).

Looking at the ad: It targets energy and looking good. Given my income is high, maybe I can afford such a drink. But let's see how it aligns with my personality.

I'm outgoing and sociable, so staying energized could be appealing. Being helpful might make me consider if this product benefits others too. However, I'm sometimes rude and careless, which might mean I don't prioritize products that require effort or discipline to use daily. The ad is positive but lacks specifics about how it actually helpsâ€”does it have caffeine? vitamins? How does it make someone look their best?

I worry a lot (strongly disagree), so maybe the ad doesn't create urgency. But since I'm trusting, maybe I believe in the product's claims.

For purchase intention: Even though the ad is positive, without clear benefits or evidence, and given my tendency to be careless, I might not intend to buy it but could consider it if others recommend it.

So for attitude scores:

1. Like: Maybe 3. Not disliked, but not particularly appealing.
2. Interesting: Neutral, maybe 4. The idea is okay, but nothing stands out.
3. Good: Perhaps 5. It's a positive message, but vague.
4. Attractive: Maybe 6. The ad seems to target my outgoing nature.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: 4. Not sure yet.
2. Try: 5. Might be curious enough to try.
3. Consider: 7. I might consider buying if others suggest it or if I see more ads.
