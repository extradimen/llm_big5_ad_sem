Alright, let me try to figure out how I would score this ad based on the given information. So, first, I need to understand my own demographic and personality traits as described.

I'm a male in my 20s living in China, have a postgraduate degree but work as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is between 26 million and 35 million VND, which is pretty decent. I live with my parents, so maybe family influences are a factor here.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), which might make me more responsive to ads that emphasize social benefits. However, I also tend to be careless (agree) and sometimes rude (disagree). I'm not very helpful or unselfish (strongly disagree) but thorough in my work (agree). I worry a lot (agree) but have an active imagination and am original with new ideas (strongly agree).

Now, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance.

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, since I'm outgoing and care about social image, the part about looking good might appeal to me. But as a blue-collar worker with high income, maybe I have other priorities. Also, the drink is something I might not prioritize unless it's marketed well. So maybe around 3/7.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea of being energized and looking good is appealing, but if the ad doesn't show real benefits or has a catchy message, it might not be that interesting to me. Maybe a 4?

3. Do I think the ad is good? It makes some positive claims, but without specific evidence, I'm skeptical. Maybe a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? If the visuals and messaging are appealing, maybe around a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The product seems useful, but without trying it, I'm not sure. Maybe 3/7.

2. Try to buy: Since I worry a lot and tend to be thorough, I might need more evidence before buying. So perhaps a 4?

3. Consider buying: It's something that could fit into my lifestyle, so maybe a higher score like 5.
