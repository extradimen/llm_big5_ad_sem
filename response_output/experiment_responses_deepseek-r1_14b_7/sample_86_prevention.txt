Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my attitude towards this advertisement and my purchase intention based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let's break it down.

First, let me understand my own profile better. I'm a male from China under 20, with a bachelorâ€™s degree, working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, earning between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm talkative (strongly agree), outgoing and sociable (neutral), reserved (strongly agree), helpful and unselfish (neutral), trusting (agree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough in my work (agree), not good at making plans (disagree), careless (neutral), get nervous easily (neutral), worry a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (agree), not very imaginative (disagree), original with ideas (agree), and have some artistic interests (disagree).

So, the ad is targeting people who might feel tired and look dull without this drink. Let's think about each part.

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad plays on fear of looking tired and dull. I'm someone who worries a lot and sometimes gets nervous, so maybe the idea of not wanting to appear tired resonates. However, being reserved and introverted might mean I don't care as much about social appearances. Plus, my monthly income is quite high for my age in Vietnam, so perhaps I'm more concerned about looking good in social settings.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message is clear but a bit generic. It uses negative emotions to push the product, which might appeal to someone who worries a lot, like me. But as an introvert, maybe I don't find it that engaging because I'm not as focused on social appearances.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - For an ad to be good, it needs to effectively communicate the benefit. This one does that by highlighting the negative consequences of not using the product. Since I worry a lot, this could be persuasive. However, being reserved might mean I'm more skeptical about such claims.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Attractiveness in ads often relates to how well it resonates with the target audience. As someone who's concerned about looking good but also reserved, maybe I don't find it overly attractive because the message is a bit pushy and relies on fear.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad makes me think about the benefits, but does it make me want to buy? Since my income is high, I might be more inclined to buy products that enhance my image, but as a blue-collar worker, maybe I'm looking for something practical and effective rather than just image.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Trying the product would depend on how convinced I am. The ad's message is clear, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make me take action without more information or evidence of effectiveness.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering it is a middle ground. The ad makes me aware of the problem it solves, so I might think about it when making a purchase decision, especially if it fits within my budget and lifestyle.

Putting it all together, I'm torn because while the ad targets some of my traits like worrying a lot and caring about appearances, being reserved and introverted might make me more critical and less likely to be immediately swayed. My intention to buy is moderate; I'm considering it but not sure yet.
