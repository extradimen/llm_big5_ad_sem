Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.**: Neutral (4). The ad's message about staying energized and looking good is positive, but as a single woman in her 50s, maybe it's more targeted towards younger demographics. Not sure if it resonates personally.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: Agree (5). It highlights benefits that are appealing, even though I'm not entirely convinced by the targeting.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: Neutral (4). The message is clear but lacks specific details or proof, making it hard to fully trust.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Disagree (3). It's somewhat generic and doesn't capture my personal interests or lifestyle.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Neutral (4). The benefits are tempting, but I'm not sure about the product's actual effectiveness.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Disagree (3). Without more information or a strong reason, I'm hesitant to try it.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: Neutral (4). It's on my radar, but I need more convincing before making a decision.
