Alright, let me go through this step by step. First, I need to understand the ad and my own demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable.

Looking at my background: I'm a 50-59-year-old single male from China with a postgraduate degree, working in 'Other,' making less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative, outgoing, not reserved, but I disagree with being helpful and unselfish. I’m neutral on trust, sometimes rude, thorough, don't follow through well, tend to be careless, not nervous, not much of a worrier, emotionally stable, not imaginative, and original but not too much.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** – The message is clear about energy and appearance, which are important. But the way it's phrased might be a bit direct. I'm 4/7 on this because it's good but maybe not enough to make me like it.

2. **Interesting.** – It's straightforward and relevant for someone my age concerned with energy levels. So, 5/7.

3. **Good ad.** – Effective in conveying the product's benefits. I think it does a decent job, so 6/7.

4. **Attractive.** – Not particularly catchy or visually appealing described textually. Maybe average at 5/7.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.** – The ad makes me consider, but not enough to intend buying immediately. 3/7.

2. **Try to buy.** – It's a consideration point; I might give it a try if available. 4/7.

3. **Consider buying.** – Definitely on my mind as something to think about. 5/7.

So overall, the ad is decent but not compelling enough for me to act immediately.
