Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The advertisement focuses on feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Given my personality traits, especially being talkative as Neutral and reserved as Neutral, the message might not strongly resonate since it doesn't highlight social aspects much. I'm not convinced it's directly targeting me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The ad is straightforward but lacks creativity or emotional appeal for me. My imagination is Disagree, so a simple message isn't engaging enough to find interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Since I don't find it interesting or emotionally stable in its presentation, my belief in the ad's effectiveness is low.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visual and emotional appeal are minimal for me, so attraction isn't there.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Given that I tend to be careless (Strongly Agree), I might not prioritize buying such a drink unless convinced otherwise. Plus, without a strong emotional hook, my intent is low.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** My tendency towards carelessness and the lack of personal relevance in the ad make me less likely to seek it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Even though I might not act on it immediately, considering it could happen if reminded or if the product is encountered elsewhere, but it's a weak consideration.
