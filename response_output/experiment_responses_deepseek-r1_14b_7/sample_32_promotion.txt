Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let's break it down based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, my background: I'm a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman with a bachelor’s degree working as a civil servant. My income is around 26-35 million VND monthly, so I have a decent income but not extremely high. I'm divorced, which might affect my lifestyle choices and priorities.

Looking at the ad's message: It focuses on energy and looking good daily. As a busy civil servant, staying energized could be appealing, especially since my job likely requires long hours or stressful situations. However, the part about "looking your best" is more of a bonus but might not be the main driver for me.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative? No, so maybe not someone who's looking to share this drink with others much. Being outgoing and sociable is neutral—so perhaps not very influenced by social aspects in ads. Reserved? Not really a fit either; I don't mind if it's not overly emphasized.

Helpful and unselfish? Strongly disagree, which might make me less likely to care about community or social benefits from the product. Trusting? Also strongly disagree, so credibility is important but maybe the ad needs more trustworthy elements. Sometimes rude: Agree, so I'm not one to be easily swayed by overly friendly ads.

Thorough job: Agree, so if the ad presents clear and thorough information, it could resonate. Making plans and following through: Neutral, which means I might not be swayed by that aspect. Careless? Agree, but this is more about my personal habits, maybe less relevant to the ad's appeal. Getting nervous easily: Agree, so stress-reducing aspects might matter.

Emotionally stable: Disagree; perhaps ads that evoke strong emotions might not work well. Active imagination and originality: I agree on being original, which could mean I appreciate creative ads, but having few artistic interests means the ad shouldn't rely too much on creativity to appeal to me.

So, for attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: The product's benefits are good, but maybe not enough to make me like the ad unless it resonates with my needs.
2. Interesting: If it clearly states how it helps with energy and looking good, it could be interesting.
3. Good: It depends on whether the claims are believable. I'm not trusting, so credibility matters.
4. Attractive: Visual appeal is important, but if it's too flashy, it might not attract me.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Maybe not immediately unless convinced of benefits.
2. Try to buy: If the ad provides enough convincing info and trust, I might consider trying.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, if after thinking about it, it seems useful.

I think each attitude score will be moderate, maybe 4 or 5, but purchase intention scores might be lower because of my cautious nature.
