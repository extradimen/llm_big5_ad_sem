Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, understanding the ad: It says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting people who want energy and looking good. 

Now, my background: I'm from China, over 60 years old, married, have a postgraduate degree, work as an office worker, and earn more than 46 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I tend to be outgoing but not talkative. I find it hard to be helpful, sometimes careless, get nervous easily, worry a bit, lack emotional stability, have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often, and have few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's attitude scores:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is about energy and looking good, which are appealing, especially for someone in their career. However, considering my age, maybe it's more targeted towards younger people. Plus, I'm not very into ads that promise too much. So I might not strongly like it but have some interest. Maybe a 4.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea of staying energized and looking good is positive. But since I'm over 60, maybe the target audience isn't me. Still, it's a good concept. I'd say around 5.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It has a clear message but might be too generic. I don't know if it's trustworthy enough to make a purchase decision. Maybe 4.

4. Is the ad attractive? The visuals and messaging could be appealing, but again, not tailored to me specifically. So perhaps a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy? Not really, because I'm over 60 and more health-conscious, maybe preferring traditional methods to stay energized rather than a drink. Plus, the ad doesn't provide enough evidence of effectiveness. Maybe a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? Slightly higher interest due to the benefits mentioned, but without trust in the product's claims, probably not. Maybe around 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's on my mind because it addresses energy and appearance, but I'm not convinced enough yet. So maybe a 5.

I need to make sure each score is between 1-7. Let me check again:

Ad attitude: 4, 5, 4, 5
Purchase intention: 3, 4, 5

Yes, that makes sense.
