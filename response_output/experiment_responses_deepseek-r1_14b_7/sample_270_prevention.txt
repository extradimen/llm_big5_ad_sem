Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: She's from China, over 60 years old, has a postgraduate degree but is a blue-collar worker with a low income. Lives with parents and has certain personality traits.

Personality-wise, she strongly agrees she's helpful and trusting but sometimes rude. She’s neutral on thoroughness, planning, being careless, and having an active imagination. She agrees she comes up with new ideas but doesn't have artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product.

She is talkative? Disagree. Outgoing? Neutral. Reserved? Disagree. So she might not be very outgoing but isn't reserved either. She’s helpful, which makes her approachable, but sometimes rude—maybe she’s more direct or less polite.

Emotionally stable and neutral on other traits. She doesn’t have an active imagination but does come up with new ideas, so maybe practical creativity.

Now, evaluating the ad: Does it appeal to her? The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. For someone over 60, staying energized and looking good might be important. But she's a blue-collar worker with low income—maybe cost is a concern.

She’s helpful but sometimes rude; perhaps she values practicality over social niceties. The ad suggests a consequence (feeling tired, looking dull), which could play on her desire to maintain energy and appearance.

Does she like the ad? Maybe not strongly because it's direct and maybe manipulative. She might find it interesting if it resonates with her needs but not necessarily good or attractive.

Purchase intention: She has low income, so expensive products might be out of reach. Even if she considers buying, the cost could be a barrier. So she might not intend to purchase immediately but could consider it if affordable.

Scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: Neutral? Maybe 4? Not strongly.
2. Interesting: It's a direct message, maybe 5?
3. Good: Doesn't feel manipulative or truthful? Maybe 3.
4. Attractive: The ad is clear but not visually appealing, so 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Low income, might not afford it—maybe 2.
2. Try: Might think about it but not sure—3.
3. Consider: It's a consideration—probably 5? Or maybe lower if cost is an issue.

Wait, considering her low income, she might not have the money for such products, so intent and trying are low, but considering could be neutral or slightly positive.

Maybe:

Ad attitude scores: [4,5,3,4]
Purchase intention: [2,3,4]

I think I'll settle on that.
