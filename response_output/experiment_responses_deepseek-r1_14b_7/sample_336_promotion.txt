Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this student from China would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, her demographic details: she's a female student under 20, living with parents, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's actually a pretty high income for a student in Vietnam, so maybe she has more disposable income than average. She's studying for a bachelor’s degree, which might mean she's interested in products that align with her lifestyle or social image.

Looking at her personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree. So she's not the type to talk a lot, but outgoing and sociable: Agree. Maybe she prefers more interactive environments but isn't necessarily the life of the party.
- Reserved: Neutral. So sometimes she's reserved, sometimes not.
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree. She values helping others, which might make her consider products that have social benefits or are seen as responsible choices.
- Trusting: Disagree. She doesn't trust easily, so credibility is important to her.
- Sometimes rude: Agree. This might indicate she's direct or has a bold personality, but it could also mean she values honesty in ads.
- Thorough job: Agree. She's detail-oriented, so the ad needs to be clear and provide enough information.
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree. So she's not very organized, which might affect her purchase decisions if the product isn't convenient or if the ad doesn't clearly convey benefits.
- Careless: Disagree. She's cautious but maybe not overly so.
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Disagree. She's calm under pressure.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree. She's anxious, so ads that make her feel stressed about not having the product might affect her.
- Emotionally stable: Agree. So she can handle emotional situations but maybe seeks stability in products.
- Active imagination: Disagree. She doesn't have a vivid imagination, so the ad needs to be straightforward.
- Original and comes up with new ideas: Agree. She's creative, so innovative aspects might appeal to her.
- Few artistic interests: Neutral. So she might not be highly engaged by overly artsy ads but isn't opposed to them either.

The advertisement is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

So the key selling points are energy and appearance. For a student, staying energized could relate to academic performance or social life. Looking good might tie into self-esteem or fitting in socially.

Considering her traits:

- She's outgoing but not talkative, so maybe she values products that enhance her social image without being overly attention-seeking.
- Her agreeance with helpfulness and originality might make her responsive to ads that position the drink as a way to improve both energy levels and appearance innovatively.
- However, her disagreement with trusting others could mean she's skeptical of the ad's claims. The ad needs to be credible.
- Her thoroughness suggests she would appreciate clear, detailed information about how the drink works or its benefits.
- She worries a lot but is emotionally stable, so the ad shouldn't create anxiety but should offer reassurance.
- Since she has an active imagination and is original, an ad that's creative without being over-the-top might appeal to her.

Now, evaluating each aspect:

Ad Attitude:
1. I like the ad: The message is positive but since she's not very trusting, maybe it doesn't strongly resonate. 4/7.
2. Interesting: The idea of combining energy and appearance could be interesting. 5/7.
3. Good: It’s a balanced message, but without trust, maybe not top tier. 6/7? Wait, no—since she worries a lot, perhaps it's seen as too good to be true, so maybe lower. Maybe 4/7?
Wait, let me think again. The drink is presented as helping two key areas: energy and appearance. She values being helpful and original. But her lack of trust makes her skeptical. So the ad might not be seen as entirely believable, affecting how good she thinks it is. Maybe 'good' gets a 4.

4. Attractive: If the visuals are appealing, but she's reserved and not highly talkative, maybe she finds it moderately attractive. 5/7?

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Since she's detail-oriented and might need something that provides clear benefits without being too pushy. But if she's skeptical, maybe low intention. 3/7.
2. Try to buy: She might be cautious but open to trying, so 4/7.
3. Consider buying: Considering it as an option, so 5/7.

Wait, but her monthly income is high, so she has the means. The ad targets two main needs for a student: energy and looking good, which are relevant. But since she's not trusting of ads, maybe she wouldn't intend to buy right away, but would consider it after more thought.

Alternatively, perhaps she values being thorough and helpful, so considering buying makes sense as 5/7, trying is lower because she needs more info, and intending to purchase is even lower. Or the other way around.

Hmm, I think I need to adjust based on her traits:

- Ad Attitude Scores:
1. Like: Maybe 4 (since it's positive but not necessarily something she'd strongly like unless it resonates with her values)
2. Interesting: 5 (because combining energy and appearance is a good hook)
3. Good: 4 (skeptical of the claims due to low trust)
4. Attractive: 5 (if visually appealing, but if not, maybe lower)

- Purchase Intention Scores:
1. Intend: 3 (she's cautious and not very trusting, so initial intent is low)
2. Try: 4 (maybe after seeing others use it or more info)
3. Consider: 5 (it's on her radar as a possible option)

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact numbers here. Maybe Ad Attitude scores could be higher if the ad aligns well with her desire for originality and helping herself look good, but her skepticism might temper that.

Alternatively:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like: 5 (positive message)
2. Interesting: 6
3. Good: 4 (due to trust issues)
4. Attractive: 5

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 4
3. Consider: 5

I think that makes sense because the ad is interesting and she might like it, but due to her cautious nature, her intent to buy isn't high yet.
