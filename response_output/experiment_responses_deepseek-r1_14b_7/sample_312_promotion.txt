Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. Given my personality traits, I'm outgoing but sometimes careless and get nervous easily. The ad's message is positive but lacks specifics about how it works or benefits, which makes me less likely to trust it.

For purchase intention: While I like the idea of staying energized, my tendency towards being unhelpful (from the Disagree in helpfulness) and originality might not connect with a generic product claim. Also, worrying a lot makes me cautious about health products without clear evidence.
