Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their background and personality. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the demographic profile. The person is from China, male, under 20, has a high school education, works as a managerial employee (which is interesting for someone so young), is divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. That's about $640 USD, which is quite low for a managerial role, especially in urban areas where salaries tend to be higher.

Now, looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree (so he likes talking)
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree (very social)
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree (not reserved at all)
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Agree
- Sometimes rude: Agree (he might have a tendency to be impolite)
- Thorough job: Agree (detailed and careful in work)
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree (doesn't follow through on plans)
- Careless: Disagree (not very careless)
- Gets nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree (so he's not emotionally stable)
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original and comes up with new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Few artistic interests: Disagree

The advertisement is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So, the key selling points are energy and appearance.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - Given his outgoing nature and love for social interactions, an ad that emphasizes looking good and having energy would appeal to him. He might find it relatable if it's about staying presentable in social settings or work, despite being a managerial employee which is surprising at such a young age.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - His imagination is not very active (Disagree), but he's original and comes up with new ideas (Strongly Agree). So an ad that offers something new or presents information in a novel way might catch his interest, especially if it ties into staying energized and looking good.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - He generally trusts (Agree) and isn't careless (Disagree), so if the ad seems trustworthy and not too over-the-top, he might find it believable. However, his tendency to be rude and sometimes impolite could make him skeptical of overly positive ads.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being outgoing and sociable, he likely values looking good in social situations. The ad's focus on appearance and energy would align with that, making it attractive to him.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He doesn't follow through on plans (Strongly Disagree) but does a thorough job (Agree). His income is low, so price might be a concern. However, the ad's appeal to social presentation and energy could make him consider it despite financial constraints.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - If he likes the idea of looking good and being energetic, he might want to try it, especially if it's marketed in a way that resonates with his social nature.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Even if not intending to purchase immediately, the ad's message could make him think about it as an option when shopping for drinks or supplements.

Putting it all together:

- Ad attitude: He would likely like, find interesting and good because it aligns with his social values, even though he might be a bit critical. The trust factor helps here.
- Purchase intention: While he considers the product due to the ad's appeal, his low income and tendency not to follow through on plans might make him less likely to intend to buy immediately but more open to considering it.

So, scores might reflect moderate agreement on liking and being interesting, strong belief in its goodness, and attractiveness. For purchase intent, he is somewhat inclined to consider buying but isn't fully committed.
