Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores: 
1. **I like the ad.** (Score: 4) – The ad mentions staying energized and looking good, which are positive benefits. Since I'm a student, maybe it's targeting busy individuals who need energy. However, being reserved, I might not feel an immediate connection or excitement about the ad. So, my preference is neutral but leans slightly towards agreement.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** (Score: 3) – The message is clear and relatable for someone looking to maintain energy levels. But since I'm more reserved and don't feel a strong emotional pull, it's just somewhat interesting rather than very engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** (Score: 4) – The content is straightforward with benefits that make sense. It doesn't seem misleading or overly persuasive, so my belief in its effectiveness is moderate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** (Score: 5) – While the message is positive and could appeal to many, being reserved might mean I'm not overwhelmed by it. However, the benefits are appealing enough that I rate it as more attractive than neutral.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** (Score: 4) – The ad highlights useful benefits, but without specific information about the product's quality or any personal connection, my intent isn't very high. It's more of a consideration phase.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** (Score: 3) – There's some interest, but I'm not actively seeking it out unless prompted elsewhere. This is a cautious approach based on the ad alone.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** (Score: 5) – The benefits align with my needs as a student balancing studies and daily life, so it's definitely something to think about when considering health products.

Overall, while the ad isn't overly persuasive to me personally, it does touch on points that could be beneficial, leading me to consider the product but not feel an urgent need to purchase it immediately.
