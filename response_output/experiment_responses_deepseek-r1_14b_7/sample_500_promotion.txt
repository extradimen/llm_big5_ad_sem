Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude: The main points in the ad are about staying energized and looking your best every day. Given my personality traits, being talkative and outgoing aligns with needing energy to socialize, so that's a positive point. However, the part about looking good might not resonate as much because I'm more focused on functionality than appearance.

Looking at "I like the ad." (1): On a scale of 1-7, I'm neutral but slightly leaning towards disagreement. The idea of energy is good for someone active, but the vanity aspect doesn't hit me as much. So maybe a 3.

Next, "I think the ad is interesting." (2): It's somewhat interesting because staying energized is relevant, but the message feels generic. Maybe around a 4-5? Let's say 5.

"I believe the ad is good." (3): The core benefits are solid, but the execution might be too vague. Not bad, but not great. Maybe a 6.

Lastly, "I find the ad attractive." (4): Visually and conceptually, it's decent. If I were to imagine the ad, it's likely colorful and energetic, which could be appealing. So perhaps a 5.

For purchase intention: The drink is positioned for daily use, which fits with someone who's active. However, I tend to worry about being careless and sometimes rude, but that doesn't directly affect purchasing intent. 

"I intend to purchase this product." (1): Maybe not immediately, so a lower score like 3.

"I will try to buy this product." (2): Without strong motivation, maybe 4.

Considering buying it: It's something I might think about if others recommend it, so "I will consider buying this product." (3) could be around 5-6, but let me go with a 5 since it's not an immediate must-have.
