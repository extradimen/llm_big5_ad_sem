Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would score their attitude towards the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down.

First, looking at the demographic profile: He's from China, over 60, married, earns a decent income as an office worker with a high school education. His personality traits show he's talkative neutral, outgoing disagree, reserved neutral, helpful neutral, trusting disagree, sometimes rude neutral, thorough agree, makes plans and follows through agree, careless agree, gets nervous neutral, worries strongly disagree, emotionally stable strongly agree, has an active imagination strongly agree, original disagrees, artistic interests neutral.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

So the key here is that the drink is presented as something that prevents feeling tired and looking dull. Given his age and occupation, maybe he's someone who values staying energetic or presentable, especially in an office setting.

His personality traits: He's thorough, makes plans, follows through—so he might be methodical about health products. He's emotionally stable and has a strong imagination but isn't particularly original or outgoing. 

For the ad attitude:
1. I like the ad.
   - The message is straightforward, but it's trying to appeal to looking good and feeling energetic. Since he values being thorough and making plans, maybe he finds this message useful but not necessarily likable in a creative way.

2. Interesting.
   - He has an active imagination, so the idea that without the drink you might look dull could be intriguing. But since he's neutral on originality, it might not stand out as extremely interesting.

3. Good.
   - The ad is making a clear claim about health and appearance. Given his thorough nature, if the claims are backed up, he might see it as good. But without more info, maybe it's just average.

4. Attractive.
   - The message targets something that affects everyone—looking dull and feeling tired. It's a broad appeal, which might be attractive but not necessarily compelling enough for him to strongly agree.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase.
   - He's methodical but the ad doesn't provide evidence or details. Without more info, he might not feel compelled to intend buying it immediately.

2. Try to buy.
   - The message is about prevention, which aligns with being thorough and cautious. However, without a strong emotional appeal or trust factor, he might be hesitant to try it unless recommended elsewhere.

3. Consider buying.
   - Since the ad addresses real concerns (feeling tired, looking dull), he might consider it but not rush into a purchase based solely on this ad.

I think his scores would reflect that the ad is somewhat relevant but doesn't strongly resonate enough for high purchase intentions. He's more likely to consider it after more information or personal experience.
