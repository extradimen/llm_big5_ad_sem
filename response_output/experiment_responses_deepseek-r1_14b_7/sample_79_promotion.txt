Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: The advertisement is quite generic and doesn't really connect with my personality traits. Being reserved and not too talkative, it's hard for me to relate to the energy aspect. Plus, the part about looking your best might not resonate as much since I'm more focused on functionality than appearance. So, a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: While the message isn't particularly engaging or new, there's some appeal in the idea of staying energized. However, it still feels too vague and doesn't address any specific needs I might have. A 4 seems fair.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: The ad doesn't provide enough concrete information about how the drink actually works or its benefits. Without trust in the product's efficacy, my belief in the ad itself is low. So, a 2.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visuals and messaging might attract some, but they don't speak to me personally. Since I'm not very trusting and prefer more substance over style, it doesn't catch my eye much. A 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Without strong reasons or evidence of the drink's effectiveness, there's no compelling reason for me to plan a purchase. So, a 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Even though I'm somewhat open to new products, the ad hasn't convinced me enough to seek it out. A 3 feels right.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: There's a slight consideration because of the drink's potential benefits, but without more information or trust in the brand, it's not a definite yes. A 4 is appropriate.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly influence me either way, so my scores reflect that moderate interest and cautious consideration.
