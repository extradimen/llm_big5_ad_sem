Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. First, I need to understand their background and personality.

They're from China, a managerial employee with a decent income but single. Their education is high school, so they might be more focused on practical aspects. Now, looking at their personality traits:

- They disagree with being talkative and outgoing, which makes them seem reserved.
- Strongly disagree with being helpful and trusting, and agree with sometimes being rude. So, maybe they're more self-centered or not very friendly.
- They don't do thorough jobs, aren't good at following plans, and tend to be careless? Wait, that's conflicting because if they're a manager, I'd expect them to be organized. Hmm, perhaps they have some traits that make them less reliable in certain areas.
- They get nervous easily but disagree on worrying a lot, but actually, they strongly agree on worrying a lot. So maybe they are anxious.
- Emotionally stable? They agreed on that, so maybe they manage their anxiety well.
- Don't have an active imagination and are neutral on originality, but they do have few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. 

Considering this person is single and a manager with decent income, maybe she values looking good and having energy for work or social life. However, her personality traits suggest she might not be too concerned about social interactions since she's reserved and sometimes rude.

But the ad is positive, promoting energy and looking best. She might find it appealing if she wants to stay productive at work and look good, but given her other traits like being unhelpful and trusting, maybe she doesn't see the value in such products or finds ads manipulative.

She also worries a lot, so perhaps she's skeptical about claims that are too good. Maybe she doesn't trust the ad's promises, scoring it lower on believing it. 

For purchase intention: She might not be convinced to buy immediately but could consider it if she feels the benefits align with her needs despite her skepticism.

So, putting this together, her scores would likely be low for liking and finding the ad good because of her reserved nature and distrust towards such claims. However, considering the practical aspects (energy, appearance), she might not completely dismiss buying it but isn't strongly inclined either.
