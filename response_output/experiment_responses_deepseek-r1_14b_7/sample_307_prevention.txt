Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. So, first, I need to understand her background and personality traits.

She's from China, female, in her late twenties, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. She lives with her parents and earns over 46 million VND monthly, which is quite high for Vietnam, considering the average income there. Her personality traits show that she's neutral about being talkative and outgoing, but strongly disagrees with being reserved or helpful. She tends to be rude, thorough, not very trusting, and isn't into creative stuff.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, the ad is targeting people who might want to stay energetic and presentable.

Let's break down her attitude towards the ad:

1. **Like the ad**: The ad seems to focus on energy and appearance. Since she's outgoing but not necessarily into being helpful or trusting, maybe the message resonates a bit because it's about looking good and feeling good. But since she tends to be rude, perhaps she doesn't connect with ads that are too positive or overly cheerful.

2. **Interesting**: The ad is straightforward but might not capture her interest much. She's more into being thorough and original, so maybe the ad isn't creative enough for her. So, interesting score would be low.

3. **Good**: For an ad to be good, it needs to make a strong argument or have some depth. This ad is simple, just stating a consequence without any emotional appeal. She might not find it compelling, so her score here would be neutral to slightly disagree.

4. **Attractive**: The ad's message is about avoiding tiredness and dull looks, which could be appealing if she values looking good. But given her personality, she might not find the ad particularly attractive because it's too generic.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: She makes thorough plans but disagrees with following through. Maybe she's analytical but doesn't act on it. The product seems functional, but without a strong emotional hook, she might not feel compelled to buy it.

2. **Try to buy**: Even if she considers the ad, her tendency to be careless and not very trusting might make her skeptical of the product's effectiveness. So, trying it out isn't a strong possibility.

3. **Consider buying**: Given that she earns a high income, maybe she can afford such products. However, since she doesn't feel strongly about the ad, her consideration is neutral at best.

Putting it all together, her scores are likely to be on the lower side for both attitude and purchase intention.
