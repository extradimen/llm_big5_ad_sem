Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad's message about energy and looking best is positive but seems too generic. It doesn't speak to my specific needs as a postgraduate civil servant in China. Plus, the language feels a bit clich√©. So, I'm not particularly drawn to it. A 2 here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for busy professionals. However, without specific benefits or relatable scenarios, it's not very engaging. Neutral feelings here, a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - It's well-intentioned but lacks depth. There's no evidence or specifics about how the drink actually works. Without trust in the product, belief in the ad is limited. A 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visuals might be nice, but without seeing them, it's hard to gauge. The message isn't unique enough to stand out. So, a middle score of 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - I'm skeptical about the claims and lack of evidence. Plus, my budget is tight as a civil servant. No strong intent here, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Maybe if it's recommended by others or there are discounts, but not likely on my own. A 3 reflects mild consideration.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's in the back of my mind, but other factors like cost and evidence weigh more. Still a low 4 as I'm somewhat open to it if circumstances change.
