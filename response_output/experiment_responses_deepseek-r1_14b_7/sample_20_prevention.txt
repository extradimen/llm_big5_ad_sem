Alright, I'm a student from China, female, under 20, earning between 16-25 million VND monthly. I'm talkative and outgoing but not reserved. I help others and don't mind being unselfish, though I sometimes worry about whether people are trustworthy. I do thorough work but am careless at times. My emotions are stable, and I don't get nervous easily. I don't have an active imagination or original ideas, but I'm interested in art.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message is about preventing tiredness and looking good. Since I’m a student, staying alert and presentable might be important, especially for socializing and school activities. The ad's fear appeal makes me think of negative consequences without the product, which could be persuasive because I value looking good and being energetic.

However, the ad doesn't offer specific benefits or evidence about the drink. It’s a bit vague, so it lacks credibility for me. I'm not sure how the drink actually helps; maybe it's just marketing hype. The emotional appeal might work since I’m outgoing and care about my appearance, but without concrete info, it's hard to trust.

On attitude towards the ad: I like it because it addresses looking good and feeling energetic, which are important to me. It’s interesting as it uses a relatable scenario. However, I'm not sure if it's good because it lacks specifics. The attractiveness is moderate since it's clear but could be better with more details.

For purchase intention: I don't intend to buy immediately without more info. Trying it might happen if friends recommend it, and considering it depends on knowing its benefits.
