Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It seems to target people who want energy and appearance benefits daily. 

Now, looking at my demographics: I'm from China, male, over 60, have a bachelor’s degree, work in an office, am divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I’m reserved, sometimes rude, thorough, make plans but can be careless, neutral about trust and nervousness, not emotionally stable, have an active imagination but don't consider myself original or artistic.

Starting with the ad's attitude scores:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is positive, focusing on energy and appearance, which are important for daily life. However, considering my reserved nature and sometimes being rude, maybe the ad feels a bit too upbeat. But it’s not negative, so maybe a 4.

2. Is it interesting? The benefits are clear, but I might find it somewhat generic. Not very compelling to me, so perhaps a 3.

3. Is it good? It's straightforward and positive, but given my tendency towards being reserved and possibly less interested in such ads, I'd rate it a 4.

4. Is it attractive? The message is appealing, but the style might not resonate with me as someone who isn't outgoing or sociable. Maybe a 3.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy it? My monthly income is low, and I'm over 60, so health products are more of a consideration, but I'm cautious. The ad's claims seem good, but without strong personal interest, maybe a 4.

2. Will I try to buy it? Since the product seems beneficial, I might make an effort, but my tendency towards being unhelpful and sometimes rude (from personality) makes me less likely to seek it out actively. Maybe a 3.

3. Would I consider buying it? Given the benefits and that it's something I could use, I might think about it, so perhaps a 4.

I need to ensure each score is between 1-7, with 1 as strongly disagree and 7 as strongly agree.
