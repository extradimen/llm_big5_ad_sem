Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 20-29-year-old Chinese male student living with my parents and earning around 26-35 million VND a month. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), reserved (Strongly Agree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), worry a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree). 

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, the message is about avoiding tiredness and looking good. 

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: The tagline seems to connect with feeling tired. As a student, I often feel tired, so maybe it's relevant. But I'm reserved, so ads that are too direct might not appeal to me much. Maybe 3.

2. Interesting: It's a common concern, but nothing unique about the message. Not super interesting, perhaps a 4.

3. Good: The ad is straightforward and addresses a real issue. However, it doesn't inspire or feel original, so maybe a 5.

4. Attractive: The wording is clear but not visually engaging. I don't imagine it's very attractive, so a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The message is about preventing tiredness and looking good. As someone who cares about image, this might make me consider it. Maybe a 4.

2. Try to buy: Since the ad targets feeling tired and looking dull, which are relatable, I might be inclined to try it. Perhaps a 5.

3. Consider buying: It's not a strong enough reason for immediate purchase but makes me think about it. A 6 seems reasonable.
