Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude scores: 

1. **I like the ad**: The ad's message about staying energized and looking your best is positive, but given my personality traits, especially being talkative and having an active imagination, I might find it a bit generic. So, I'm not strongly drawn to it, hence a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: While the benefits are clear, there's nothing particularly innovative or engaging in the message. My score here is also a middle-of-the-road 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The ad isn't necessarily bad, but it lacks depth and specific details that would make me trust its claims more. A 5 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visuals or creatives aren't described here, so based on the text alone, it's not particularly compelling to me. Thatâ€™s why I scored it a 4.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My tendency towards being careless and sometimes rude might make me less likely to prioritize this product unless there's a strong reason. Plus, I'm more of an ideas person than someone focused on daily products. So, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's no immediate motivation for me to seek it out; it doesn't align with my current needs or preferences. Hence, another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: While I don't have any strong reasons against it, there are also no compelling reasons to make me think about purchasing it. A 4 feels right here.
