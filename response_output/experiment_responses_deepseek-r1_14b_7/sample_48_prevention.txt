Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down her profile and personality traits first.

She's a Chinese woman under 20 with a bachelor’s degree working as a civil servant, which might mean she's quite busy or has certain social expectations. She's divorced, so maybe she values independence or self-care more. Her income is over 46 million VND, which is pretty high, so she can afford luxury items.

Looking at her personality traits: she's talkative and outgoing but also reserved. That might make her selective about when she's social and when she's private. She doesn't see herself as helpful or unselfish, which could mean she values her own comfort more. She's trusting, which is a positive trait, but sometimes rude, so maybe she has a strong personality.

She tends to be careless? No, actually she strongly disagrees with being careless and worries a lot. That suggests she might be detail-oriented and anxious about things. She's not emotionally stable and doesn't have an active imagination or come up with new ideas, which might make her more practical.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. Given her age and occupation, she might be concerned about looking good and being efficient in her work or social life.

I think the ad would appeal to her desire to avoid feeling tired and looking bad. Since she worries a lot, maybe she's concerned about others' perceptions of her. But she's also reserved and sometimes rude, so maybe the idea of staying energized is important for her image.

However, she doesn't like being unhelpful or doesn't see herself as helpful, which might not directly relate to the ad but shows she values herself over others. She gets nervous easily, which ties into looking dull if she's tired.

She has an active imagination and originality? Wait, no—she agreed with having an active imagination but strongly disagreed with being original. So maybe she likes creative things but isn't someone who comes up with new ideas. The ad is simple and direct, so that might not engage her much.

Putting it together: She might find the ad somewhat interesting because it addresses looking tired and dull, which could affect her image. But she's not sure about trusting the product completely, maybe due to being more on the reserved side. Her worry makes her consider potential benefits but also be cautious.

For purchase intention, since she can afford it, but she's not convinced entirely, maybe she's neutral or leans towards considering it if others recommend it.
