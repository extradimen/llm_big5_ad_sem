Alright, I need to evaluate how a specific person would respond to an advertisement based on their demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience is someone from China, male, over 60 years old, with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, earning between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. He finds it hard to be helpful and unselfish, is trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in his work, makes plans and follows through, isn't careless, gets nervous easily, is neutral about worrying a lot, emotionally stable, not very imaginative, but original with ideas, and has few artistic interests.

So, considering his traits:

1. He's talkative, which might make social interactions important to him, but since he's not outgoing or reserved, maybe he doesn't seek out many social activities.
2. Being helpful is a Disagree trait—so he might not see the value in products that emphasize community or helping others.
3. Trusting (Agree) could mean he's more likely to believe what the ad says if it comes from a credible source.
4. Sometimes rude (Strongly Agree)—this might affect how he perceives ads that are pushy or overly persuasive, perhaps making him more critical or less trusting of such messages.
5. Thorough and planful (Strongly Agree) suggests he values reliability and consistency in products, possibly looking for brands he can trust long-term.
6. Emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)—so emotional appeals might not be as effective on him; he's more level-headed.
7. Original with ideas but not very imaginative—maybe the ad needs to present information clearly rather than relying on creativity.

Now, evaluating the ad itself: It's a prevention message, highlighting negative consequences without the product. Given his thorough and planful nature, he might appreciate ads that address potential problems directly. However, being emotionally stable, he may not be swayed by emotional appeals but could respond to logical arguments about preventing tiredness and dull looks.

Looking at purchase intention: He earns a decent income, so price might not be the main barrier. His tendency to make plans suggests he values consistency, so if this drink helps him maintain energy levels, it could fit into his routine. However, since he's not very trusting of others' help (Disagree on helpfulness), he might need more evidence or credible information about the product's benefits.

Regarding ad attitude:

1. He might not "like" the ad if it's too pushy or uses emotional tactics (since he's emotionally stable). So a lower score here.
2. Interesting: If the message is clear and addresses his potential needs, it could be interesting—maybe a 4 or 5.
3. Good: A prevention message that provides useful info might be seen as good, so around a 4-5.
4. Attractive: He's not very outgoing, so an ad with strong visuals but without over-the-top emotions might score medium-high.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase—might be low because he's not convinced yet, maybe a 3 or 4.
2. Try to buy—it could be slightly higher if the message resonates with his need for energy and appearance.
3. Consider buying—if the ad makes him think about it, he might consider, so around a 5.

Putting it all together: His scores are likely medium to low for ad attitude and somewhat cautious but not entirely dismissive towards purchase intentions.
