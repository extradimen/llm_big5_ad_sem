Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience is a 40-49-year-old single female from China with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing but Neutral on reservedness, strongly helpful and unselfish, sometimes careless, etc.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **Like the ad**: The message seems to target feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Given her age and occupation, she might be dealing with fatigue from work. But the ad is quite direct and possibly manipulative, so I'm not sure if she'd like it. Maybe a 3? Neutral but slightly negative.

2. **Interesting**: The concept ties tiredness to appearance, which could resonate with someone who cares about looking good. However, the phrasing might feel too pushy or fear-based. So maybe a 4?

3. **Good ad**: Being a good ad depends on whether it's seen as helpful or manipulative. Since she values being unselfish and is talkative but neutral on outgoingness, perhaps she finds it somewhat useful but not outstanding. Maybe a 5.

4. **Attractive**: The ad might not be visually appealing if the focus is too much on negatives. Attractiveness depends on imagery, which isn't provided here. Without knowing visuals, maybe she's Neutral with a slight negative leaning, so perhaps a 4.

For purchase intentions:

1. **Intend to purchase**: She might feel it addresses her tiredness but given her income and occupation, she might prioritize essential needs over such drinks. So maybe Disagree (2).

2. **Try to buy**: She's somewhat talkative and outgoing, so curiosity might lead her to try once. But again, budget constraints could be a factor. Maybe Neutral or 3.

3. **Consider buying**: She might think about it but not immediately decide. Considering is Neutral leaning towards maybe 4, but perhaps she's more hesitant.

Putting it all together, I'd estimate the ad attitude scores as [3, 4, 5, 4] and purchase intentions as [2, 3, 4].
