Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the advertisement states, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." As a civil servant in my 40s, I value staying alert and presentable, especially in professional settings. The ad directly targets feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which could impact my work performance and social image. 

However, when evaluating the ad's appeal, I considered several factors. My personality traits indicate that I'm somewhat reserved (Disagree) and generally not trusting (Strongly Disagree). These traits might make me skeptical of such advertisements. The message feels a bit manipulative because it plays on fears of appearing tired or dull, which are common concerns but could be exaggerated in ads.

I also tend to agree with being sometimes rude to others and careless, which might affect how I perceive the ad's messaging about social image. Additionally, I'm not particularly talkative or outgoing, so perhaps the ad's focus on looking good and feeling energized isn't as compelling to me as it might be to someone more extroverted.

Looking at purchase intention: While the product seems useful for staying alert, my tendency towards being unhelpful (Strongly Disagree) and less trusting makes me question if this drink is really necessary or just a marketing ploy. Plus, with a monthly income of 26-35 million VND, I'm not necessarily looking to spend on such products unless there's a strong reason.

In summary, the ad resonates somewhat because it addresses real concerns but feels manipulative and lacks trustworthiness due to my personality traits. My purchase intention is low because I don't feel an urgent need for this product and am skeptical of its claims.
