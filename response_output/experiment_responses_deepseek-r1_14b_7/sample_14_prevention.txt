Okay, let's break down how I approached evaluating this advertisement. First, I considered the demographic profile: a single, educated woman in her 30s from China with a moderate income. She's talkative but not very outgoing, somewhat reserved, and generally trusting but tends to be careless.

The ad targets tiredness and dull appearance, which could appeal to someone looking for an energy boost or wanting to look better. Given her personality traits, she might relate to feeling tired, especially if she's active or has a busy social life despite being reserved.

Looking at the attitude toward the ad: She agreed with being trusting but is neutral about helpfulness and originality. The message is clear but may not strongly resonate as interesting or good because it doesn't play into her strengths in original ideas. However, it could be seen as attractive if she values looking good.

For purchase intention, while she might intend to buy for the benefits, her tendency towards carelessness might make her less likely to follow through. She's agreeable with making plans but also tends to be careless, so consideration is there, but actual purchase intent is lower.
