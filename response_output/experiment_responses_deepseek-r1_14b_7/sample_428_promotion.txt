Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, married, and currently a student. My monthly income is under 15 million VND.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points are energy and appearance.

I'm helpful and unselfish, which makes me consider others' well-being. But I worry a lot and tend to be thorough. So ads need to have clear benefits and credible information.

The ad seems too vague. It doesn't provide specific details about the drink's ingredients or effects. As someone who does a thorough job, I'd want more evidence before trusting it.

I'm outgoing but reserved in my interactions. The ad might appeal to my desire for social approval and looking good, which aligns with being helpful towards others' perceptions.

However, the claim of "look your best every day" feels unrealistic. It sounds like a gimmick rather than a genuine benefit. I would need more concrete information before believing it.

I tend to plan things, so maybe planning to try the product if others vouch for it. But without trust or specific benefits, my intention is low.

On attitude towards the ad: It's okay but not engaging enough. The message isn't strong enough to make me like it or find it interesting. I don't believe in its effectiveness, and it doesn't attract me much.

For purchase intentions: Without trust or specifics, I'm hesitant. I might consider buying if others recommend it, but the ad alone doesn't push me to try it.
