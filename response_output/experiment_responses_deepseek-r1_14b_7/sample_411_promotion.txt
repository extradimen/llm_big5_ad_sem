Okay, I need to figure out how this person would score the ad based on their background and personality. Let me start by understanding his profile.

He's a Chinese male in his 50s, so maybe he's a bit more traditional or set in his ways. He has a high school education and works in an office, which might mean he values structure and efficiency. His monthly income is between 26 to 35 million VND, which isn't too low, but considering Vietnam's cost of living, it's moderate.

Looking at his personality traits: He doesn't like to talk much (disagrees being talkative) but is outgoing and sociable. However, he strongly agrees with being reserved, so maybe he's not the type to engage a lot socially. He's helpful and unselfish, but only neutral about it. Trusting, which could be good for ads, doesn't get nervous easily, worries a bit, but is emotionally stable. He's not creative or imaginative, original, and prefers few artistic interests.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. So, the key points are energy and appearance. Given his age, maybe he values staying active and looking good as he gets older. But since he's reserved and possibly more practical, he might not be swayed by overly energetic ads.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad: He's reserved and might not find it very likable unless it's straightforward. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: Since he doesn't have an active imagination or like new ideas, maybe neutral on interestingness. 4?
3. Good: If the message is clear about benefits but lacks depth, perhaps a 4.
4. Attractive: Not very appealing because it's not aligning with his reserved nature. Maybe a 5?

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He makes plans and follows through, so if convinced, he might intend. But since the ad feels generic, maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: If he thinks about it, but not sure yet. Maybe 3.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, as he worries a bit (maybe about health) but is practical. So a 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me adjust based on his traits.

He's talkative? Disagree. Reserved? Strongly Agree. So he might not find the ad too exciting or likable. Scores for ad attitude: 2,3,3,4?

Purchase intention: He makes thorough plans, so if convinced, he'll intend (5). Try to buy could be a 6 if interested. Consider buying as 5.

Alternatively, maybe I should score higher because the benefits are clear, but his reserved nature and practicality might make him more cautious. So ad attitude scores around 3-4 each, purchase intentions in mid-range.
