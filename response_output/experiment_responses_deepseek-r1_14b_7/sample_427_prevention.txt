Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're a Chinese woman in her 40s, with a bachelor's degree, working in an office, divorced, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so she might be looking for quality products that fit her lifestyle.

Looking at her personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, Sociable: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree
- Helpful and Unselfish: Disagree
- Generally Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes Rude: Neutral
- Thorough Job: Agree
- Makes Plans/Follows Through: Agree
- Careless: Agree
- Gets Nervous Easily: Agree
- Worries a Lot: Agree
- Emotionally Stable: Agree
- Active Imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original/New Ideas: Neutral
- Few Artistic Interests: Neutral

Hmm, she's talkative but not outgoing or sociable. That might mean she prefers conversations with close friends rather than socializing widely. She’s reserved and not very helpful or trusting, which could make her more cautious about ads.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target people who want to stay energetic and presentable. Given her age, she might be concerned about staying youthful and energetic.

She values doing a thorough job and making plans, so the product's effectiveness is important to her. However, she tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, which might make her skeptical of such ads. She worries a lot but is emotionally stable, so she might weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding.

Since she earns a good income, she’s probably open to purchasing premium products if they meet her needs. The ad's message about avoiding tiredness and looking dull could resonate with someone who values their appearance and energy levels.

But considering her personality—reserved, not trusting—the ad might come off as too pushy or manipulative. She's also emotionally stable but gets nervous, so the ad needs to be credible without being overbearing.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: she might find it interesting because it addresses concerns about energy and appearance, which are relevant. However, since she doesn't trust ads strongly and is reserved, she might not like it or find it good. But she could still consider buying if the product seems effective.

For purchase intention: she's thorough, so she'd want to know more before deciding. She might intend to purchase if convinced, but trying it would depend on her confidence in the product. Considering it is likely, as she plans and follows through.
