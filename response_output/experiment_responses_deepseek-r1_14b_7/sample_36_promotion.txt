Okay, so I need to figure out how this virtual person would score their attitude towards the ad and their purchase intention. Let's start by understanding the demographic and personality traits.

The person is from China, female, aged 40-49, educated in high school, a civil servant living with parents, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty decent income, so she's probably middle-class or higher.

Personality-wise, she's talkative (Agree), outgoing but Disagree on being sociable, Disagree on being reserved. She's helpful and unselfish (Agree), Neutral on trusting, Strongly Agrees she's sometimes rude, Neutral about thoroughness, Strongly Disagrees with making plans and following through, Disagrees on being careless, Disagrees on getting nervous or worrying a lot, Disagree on emotional stability. She lacks an active imagination, Disagree on originality, and Neutral on artistic interests.

So she's talkative but not necessarily outgoing in the sense of socializing a lot. She's helpful, maybe community-oriented. She tends to be rude sometimes, which might make her less approachable or perhaps more direct. Not very thorough, doesn't plan well, which could affect her decision-making process. She's not emotionally stable and isn't imaginative or original.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, considering her age group, 40-49, she might be looking for things that help with energy levels and maybe looking good, which could relate to anti-aging or maintaining a youthful appearance. Her income is decent, so she can afford such products.

She's helpful and unselfish, so perhaps she'd care about the benefits of the product for others as well. But being sometimes rude might make her less likely to be swayed by overly positive ads. She doesn't find ads very interesting or good—maybe because they don't align with her personality traits or needs.

Since she's not very trusting (Neutral) and tends to worry a lot (Strongly Disagree), but also isn't emotional, perhaps the ad's claims are too vague for her. It doesn't provide concrete evidence or detailed information, which she might need before believing it.

Her purchase intention: She has Neutral on making plans, so maybe not very decisive in buying decisions. But given her income and age, she might consider products that offer visible benefits like looking good. However, without trust in the ad's claims, her intent to buy is lower.

So for attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: Maybe a 3—she's Neutral on trusting ads but not strongly against them.
2. Interesting: 3 again; perhaps it's somewhat relevant but not compelling.
3. Good: 4, maybe it's okay but not great.
4. Attractive: 4, as it's neutral in appearance.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: 3—maybe not strong intent.
2. Try to buy: 4—might think about it if reminded again.
3. Consider buying: 5—could be on her mind but not a definite decision.
