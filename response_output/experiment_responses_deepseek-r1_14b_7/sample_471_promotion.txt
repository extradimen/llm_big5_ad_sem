Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score how much I like the ad and my intention to purchase the product based on the given 7-point scale.

First, let's break down my demographic profile. I'm from China, male, aged 50-59, have a bachelorâ€™s degree, am currently a student, divorced, and earn between 26,000,000 to 35,000,000 VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing but neutral on being reserved, disagree with being helpful and unselfish, neutral on trusting others, sometimes rude (Agree), not thorough in my work (Disagree), don't make plans or follow through well (Strongly Disagree), tend to be careless (Neutral), don't get nervous easily, don't worry a lot, lack emotional stability, have an inactive imagination, and am original with new ideas but have few artistic interests.

Given this, I'm a middle-aged man with a decent income, possibly looking for ways to stay active or presentable. My personality traits might affect how I perceive the ad's message.

The ad focuses on two main benefits: staying energized and looking your best daily. As someone in their 50s, energy levels might be a concern, so that part is relevant. Looking good could relate to social appearances, which might matter given my marital status and perhaps social life.

Looking at the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Considering my personality, I'm talkative but not very outgoing or reserved. However, being somewhat rude and careless might make me less likely to appreciate an ad that's too upbeat or pushy. The ad's message is positive but may come off as a bit generic. Since I don't get nervous easily and have a strong imagination (though the response was strongly disagree), I might find it unoriginal.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

My tendency to be careless and not make plans suggests that while the ad's message is appealing, my practical side might hold back from making a purchase immediately. However, considering my income level, I have the means to try new products but might need more convincing.

Putting it all together, I think the ad would get neutral to slightly below average scores for attitude because the benefits are good but the execution may not resonate with me personally. For purchase intention, it's a 3 out of 7 since I'm somewhat interested but not compelled to buy right away.
