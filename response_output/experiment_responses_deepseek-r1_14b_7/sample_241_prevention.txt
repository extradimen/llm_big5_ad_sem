Alright, I need to evaluate how a specific person would react to an advertisement. Let's break down the user's profile and personality traits first.

The individual is from China, male, under 20, has a bachelor’s degree, works as a civil servant, single, with a monthly income less than 15 million VND. Personality-wise, he's neutral on talkativeness, strongly disagrees being outgoing, neutral on reservedness, helpfulness, and unselfishness. He generally distrusts people but sometimes feels rude, does thorough work, makes plans but doesn't follow through much, isn't careless, rarely gets nervous, worries a lot, is emotionally stable, has an inactive imagination, neutral on originality, disagrees with having few artistic interests.

Now, the advertisement states: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with ad attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is talkative (neutral), outgoing (strongly disagree). He's reserved but not overly so. Since he doesn't consider himself outgoing or sociable, an ad that targets looking tired might appeal to his need to appear presentable, especially in a job setting. His tendency to worry a lot could make him concerned about appearing dull at work. So maybe the message resonates with him on a personal level. But his originality and imagination are low, so the ad's creativity might not stand out. Overall, maybe a 4.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad suggests consequences of not using the product—feeling tired and looking dull. Since he worries a lot, this could be compelling. But his neutral stance on imagination might mean he doesn't find it exceptionally interesting. Maybe a 5.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - For him to believe it, it needs to address his concerns. Worrying about appearing tired makes sense. The message is clear but perhaps not very engaging due to low originality. So maybe a 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on how well it speaks to him. If he's concerned about his appearance and performance, yes. But if the ad lacks creativity, maybe only a 5.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intention is low because while he might worry about appearing tired, his income is limited (under 15 million VND). He might not prioritize such a product over essentials. So probably a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it might be less likely unless the ad strongly influences him or there's an offer. Given his cautious nature and limited income, maybe a 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is possible since he worries about his image, but without strong motivation, it might not be top priority. Maybe a 5.

Wait, let me adjust: Since he's a civil servant, perhaps the need to present well is important. So maybe purchase intentions are slightly higher. But given his income constraints, he might be more cautious. 

Final scores:

Ad attitude: [4, 5, 4, 5]

Purchase intention: [3, 4, 5]
