Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad itself: It says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, evaluating my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - The message is clear about preventing tiredness and looking dull. However, it feels a bit negative and focuses on what happens without the product rather than highlighting the benefits of having it. I'm neutral on whether I like it because while the message is direct, it's not particularly engaging or positive.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The concept is straightforward but maybe not very original. It doesn't capture my interest much as someone who might be looking for a more inspiring or unique approach to staying energized. So, I'd rate this around 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is functional and gets the point across, but it's quite generic. Without any emotional appeal or creativity, I don't find it particularly compelling, so a 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The ad doesn't really stand out to me as visually or conceptually appealing. It's more of an informative message rather than something that draws me in with style or originality, hence a score of 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - While the ad highlights potential benefits like reducing tiredness and looking dull, it doesn't provide enough evidence or reasons why this drink is better than others. My skepticism as a careful consumer means I'm not immediately convinced, so a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - There's a slight interest because the ad addresses real concerns about energy levels and appearance. But without more information or a strong emotional hook, my willingness to try it is moderate, leading to a score of 5.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The message makes me think about whether I need such a drink, but I'm not fully convinced yet. So, I might add it to a list of options to consider, giving it a 4.
