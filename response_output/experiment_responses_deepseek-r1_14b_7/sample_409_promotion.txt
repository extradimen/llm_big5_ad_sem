Alright, let me try to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given profile. So, I'm a male from China over 60 years old with a high school education and currently a student. My monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which is pretty decent. 

Looking at the personality traits: I disagree that I'm talkative, neutral about being outgoing and reserved. I agree that I'm helpful and unselfish but strongly disagree that I'm trusting. I also strongly disagree with being sometimes rude. For work habits, I don't do thorough jobs, make plans, or follow through—so I strongly disagree there too. I tend to be careless and get nervous easily, which I agree with. My emotional stability is high, though. I have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often, and I don't have few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. Let's break this down. The key points are energy and appearance. 

First, considering my age—over 60—I might be more concerned about health and maybe not as focused on looking my best as younger people might be. But staying energized could be appealing because older adults often look for ways to maintain their vitality.

My personality traits: I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe the idea of looking good benefits others around me? Not sure if that ties in. The ad's emotional appeal is about looking good and having energy, which are positive attributes. But I'm not very trusting, so the credibility of the product matters to me.

I tend to be careless and get nervous easily—does this affect my response to ads? Maybe makes me more skeptical or less likely to trust the claims without evidence.

Emotionally stable—I might process the ad more logically than emotionally. Active imagination could make me visualize using the drink, but I'm not original in thinking about new ideas, so maybe I don't question the ad's message as much.

So, for attitude toward the ad: 

1. Like it? Not sure. It's a positive message, but I might not be personally motivated by looking my best. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting? It's a common ad theme, so maybe neutral—4.
3. Good? It has a positive message, but without specifics, maybe 5.
4. Attractive? The imagery and message could be appealing, so maybe 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase? Not sure; I might need more info. Maybe a 4.
2. Try it? Possibly, if I feel the benefits—maybe 5.
3. Consider buying? Yes, but not immediately—perhaps a 6.

Wait, no, maybe lower because of skepticism. Let me adjust:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 4, 5, 5]
Purchase intention: [4, 5, 6]

But I think I should be more critical since I'm skeptical and not very trusting. So perhaps lower the ad's scores.

Maybe like a 3, interesting as 3, good as 4, attractive as 4. Purchase intentions might all be around 4-5 but cautious.
