Alright, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement. So, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, looking at my background: I'm a young male from China with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant. My income is pretty high, around 26 to 35 million VND a month, which is significant. I live with my parents, so maybe family dynamics influence some of my purchasing decisions.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing and sociable but also reserved. That's an interesting mixâ€”maybe I balance being social but also value alone time. I tend to be helpful and unselfish, which might make me more considerate towards products that benefit others or society. However, I generally disagree with trusting people easily, so I might be skeptical of ads. I sometimes come off as rude, which could affect how I perceive the ad's approach. I'm not thorough in my work but am good at following through on plans and careful, which means I might look for clear and reliable information in ads.

Now, evaluating the ad: The message is about energy and looking good daily. For someone like me, staying energized could be appealing, especially since I have a demanding job as a civil servant. Looking good is also important, perhaps to maintain my professional image or social life.

Looking at each attitude question:
1. Do I like the ad? The claim seems straightforward, but with my reserved nature and tendency towards skepticism, I might not find it overly likable. Maybe around a 3.
2. Interesting? It's a common claim, so maybe not very interesting. Perhaps a 4.
3. Good? I think it's okay, but without strong emotional appeal, maybe a 5.
4. Attractive? The ad is simple and clear, which I appreciate, so maybe a 6.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Not sure yet; need more info. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy? If it's convenient, yes, but not a must-have. So another 3.
3. Consider buying? It's on my radar. Maybe a 4.

Overall, I'm moderately interested but not convinced without more evidence or personal relevance.
