Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down their background and personality first.

They're a Chinese male in his 40s with a bachelor's degree, single, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. He's talkative and outgoing but also reserved. He's helpful and trusting but sometimes disagrees with being rude. He does thorough work, makes plans, isn't careless, worries a lot, isn't stable emotionally, has an active imagination but few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

So, considering his personality, he's talkative and outgoing, which means social interactions are important to him. If the drink helps him stay energized and not look dull, that might appeal to him. He’s also planning-oriented, so maybe he likes products that help him maintain his routine.

But wait, he tends to worry a lot and is emotionally unstable. The ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull could play into his worries about social image. However, he's reserved, so maybe the overtone of needing to look good might not align with his personality as much.

He’s thorough but not careless, which suggests he values quality but isn't impulsive. So, if the ad is credible, it might influence him, but if he doesn’t see immediate value, he might be skeptical.

Looking at his traits towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** He's outgoing and likes social stuff, so an ad that helps him maintain energy and image might appeal to him. But being reserved, maybe not too much. Maybe a 4 or 5.
2. **Interesting.** It touches on tiredness and looking dull, which could be relatable but might feel a bit generic. Probably around a 3-4.
3. **Good.** The message is clear but might not be compelling enough for him to strongly agree it's good. Maybe a 3 or 4.
4. **Attractive.** If the ad is visually appealing, he might find it attractive, but if it's too over-the-top, maybe not. Let’s say a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.** He’s cautious and thorough, so unless convinced, he might not intend to buy immediately. Maybe a 2.
2. **Try to buy.** If the ad makes him curious, he might consider trying it, so maybe a 4.
3. **Consider buying.** The message is relevant enough that he could think about it, so maybe a 5.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact scores, but considering all factors, I'd say the ad_type is "prevention" because it's focusing on preventing tiredness and dull looks, which aligns with health and image maintenance.
