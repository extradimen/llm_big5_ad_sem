Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **Like the ad (score: 2):** The ad is pretty straightforward but doesn't really connect with me on a personal level. It seems generic and not tailored to my interests or lifestyle.

2. **Interesting (score: 3):** While it's not bad, there's nothing particularly engaging about the message. I don't feel any emotional connection or excitement from this ad.

3. **Good (score: 4):** The ad is functional; it conveys a clear benefit of staying energized and looking good. However, it doesn't go above and beyond in creativity or appeal to me personally.

4. **Attractive (score: 3):** The visuals might be okay, but without more compelling imagery or storytelling, the ad isn't particularly attractive to me.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase (score: 2):** I don't have a strong desire to buy this product. There's no unique selling point that stands out to me.

2. **Try to buy (score: 3):** If the product were recommended or if I saw it in-store, I might consider trying it once, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

3. **Consider buying (score: 4):** Given that I'm single and looking for an energizing drink, maybe I would think about purchasing it if there's a promotion or good reviews. However, this is a lower priority for me.
