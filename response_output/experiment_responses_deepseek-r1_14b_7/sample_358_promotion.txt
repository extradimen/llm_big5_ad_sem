Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude: 

1. **I like the ad. (2/7)**  
   The ad is positive and presents benefits like energy and looking good, which are appealing. However, the message feels a bit generic and overused in ads, making it less exciting for me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7)**  
   While the concepts of staying energized and looking good are important, the ad doesn't offer anything unique or new. It's predictable, so it doesn't capture my interest as much.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**  
   The ad does a decent job by highlighting positive attributes that people care about. However, without specific details or proof of effectiveness, my belief in its quality is moderate.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**  
   The visuals and message are pleasant, but they lack depth. It could be more compelling with more engaging content or emotional appeal.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   There's a slight interest due to the benefits mentioned, but without personal experience or additional information, I'm not fully convinced to buy it.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   The ad makes me consider trying it once, especially if it offers noticeable results. However, there's no strong incentive or evidence provided to push for an immediate purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   I'm open to the idea of purchasing it because it aligns with my desire for energy and personal grooming. Itâ€™s on my radar but not a top priority without more info.
