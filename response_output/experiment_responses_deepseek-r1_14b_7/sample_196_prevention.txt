Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down their profile first.

They're from China, male, aged 50-59, with a bachelor's degree and currently a student. That means they might have some disposable income given their monthly income range of 26 million to 35 million VND, which is about $1,100 to $1,500 USD. They're single, so maybe family isn't the main focus here.

Looking at personality traits: They disagree with being talkative and outgoing, strongly disagree with being reserved, but strongly agree with being helpful and unselfish. That's interesting because it suggests they value social responsibility but might not be the most extroverted person. They generally don't trust much, which could make them cautious about ads. They also don't tend to be rude, do thorough jobs, make plans and follow through, so they're probably organized and detail-oriented. They aren't careless, get nervous easily is neutral, worry a lot is strongly disagree, so maybe not very anxious. They are emotionally stable, have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often, and have few artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. Given his age group, he might be looking for ways to maintain energy levels or perhaps look good in social settings.

Now, evaluating the ad: Since he is single, a student with some income, maybe he has social interactions where looking tired could affect his image. The drink's promise to prevent feeling tired and looking dull could appeal to him if he values these aspects.

Looking at his personality: He's helpful and unselfish, which might make him consider how this product can help others or himself in a way that benefits society, but the ad is more about personal appearance and energy. Since he doesn't find ads particularly trustworthy (general distrust), he might be skeptical of the claims unless they're backed by something credible.

He tends to do thorough jobs and plan things through, so if this drink helps him maintain his routine without feeling tired, it could be appealing. However, he isn't someone who comes up with new ideas or has strong artistic interests, so maybe the ad's message is straightforward but not overly creative, which might make it less engaging for him.

His emotional stability and being neutral on imagination suggest he might not be swayed by emotionally manipulative ads but prefers clear, factual information. The ad here seems to focus on potential negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull) without offering positive imagery or benefits beyond that.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: He's moderately interested but not overly excited. It's interesting because it addresses real concerns about energy and appearance, which are relatable. However, his skepticism might make him question the effectiveness of the drink unless there's evidence provided.

Purchase intention: Since he does thorough jobs and follows through with plans, if he decides to try something, he might be more committed. But given his cautious nature towards trusting ads, initial intent might not be very high. Trying it could depend on whether others recommend it or if there's some credible proof. Considering buying it would require more information or a compelling reason.

So, putting it all together: He sees the ad as somewhat interesting and good but not extremely so. The attraction is there, but not strong. For purchase intentions, he's slightly interested in trying and considering, but not fully committed without more evidence.
