Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 40-49-year-old Chinese civil servant with certain personality traits. Let's break down each part.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like it? The message is about energy and looking good. As a busy civil servant, staying energized is important. But the wording feels a bit generic. It doesn't inspire me much. Maybe 4/7.

2. Is it interesting? Not particularly. It's similar to many other drink ads. Doesn't stand out. So maybe 3/7.

3. Do I think it's good? The claims are positive, but without specific benefits or evidence, it feels a bit vague. So perhaps 3/7.

4. Is it attractive? Maybe not very because there's no strong emotional appeal or unique angle. So around 3/7.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm cautious with health products. Without seeing proof of effectiveness, I'm not sure. Maybe 3/7.

2. Will try to buy: Since it's a drink, convenience is key. But without strong reasons, maybe neutral, like 4/7.

3. Consider buying: It might be an option if others recommend it. So perhaps 5/7.
