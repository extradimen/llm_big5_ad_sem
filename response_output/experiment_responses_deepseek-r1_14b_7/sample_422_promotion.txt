Alright, let me break down my thought process for evaluating this advertisement. 

First, the ad is targeting a person like meâ€”a 40- to 49-year-old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working in an office, who's divorced and earns around 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being neutral about talking, disagreeing on being outgoing or reserved, agreeing on sometimes being rude, strongly disagreeing on thoroughness and making plans, strongly disagreeing on carelessness, agreeing on getting nervous easily, strongly agreeing on worrying a lot, disagreeing on emotional stability, and agreeing on having an active imagination and originality while strongly agreeing on few artistic interests.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For the ad's attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** I'm a bit of a worrier, so ads that promise daily benefits might appeal to my desire for stability. However, being reserved and not too outgoing, I'm not sure if this ad resonates with me on an emotional level. Maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone in their 40s. It might tap into my wish to maintain vitality. So, I'd rate it a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** I'm skeptical about such claims because they often seem too good to be true. My tendency to worry makes me question the product's effectiveness. Maybe a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The message is positive, but since I don't have strong artistic interests and prefer more practical information, the ad might not be visually or conceptually appealing enough for an 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My skepticism about advertising claims makes me less likely to buy immediately. So, a low score like 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's some appeal, but without more evidence or personal need, I'm not sure. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's something I might think about if the product is recommended elsewhere, so perhaps a 4.
