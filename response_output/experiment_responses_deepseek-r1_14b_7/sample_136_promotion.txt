Alright, let me go through this step by step. First, I need to evaluate the advertisement from the perspective of a person with the given demographic and personality traits.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - Hmm, considering my personality, I'm reserved (Agree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), and have few artistic interests (Agree). The ad is positive but might feel too upbeat for someone reserved. Maybe not something I'd particularly like. So maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Interesting could mean it's engaging or new. However, since I'm more reserved and possibly less exposed to such ads, I might find it neutral, so perhaps a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Believing in the ad's message would depend on trust. I generally disagree with being trusting, so maybe not believing much. A 3 here.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Attractiveness might relate to visual appeal or catchiness. Since I have few artistic interests, perhaps it's neutral, so a 4.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My monthly income is on the higher side (26-35 million VND), but as a blue-collar worker, maybe saving money is important. Also, I tend to be careless and get nervous easily. The ad's benefits are good, but not sure if it's convincing enough. Maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Trying might require some persuasion. Given my cautious nature and the ad's claims, perhaps a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering is more neutral; I'm not against it but not convinced either. Maybe a 4 here.
