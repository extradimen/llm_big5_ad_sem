Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (2)**: The advertisement claims it helps stay energized and look good. While those are appealing benefits, my personality traits make me cautious. I'm reserved and sometimes get nervous easily, which makes me skeptical of such claims. Plus, I worry about the product's effectiveness, so I don't feel a strong connection or like towards it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (3)**: The message isn't uninteresting, but it doesn't really catch my attention either. My active imagination and originality make me look for more creative ads. This one feels generic, so it's just somewhat interesting to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (2)**: Believing in an ad requires trust, which I'm neutral on. The product's benefits are mentioned vaguely, without specifics or evidence, making it hard for me to fully trust the claims. My tendency towards skepticism here makes me give a low score.

4. **I find the ad attractive (3)**: While not unattractive, it doesn't stand out enough for me. I don't see anything that really draws me in or resonates with my preferences or lifestyle, so it's just slightly above neutral.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (2)**: My cautious nature and tendency to worry make me hesitant to buy something based solely on an ad. Without more information or a strong reason, I don't feel compelled to buy it.

2. **I will try to buy this product (3)**: There's a small curiosity here. The benefits mentioned might appeal to my desire for energy and looking good, but without trying it, I'm not sure if it works, so I'm somewhat inclined to consider it.

3. **I will consider buying this product (4)**: Considering is the middle ground between intent and mere thought. While I'm not actively planning to buy, the ad does touch on things that could be relevant, so it's something I might think about in the future if reminded again.

Overall, my skepticism, reserved nature, and cautiousness make me less likely to be swayed by this ad, but there's a small consideration factor due to the product's benefits.
