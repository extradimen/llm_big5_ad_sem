Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Neutral (4/7): The ad mentions staying energized and looking best, which are positive benefits but don't resonate deeply with my personality. Since I'm not particularly outgoing or talkative, the appeal to energy levels isn't a strong draw for me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Neutral (4/7): The message is clear, but without any emotional hooks that match my traits, it doesn't capture my interest beyond surface level.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Slightly Disagree (3/7): While the ad effectively communicates its benefits, I don't find it particularly compelling given my personality traits like being reserved and sometimes rude, which might make me less influenced by positive, energizing messages.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Neutral (4/7): The visual and message are okay, but nothing stands out to make me strongly attracted to it.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Slightly Disagree (3/7): I'm more practical and might not feel the need for such a product unless convinced by other factors like necessity or strong evidence.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Neutral (4/7): There's some consideration, but without strong motivation, it's on the fence.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Agree (5/7): The benefits are clear, so I might think about it, especially if convenience is a factor.
