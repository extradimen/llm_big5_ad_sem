Alright, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement based on my given profile. So first, I need to understand the ad: it's a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. 

Looking at my personality traits, I'm outgoing but sometimes rude. I agree with being helpful, but I don't trust people easily. I make plans and follow through, so maybe that's relevant for purchasing intentions.

For the ad attitude scores:

1. I like the ad: Well, the ad is promoting a drink that keeps you energized and looking good. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe staying energized is important. But I'm not very talkative, so maybe the social aspect isn't as appealing to me. However, being outgoing, I might appreciate something that helps me look my best. So, maybe 3 or 4.

2. Interesting: The benefits are clearâ€”energy and appearance. It seems straightforward but perhaps not very exciting. Maybe a 3 or 4.

3. Good: It makes sense as an ad because it highlights practical benefits. But I'm not sure if the message is compelling enough. Maybe around 4 or 5.

4. Attractive: The ad's visuals and message could be attractive to someone who values looking good and staying energized. If the design is appealing, maybe a higher score like 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm not in the habit of buying such products regularly. Plus, my income is less than 15 million VND, so maybe budget constraints come into play. Perhaps a low score like 2 or 3.

2. Try to buy: Maybe if it's recommended by others or if I see positive reviews, I might consider trying it once. So, around 4.

3. Consider buying: If the product seems effective and is within my price range, I would think about it. Perhaps a 5.

I'm not entirely sure about these scores, but considering my traits, the ad's appeal to energy and appearance might resonate somewhat, but my cautious nature and lower income could temper my willingness to purchase.
