Alright, let's break down how I arrived at my scores. Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The ad is quite generic and doesn't tap into any of my personal values or interests. Since I'm reserved and have few artistic interests, it doesn't connect with me on a personal level. So, I scored this a 2.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   It's not particularly engaging given my personality traits. I don't find it captivating, so another 2 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   The message isn't compelling enough to make me trust or believe in the product. My skepticism towards ads and being strongly disagreeable with trusting people makes this a low score of 1.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Visual appeal might be there, but since I'm not outgoing or talkative, it doesn't attract me much. A 2 seems fair.

Moving on to purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   With my high income and managerial role, I might have the means, but the ad's lack of appeal and trustworthiness don't drive me to action. So, a 3 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Even though I'm curious about its benefits, the advertisement didn't resonate enough with my personality or lifestyle. Another 3 feels right.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Given that I worry about products being effective and have a tendency to be careless with purchases, I might think twice before trying it. A 4 reflects some consideration but not strong intent.
