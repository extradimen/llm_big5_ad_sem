Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**  
   The ad seems too generic and doesn't connect with my personality. While I'm outgoing and talkative, I don't feel energized by this message. It lacks anything that excites me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**  
   There's some interest because it mentions staying energized and looking good, which are relatable. However, the execution isn't engaging enough for my taste.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**  
   It conveys clear benefits but doesn't go into specifics. I'm more of a critical thinker, so without detailed information, it's hard to fully trust the claim.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (3/7)**  
   The visuals and message are okay, but they don't align with my active and imaginative nature. It feels too surface-level.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   There's a small chance if the price is right, but I'm skeptical of its effectiveness based on the ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   If someone recommends it or there's a discount, I might give it a shot, but it's not a priority.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The benefits are appealing, so I would think about it, especially if reminded by other factors like availability or price.
