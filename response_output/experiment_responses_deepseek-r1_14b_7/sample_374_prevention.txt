Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad's message is clear about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm talkative and outgoing, I appreciate straightforward messaging that emphasizes energy and appearance. However, it doesn't resonate on a deeper level, so a 5 feels right.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, especially in social settings. It's not overly engaging, but it does touch on common concerns, so I'll rate it a 6.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The message is clear and directly targets the issues people face with fatigue and appearance. However, it lacks emotional depth or creativity to make me strongly believe in its effectiveness. A 5 seems appropriate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** While the idea is appealing, the execution is pretty generic. It doesn't stand out visually or emotionally, so I'll give it a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** The ad makes a valid point about energy and appearance, but I don't feel strongly compelled to buy it immediately. A 5 reflects that middle ground.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's some interest because the benefits are clear, but without more information or personal need, I'm not sure I'll actively seek it out. So a 4 fits here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It definitely makes me think about whether this drink could be useful, especially in situations where I need to stay alert and presentable. That's a solid 6.
