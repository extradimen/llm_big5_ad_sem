Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese postgraduate student working in an office and living in my region. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with the ad's attitude scores:

1. **Like**: I'm talkative and outgoing, so ads that highlight social aspects might appeal to me. This ad talks about not feeling tired and looking dull, which are concerns for someone in a busy office job. It seems relevant because it addresses energy and appearance, which are important for making a good impression. So maybe a 6.

2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but perhaps a bit generic. I'm analytical and thorough, so I might not find it very interesting unless there's more detail about how the drink helps specifically. Maybe a 5.

3. **Good**: Itâ€™s trying to connect with my desire to look good and feel energetic, which are important for someone in an office setting. But it feels a bit overused as an ad message. I'm not sure if it's unique enough, so maybe a 4.

4. **Attractive**: The imagery of looking tired versus refreshed could be attractive. It plays into my concerns about making a good impression at work. Maybe a 5 or 6? Let me go with 5 because while the concept is good, the execution might not stand out enough.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: I'm cautious and sometimes worry a lot, so trying new products isn't my first instinct. However, if the ad makes me think it's effective, maybe I would consider it. But without more info, perhaps a 5.

2. **Try to buy**: Since I'm thorough, I might want to read reviews or see evidence before trying it. So maybe not a strong intent yet, like a 4.

3. **Consider buying**: It does make me think about the product's benefits, so I would at least consider it when I have more info. Maybe a 5.

Putting it all together, my scores might be:

Ad attitude: [6,5,4,5]
Purchase intention: [5,4,5]

But wait, I need to make sure each score is within 1-7 and reflects how I feel based on the traits provided. Since I'm talkative and outgoing, maybe the "like" should be higher. Similarly, if it's about looking good, maybe "attractive" is a 6. Adjusting:

Ad attitude: [6,5,4,6]
Purchase intention: [5,4,5]

But in my initial thought, I considered some points where the scores might vary based on other traits like being analytical and cautious.
