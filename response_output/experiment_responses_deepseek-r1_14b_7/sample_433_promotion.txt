Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, looking at the ad: it's about a drink that keeps you energized and helps you look your best daily. 

Starting with my attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**: The message is positive but seems a bit generic. While I appreciate the idea of staying energized and looking good, I don't feel a strong connection to it because it's not tailored to me specifically. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept is straightforward—energy and appearance—but it doesn't capture my interest much. It feels more like a typical marketing slogan than something unique. A 3 here too.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: For an ad to be believable, I need some evidence or specific benefits. The ad lacks details about how the drink actually works or any scientific backing. That makes it hard for me to fully trust its claims. So, a 4 might be fair since it's somewhat positive but not convincing.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Visual appeal and creativity can make an ad stand out. Without knowing the visuals, I assume it follows standard designs which might not be very engaging. A neutral score of 4 seems right.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My monthly income is around 36-45 million VND, so I can afford such products. However, the ad doesn't provide enough reasons why I should choose this drink over others. Without specific benefits or a compelling reason, my intent isn't strong—maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Trying new things is okay, but again, without clear incentives or information on what makes this drink unique, I'm not motivated to try it. A 3 seems appropriate.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While considering is better than outright dismissal, the lack of detailed benefits means it's not a top priority for me. So, a 4 because while I won't rush to buy, I might think about it if reminded again.
