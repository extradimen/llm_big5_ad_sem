Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let me break it down step by step.

First, her demographics: she's a Chinese woman in her late twenties, has a bachelor’s degree, works in an office, is divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Strongly Disagree), helpful but neutral on selfishness, generally not trusting (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Agree), not thorough in her work (Disagree), neutral on making plans, careless (Agree), gets nervous easily (Agree), doesn't worry much (Disagree), emotionally stable (Neutral), has an active imagination and is original with ideas (Agree), and neutral on artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to stay alert and presentable.

Considering her personality, she's outgoing and sociable. That means she probably values looking good and feeling energetic in social situations. However, she is sometimes rude (Agree) and careless (Agree), which might make her not overly concerned with minor inconveniences like tiredness unless it affects her social life directly.

She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas. Maybe the ad's message resonates because she's someone who likes to think about how products can help her in real-life scenarios, especially in maintaining her image.

On the other hand, she's not very trusting (Strongly Disagree) of others, so she might be skeptical of such claims. Also, being a bit careless and sometimes rude, she might not see the need for an extra drink to stay alert unless she's already feeling the effects.

Her occupation as an office worker suggests she might have a busy schedule, but her income is less than 15 million VND, which is on the lower end in Vietnam. This could affect her willingness to spend on such products unless she sees clear benefits.

Evaluating the ad's appeal: The message is about preventing tiredness and dull looks. If she values looking good and being energetic for social interactions, the ad might be somewhat appealing. However, since she doesn't trust others much, she might question the effectiveness of the drink without more evidence or a strong recommendation.

For purchase intention: She tends to be careless and sometimes makes plans but follows through neutrally. So while the ad might catch her attention, her tendency towards carelessness and skepticism could make her less likely to intend buying it immediately. However, if she does experience tiredness, she might consider trying it.

Putting this together, her态度 towards the ad would probably be neutral to slightly positive, but her purchase intention is lower because of her personality traits like skepticism and carelessness.
