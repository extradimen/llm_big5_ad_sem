Alright, I need to figure out how to score my attitude towards this ad and my purchase intentions based on the given advertisement and my demographic and personality traits.

The advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down what each part of the ad is conveying. The drink claims to provide energy and improve appearance daily. So it's targeting people looking for a quick energy boost and maybe something that can help them look better, perhaps for work or social situations.

Looking at my demographic profile: I'm a married office worker in China with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income between 16,000,000–25,000 VND. That's about $700 to $1,100 USD. Given that, I might be part of the middle to upper-middle class in Vietnam. My job as an office worker likely requires me to stay alert and presentable, so a drink that helps with energy and appearance could be appealing.

Now, considering my personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree – Maybe I value social interactions and products that help me maintain a good image.
- Outgoing: Agree – Similar to above.
- Reserved: Neutral – Not too introverted or extroverted.
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree – So maybe not very community-oriented, more self-focused.
- Trusting: Neutral – Neither overly trusting nor skeptical.
- Rude sometimes: Neutral – Doesn't affect this ad much.
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree – Not someone who pays attention to details; might not trust products that make broad claims.
- Make plans/follow through: Neutral – Unpredictable in commitment.
- Careless: Disagree – Somewhat careful but not overly.
- Nervous easily: Strongly Disagree – Calm under pressure.
- Worry a lot: Disagree – Not a chronic worrier.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral – Stable enough, so ads that don't cause stress might be okay.
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree – I like creative ideas and products that offer something unique.
- Original/new ideas: Disagree – Maybe not as innovative in approach but open to new things.
- Artistic interests: Strongly Disagree – Not into artsy stuff.

So, the ad is trying to appeal to someone who wants energy and a good look. My personality leans towards being talkative and outgoing, which might make me care about how I present myself socially. However, my disagree with helpfulness and unselfishness suggests I'm more self-focused, so maybe the ad's message aligns with that.

I have a strong imagination but am not particularly original in my ideas. The drink's claim to help look good every day might appeal to me if I value daily grooming or social presentation.

On the negative side, my disagreement with thoroughness and tendency towards being careless could make me skeptical of broad claims. Also, being emotionally stable might mean I don't get overly excited by ads but also not dismissive.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. Do I like it? The message is positive but maybe a bit too general. With my active imagination, creative ads are good, but this one seems straightforward. I'm neutral here.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim for energy drinks, so maybe not very interesting or unique. Neutral again.
3. Good: Does the ad effectively convey its message? It's clear but lacks depth. Maybe a 4 since it's functional but not outstanding.
4. Attractive: Visuals and messaging matter. If the ad is visually appealing with a catchy slogan, I might find it attractive. Let's say 5.

For purchase intentions:

1. Intend to buy: The claims are tempting, especially for energy and appearance, which align with my social needs. But skepticism about effectiveness due to being thorough? Maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: Slightly lower than intention because I might wait for reviews or try once. Perhaps a 5.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on my radar; considering it as an option. So, 6.

Putting it all together:
