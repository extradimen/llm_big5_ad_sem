Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: It focuses on preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Given my personality traits, I'm talkative but not very outgoing, so social image is somewhat important to me. However, my tendency towards being careless might make me overlook the need for such products. Also, I generally don't trust people much, which could affect how credible I find the ad.

For the first part, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The message is clear but might be too generic. It doesn't resonate strongly with me since I'm not overly concerned about looking dull. So, a 3.
2. **Interesting.** - Not particularly interesting because it's a common claim in energy drinks. Maybe a 4.
3. **Good.** - The execution is okay, but the claims are typical. A middle score of 5.
4. **Attractive.** - The visuals and message might not be enough to attract me. So, a 4.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.** - I'm cautious about new products and don't feel strongly convinced by the ad. A 3.
2. **Try to buy.** - Maybe if it's recommended elsewhere or during a sale. Still a 4.
3. **Consider buying.** - It might cross my mind, but not enough to act on immediately. A 5.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly persuade me due to trust issues and a laid-back attitude towards such products.
