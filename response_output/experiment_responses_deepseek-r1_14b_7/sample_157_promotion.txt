Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores step by step.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad is straightforward but lacks depth in emotional appeal for someone reserved and introverted like me. It doesn't resonate on a personal level.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - While it provides information about staying energized and looking good, it's not engaging enough to capture my interest due to its generic nature.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is clear, but without any compelling emotional or personal connection, I don't find it particularly persuasive.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Visually and stylistically, ads can vary, but since there's no specific info on that here, I assume it's average. My reserved nature doesn't find it particularly attractive either.

Next, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Given my tendency to be careful with spending and not feeling a strong need for this product, the intention is low.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without strong motivation or trust in the ad's claims, I'm unlikely to make an effort to purchase it.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - While I acknowledge the benefits mentioned, my cautious nature makes me hesitant without more evidence or personal need.
