Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: 

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive benefits. However, considering my personality traits, being reserved (Strongly Disagree) might make me less likely to connect emotionally with such ads. Also, since I'm talkative but neutral, maybe the message isn't personally resonant enough for me to like it. So, a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The benefits are clear, but I don't find them particularly compelling given my current lifestyle and priorities. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: It's well-crafted with positive messages, but I'm not entirely convinced it's excellent or stands out among others. A 5 here.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visuals might be appealing, but without specific details about how the drink works, it doesn't grab me strongly. So, a 6 is okay.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: I have a high income, but my helpfulness and being unselfish (Strongly Disagree) might make me less inclined to buy something that seems more about appearance than necessity. A 3 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some interest in the benefits, but without strong motivation, I'm not sure. A 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's on my radar, but not a top priority. So, a 5.
