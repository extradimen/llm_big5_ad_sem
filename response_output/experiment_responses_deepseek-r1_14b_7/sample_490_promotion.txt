Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their given profile. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target demographic is a 50-59-year-old married man from China with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 26â€“35 million VND. He's reserved, helpful, not very trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in his work, makes plans, isn't careless, doesn't get nervous easily, worries a lot, is emotionally stable (neutral), has few artistic interests but is original with new ideas.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. I like the ad. - He's reserved and maybe values practicality over emotional appeals. The ad focuses on energy and appearance. Since he's in his 50s, staying energized might be appealing, but "look your best" could be seen as superficial. His reserved nature might make him not strongly like it, so maybe a 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting. - He worries a lot, so maybe finds value in health and appearance products. The message seems relevant for someone his age looking to stay active and presentable. However, he's not very trusting, so maybe the ad's claims are seen as too good to be true. A 4?

3. I believe the ad is good. - He's thorough and plans ahead, which might make him consider products that aid in daily functioning. But being sometimes rude and not trusting could make him skeptical of such ads. Maybe a 5.

4. I find the ad attractive. - As an older male, maybe he's more focused on practical benefits rather than the attractiveness of the ad itself. He might see it as functional but not necessarily appealing. So perhaps a 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - He's thorough and makes plans, which suggests he would consider products that aid in his routine. However, being reserved and possibly skeptical of the claims, he might not feel compelled to buy immediately. Maybe a 4.

2. I will try to buy this product. - Given his thorough nature, he might be willing to try it after some consideration, but again, skepticism could hold him back. Perhaps a 3.

3. I will consider buying this product. - Definitely, since the ad speaks to staying energized and looking good, which are relevant for someone in that age group. He'll weigh the options. So maybe a 5.

Wait, let me reconsider some scores. For the ad attitude, he might not find it extremely interesting or believe it strongly because of his skepticism (he disagrees with being trusting). So perhaps lower the 'interesting' score to 3 and 'good' to 4. Similarly, for purchase intention, his thoroughness could mean he's more likely to consider it, so maybe 'intend' is higher than I thought.

Alternatively, considering he worries a lot, health-related products might be of interest, making him more inclined. So perhaps:

Ad attitude: 3, 3, 4, 3.

Purchase intention: 5, 5, 6? Hmm, but the scale goes up to 7. Maybe not that high because of skepticism. Let's say 4 for intend, 4 for try, 5 for consider.
