Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

The individual is from China, male, under 20 years old, has a postgraduate degree, works as a civil servant, is divorced, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income for someone in that demographic. Now, looking at their personality traits:

- They strongly disagree with being talkative and outgoing, so they're probably quite reserved.
- They are helpful but not overly unselfish, leaning towards neutral on that.
- They generally trust others, which is agree.
- They sometimes feel rude, but only disagree, so maybe not often.
- They do thorough jobs, make plans and follow through, so they're organized.
- They tend to be careless, strongly agree, which might mean they aren't too detail-oriented or careful in their actions.
- They don't get nervous easily and don't worry a lot, so they're pretty calm.
- Emotionally stable? Strongly disagree. So maybe they have mood swings or are more volatile.
- Don't have an active imagination or original ideas, so they might not be very creative.
- Have few artistic interests, disagree, meaning they do have some interest in art.

So the ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. It's targeting someone looking for energy and possibly good looks as part of their daily routine.

Given his reserved nature, maybe he wouldn't find the ad too appealing if it's very outgoing or social. But since he's a civil servant with a high income, perhaps he's interested in maintaining a good appearance. The drink is positioned as something that can help with energy and looking good, which could be important for someone in his professional role.

However, his tendency to be careless might mean he isn't too focused on such products unless they offer significant benefits. His strong disagreement with being talkative or outgoing suggests he's more introverted, so ads that rely on socializing might not resonate.

He is organized and makes plans, so if the ad presents the drink as something that fits into a daily routine, that could be appealing. But his emotional instability (strongly disagree) might make him less likely to trust the ad's claims without evidence.

His lack of imagination and originality might mean he doesn't see the unique benefits of the product unless it's clearly presented. Also, his income is high, so maybe he can afford such products, but his personality traits might not align with the typical target for this kind of drink.

So, evaluating the ad: whether it's liked, interesting, good, and attractive. Given his reserved nature, he might not find it very exciting (lower score). But if the ad emphasizes the functional benefits like energy and appearance without being overly social or outgoing, he might see some value.

For purchase intention: He is thorough but careless, so maybe he would consider trying it once but might not intend to buy regularly unless convinced of its effectiveness. His high income could mean he's more willing to spend on such products if they seem beneficial.

Putting this together, his scores for the ad attitude and purchase intentions would likely be moderate. He doesn't strongly dislike or love the ad, and is somewhat interested in purchasing but not entirely sure.
