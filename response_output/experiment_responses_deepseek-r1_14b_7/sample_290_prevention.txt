Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, the ad targets someone who might feel tired and look dull without the drink. Given my outgoing nature and being a civil servant, looking presentable is important. The ad's message aligns with that need, so I find it relevant and somewhat interesting.

However, the wording seems a bit manipulative. It uses fear of appearing tired or dull, which might not be the most appealing approach to me since I prefer ads that highlight benefits rather than create anxiety. Therefore, my score for liking the ad is lower at 3.

For purchase intention, while the message resonates on some level, I'm cautious about health products. The ad doesn't provide evidence or specific benefits, so my intent isn't very high. Trying it would require more information, hence a 4. Considering buying it is moderate since there's some interest but not enough to push for an immediate purchase, scoring 5.

Overall, the ad has potential but lacks in transparency and compelling details, affecting both my attitude towards it and my likelihood to buy.
