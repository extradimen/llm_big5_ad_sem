Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the demographic profile:

- Region: Chinese
- Gender: Female
- Age: <20 (so a young adult)
- Education: Bachelor’s degree
- Occupation: Managerial employee (which is interesting for someone under 20)
- Marital status: Divorced
- Monthly income: 26,000,000–35,000,000 VND (~$1,100 to $1,500 USD). That's a decent income for Vietnam.

Personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree → She likes talking and engaging.
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree → She is somewhat social but not extremely so.
- Reserved: Neutral → She’s neither overly reserved nor outgoing beyond her current level.
- Helpful/unselfish with others: Disagree → Maybe she's more self-focused or less inclined to help others.
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree → She doesn't trust people easily, which could make her skeptical of ads.
- Sometimes rude: Agree → She might not always be polite, which could affect how she views the ad if it seems pushy.
- Thorough job: Agree → She's detail-oriented and thorough in her work.
- Makes plans/follows through: Neutral → Planning isn't a strong suit or maybe inconsistent.
- Careless: Disagree → She’s careful, so ads that don’t provide enough info might not appeal to her.
- Nervous easily: Agree → She gets nervous, which could make her more cautious with purchases.
- Worry a lot: Neutral → Not overly anxious but sometimes does.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree → She's steady emotionally, so ads that are too emotional might not connect.
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree → Creative and imaginative.
- Original/new ideas: Neutral → Doesn’t particularly stand out as innovative or traditional.
- Artistic interests: Agree → Maybe she has some interest in art but it's more of an agree stance.

Now, the ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

I need to evaluate how this person would respond. Let's go through each part.

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. I like the ad.
2. Interesting.
3. Good.
4. Attractive.

Factors influencing her:

- She is talkative and outgoing, so ads that emphasize social aspects might resonate. The ad talks about looking your best, which could appeal to someone who values their appearance and wants to stay energized, perhaps for social interactions.

- She is detail-oriented (thorough job) but also somewhat trusting? Wait, no—she strongly disagrees with being generally trusting. So she's skeptical of claims made in ads. The ad makes specific health-related claims without any evidence shown, which might make her question their validity.

- She has an active imagination and is original, so maybe the ad needs to be creative or unique to catch her attention. If the ad is just another generic energy drink ad, she might not find it interesting.

- She is emotionally stable but gets nervous easily. So ads that are too high-energy or pushy might not appeal; instead, something calm and factual might work better.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. Intend to purchase.
2. Will try to buy.
3. Consider buying.

Factors:

- Her monthly income is decent, so she can afford such products if they seem valuable. However, given her skepticism (disagree with trusting ads), she might need more convincing before purchasing.

- The ad's claims are about energy and looking good. If she values these outcomes highly, it could influence her. But since she's detail-oriented, she might look for more information or reviews before deciding.

Now, let's assign scores step by step.

**Ad Attitude:**
1. Like the ad: Since she's talkative and outgoing, the idea of looking good and staying energized might appeal to her social side. However, her skepticism (disagree with trusting) makes her less likely to like it without evidence. Maybe a 4 or 5? But since she is detail-oriented and the ad seems vague, maybe lower. Let's say 3.

Wait, but she has an active imagination and likes creative things. If the ad is creatively presented, she might find it more likable. Alternatively, if the ad is just generic, she might not like it much. Maybe a middle score—4.

2. Interesting: The claims are about energy and appearance, which are common in ads. But with her active imagination, if the ad is creative, maybe 5 or 6. But without more info, perhaps 4.

3. Good: This depends on how truthful she finds it. Since she's skeptical, unless the ad provides evidence or resonates with her values, maybe a lower score. Let's say 4.

4. Attractive: If the visuals and presentation are appealing, maybe higher. But since she's not very trusting, perhaps 5 if it looks good but isn't overly persuasive.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe let me think again.

She is talkative, so an ad that emphasizes social benefits (looking best for parties or meetings) might be interesting. She has an active imagination—so a creative and engaging ad could make her find it more attractive. However, she's not trusting of ads, which would lower her perception of the ad as good or likeable.

So perhaps:

1. Like: 4
2. Interesting: 5 (since energy and looking good are relevant)
3. Good: 3 (because skeptical about claims)
4. Attractive: 5 if visuals are good, else 4

But since it's just the text given, maybe she wouldn't find it as attractive visually unless described otherwise.

Alternatively, considering her personality:

- Talkative and outgoing → ad should be engaging.
- High imagination → creative elements would make it more interesting.
- Skeptical of ads → so 'good' might be lower.

But without specific visuals, perhaps the text is neutral. So maybe:

1. Like: 3 (neutral)
2. Interesting: 5
3. Good: 4 (because the message is positive but not necessarily truthful in her eyes)
4. Attractive: 4 (if not visually appealing)

Wait, she has an active imagination—so even without visuals, the ad could be interesting because it's imaginative. So maybe:

1. Like: 4
2. Interesting: 5 or 6
3. Good: 4
4. Attractive: 4

But I'm not sure.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: High skepticism and unless she sees value, maybe low intent.
2. Will try: Maybe neutral but if the ad makes her curious, higher.
3. Consider: She's thorough, so she might consider it but needs more info.

But considering her income allows her to afford it, she might be open to trying it if the claims resonate with her.

Perhaps:

1. Intend: 3 (maybe)
2. Try: 4
3. Consider: 5

Wait, but she's detail-oriented and thorough, so unless she's convinced, she won't intend to buy. So maybe lower scores.

Alternatively:

1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 4
3. Consider: 5 (since she's careful and would think about it)

I'm a bit torn here because without more context, it's hard to say exactly.
