Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score my attitude toward the ad and my purchase intention on a 7-point scale based on my profile.

Demographics:
- I'm from China, female, in my 30s, have a postgraduate degree, am a student, married, with a monthly income of 26–35 million VND. That's about $1,100–$1,500 USD, which is a decent middle-class income.

Personality traits:
- I disagree that I'm talkative and strongly disagree being outgoing and sociable. So, I'm more reserved.
- I'm helpful and unselfish, so I care about others but might not be the most assertive in social settings.
- Neutral on trusting people, sometimes rude (but I scored agree on this), thorough in my work, strongly disagree with making plans and following through—so maybe I'm a bit inconsistent or disorganized?
- Disagree on being careless, strongly disagree on getting nervous easily, but strongly agree that I worry a lot. So, I tend to be anxious and worry about things.
- Have an active imagination and original ideas, so I might appreciate creative ads, but I don't have few artistic interests—so maybe I'm somewhat into art or design.

Now, evaluating the ad:

The ad's main selling points are energy and looking good daily. It's a functional drink aimed at improving daily life.

Attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Do I like it? The ad is positive and aspirational, which might resonate with me if it speaks to my needs. Since I worry a lot (strongly agree), maybe the idea of staying energized could be appealing. But since I'm reserved and possibly more thoughtful, I might not immediately "like" the ad unless it's well-crafted.

2. Interesting: The message is clear—energy and appearance. For someone who values looking good and being productive, this could be interesting. But given my personality traits, like being thorough and sometimes careless (disagree), maybe I'm more analytical about such claims.

3. Good: To determine if the ad is good, I'd assess its persuasiveness. Does it provide enough reason to believe? The message is positive but lacks specifics—how does the drink actually help with energy and appearance? If there's no evidence or details, I might not find it convincing.

4. Attractive: Visual appeal matters. If the ad has appealing visuals of people looking vibrant and confident, that could attract me. But if it's too generic, maybe not.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: The drink needs to offer real benefits. Since I'm concerned about my appearance (as per being helpful and unselfish—maybe I care about how I look for others?) but also worry a lot (strongly agree), I might be cautious about such products without proof.

2. Try to buy: If the ad is compelling enough and there's a trial offer, I might consider trying it once or twice.

3. Consider buying: Without strong evidence or a compelling reason, I might not rush to buy but could keep it in mind if others recommend it or if I see more ads reinforcing the benefits.

So, putting it all together, my scores would likely be moderate on attitude because while the ad has positive messages, it lacks depth and specifics that I (as someone thorough) would appreciate. For purchase intention, I'm somewhat interested but not convinced enough to buy immediately.
