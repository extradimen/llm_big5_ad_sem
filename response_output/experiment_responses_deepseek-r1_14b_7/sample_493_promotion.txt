Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break down their background and personality traits.

They're a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, currently a student and divorced, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That’s a pretty high income, so she might be more price-sensitive or looking for premium products.

Personality-wise, she's reserved (strongly agrees), which makes sense why her score was 1 for being outgoing. She is strongly disagreeing with being helpful and unselfish, but that doesn't mean she's unsympathetic—maybe she values her own time more. Trusting is a strong point for her, so credibility in ads matters.

She sometimes feels rude, which might make her cautious about the ad’s approach. Thoroughness is neutral, but she strongly agrees to making plans and following through, indicating she's goal-oriented. She tends to be careless neutrally, gets nervous easily (strongly agree), worries a lot (disagree), emotionally stable (disagree), has an active imagination, and is original with new ideas.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. Given her age, maybe she's looking for something that supports her busy schedule or academic work, perhaps needing to maintain energy levels and looking good.

Considering her reserved nature, the ad needs to be trustworthy without being overly pushy. She trusts ads (strongly agrees), so credibility is key. The message seems clear but might not resonate with her if it's too generic.

Purchase intention: High income might make her willing to spend on a premium product, but she’s cautious about purchases. If the ad clearly communicates benefits and is trustworthy, she might consider it.

For attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: She might not find it very likable because of the reserved nature; perhaps a 3.
2. Interesting: The message is somewhat common, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: It’s good but could be better, so 5.
4. Attractive: Not particularly attractive to her, maybe 3.

Purchase intentions:
1. Intend: Maybe neutral, not sure yet—4.
2. Try: Might not feel compelled to try immediately—4.
3. Consider: Possibly would consider if convinced—5.
