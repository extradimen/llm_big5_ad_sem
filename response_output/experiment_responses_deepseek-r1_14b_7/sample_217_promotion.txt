Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down their profile and personality traits first.

They're a Chinese woman over 60, with a high school education, working in an office, and are divorced. Her monthly income is under 15 million VND, which is about $640 USD, so she's probably on a budget. 

Looking at her personality:
- She's talkative but not outgoing or reserved—so maybe she values social interactions but isn't the life of the party.
- She’s neutral about being helpful and trusting, which might mean she's cautious.
- She strongly agrees to sometimes being rude, so perhaps she's more straightforward or assertive in her communication.
- Disagrees with doing thorough work and not making plans, indicating she might be less organized or detail-oriented.
- Tends to be careless? No, she strongly disagrees, so she's careful. Gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot—maybe she's good at managing stress.
- Emotionally stable and original, but disagrees with having an active imagination and coming up with new ideas, so perhaps more practical.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it targets energy levels and appearance. 

Considering her age, she might be looking for something to help with stamina or looking good as she gets older. Her being emotionally stable could mean she's more grounded in her decisions. But since she doesn't like planning much, maybe ads that are too aspirational don't resonate.

She is talkative but not outgoing, so perhaps the ad's message about social benefits (looking your best) might appeal to her if it aligns with her desire for social interactions without being overwhelming. However, her tendency to be sometimes rude could make her more skeptical of overly cheerful ads.

Her income level suggests she might be price-sensitive, so unless the ad addresses affordability or value for money, it might not push her towards purchase intention. The ad doesn't mention anything about cost, which could be a downside.

She's emotionally stable and practical, so she might look for concrete benefits rather than emotional appeals. The drink being energizing is practical but without specifics (like how it works or ingredients), the ad might feel vague to her.

She finds ads either interesting or not based on relevance. Since the ad focuses on energy and appearance, which are relatable, she might find it somewhat interesting. However, without seeing a clear benefit or trust factor, her belief in the ad's goodness could be neutral.

For purchase intention, her being on a budget and perhaps more cautious about new products might make her less likely to intend to buy immediately. She might consider it if there are future opportunities but not rush into it now.

So, putting it all together:
- Ad attitude: Maybe she doesn't dislike it (so above 1), but finds it somewhat interesting because of the benefits mentioned. Not sure about its overall goodness or attractiveness.
- Purchase intention: Neutral to slightly positive, considering her practical side but budget constraints might hold her back from strong intent.

I think the scores would reflect moderate interest in the ad but without a strong push towards purchase.
