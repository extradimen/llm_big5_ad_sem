Alright, let's break this down. I'm a male over 60 from China with a high school education, currently a student and married, earning more than 46 million VND a month. My personality traits are talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), not reserved (strongly disagree), helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), generally trusting (strongly disagree), not rude (strongly disagree), thorough job (strongly disagree), make plans (disagree), not careless (disagree), get nervous easily (strongly agree), worry a lot (strongly disagree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), active imagination (agree), original and creative (agree), few artistic interests (strongly agree).

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm a student, maybe I relate to needing energy. However, ads that make me feel guilty or pressure me might not be liked. Not sure if it's compelling enough.

2. **Interesting.** It's a common issue but the way it's phrased is a bit generic. Maybe not very engaging without more specific benefits or emotional appeal.

3. **Good.** The ad targets real feelings, which is good. But it lacks depth and specific examples of how the drink helps beyond just looking tired.

4. **Attractive.** I'm emotionally stable but might find this ad too straightforward. It doesn't stand out with creativity or strong imagery.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.** The ad's fear appeal might not resonate as strongly with me, especially since I'm thorough in my decisions and don't make quick purchases. I'd need more information.

2. **Try to buy.** Without a compelling reason or evidence, I'm hesitant. I usually prefer products with proven benefits over emotional appeals.

3. **Consider buying.** There's some relevance because staying alert is important, especially as a student. But I might wait for more info or reviews before considering it seriously.
