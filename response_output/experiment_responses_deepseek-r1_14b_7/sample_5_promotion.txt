Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's think about my demographic profile. I'm from China, female, aged 40-49, have a bachelorâ€™s degree, work as a blue-collar worker, am divorced, and earn less than 15,000,000 VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved (strongly agree), not helpful or unselfish (strongly disagree), trusting (agree), thorough in my work (strongly agree), but I don't make plans well (strongly disagree). I'm also someone who gets nervous easily (strongly agree) and worries a lot (disagree). I am emotionally stable, have an active imagination? Not really (disagree), originality-wise, neutral, and artistic interests are neutral.

Now, looking at the ad: it's promoting a drink that helps stay energized and look good daily. Let's see how this resonates with me.

1. **I like the ad.** - Hmm, I'm reserved and not very outgoing. The ad seems targeted towards someone who wants to be energetic and look their best, which might appeal more to younger people or those in higher social circles. Since I'm a bit older and maybe less concerned about looking my best every day, this doesn't speak directly to me. So, I'd probably give it a lower score here, maybe around 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Interesting? Well, energy drinks are common, but the part about looking your best might not interest me as much. It feels a bit superficial, and given that I'm more reserved, I don't find it particularly engaging. Maybe a 3 here too.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - To assess if the ad is good, I consider credibility. The claims are about staying energized and looking good, which are positive but somewhat generic. I get nervous easily, so maybe I'm skeptical of such broad claims without evidence. A 4 might be fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Attractiveness depends on how well it resonates. Since it's more about energy and appearance, which aren't top priorities for me, I'd say it's not very attractive to me. Maybe a 2 or 3 here. Let's go with 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Intending to buy? Not really, because the ad doesn't speak to my needs. I'm more focused on practicality and maybe health over appearance. So, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Trying it might be if there's a promotion or discount, but generally, no strong intention. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering? I'm on the fence, but it doesn't seem essential. A 3 here as well.

So, putting it all together, my scores would be:

Ad attitude: [3, 3, 4, 3]

Purchase intention: [2, 3, 3]
