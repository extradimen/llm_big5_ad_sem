Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** Since I'm reserved and sometimes rude, ads that are too bubbly might not resonate. But this one's about energy and looking good, which could appeal to my desire for self-improvement. However, being talkative but reserved makes me cautious, so I'd give a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The promise of energy and looking best sounds appealing. It's relatable, especially with busy student life. But since I'm not very outgoing, maybe it doesn't hit home as much. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Credibility is key. The claims are broad, so without specific evidence, it's hard to fully trust. My skeptical side gives a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Visual appeal matters. If the ad has vibrant visuals and catchy music, it could be eye-catching. But as someone who's not into flashy stuff, I'd give it a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** With my tight budget and focus on essentials, it's unlikely I'll splurge on this unless there's a strong reason. So, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Maybe if it's discounted or recommended by friends. But generally, not a priority. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's possible if I'm in the market for something similar. A 3 feels right because it's on my radar but not top of mind.
