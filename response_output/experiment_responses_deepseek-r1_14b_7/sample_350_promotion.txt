Alright, I'm a student from China, female, under 20, with a monthly income of between 16 to 25 million VND. I'm outgoing but also reserved, helpful sometimes, and trusting. However, I can be rude at times, careless, and not very thorough or good at making plans. I get nervous easily, worry a bit, and my emotional stability is questionable. I have an active imagination but originality isn't my strong suit, and I don't have much interest in the arts.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. Since I'm a student, maybe I need energy to stay alert. But I also care about looking good, which is part of socializing since I'm outgoing.

But wait, the drink claims to help me look my best. Does that mean it's for skincare or general appearance? Maybe it's a functional drink with added vitamins or something. However, as someone who tends to be careless and sometimes rude, maybe the ad doesn't resonate because I don't prioritize looking my best every day.

I'm also not very thorough, so I might not pay attention to ads that make grandiose claims without specifics. The ad is positive but lacks details about what makes the drink effective. Plus, with an active imagination and being original, I might question if this drink is unique or just another product in a crowded market.

Considering my income level, 16-25 million VND is around $700-$1000 USD, which isn't too bad for a student, but I probably don't have a lot of disposable income. The price point might be an issue if the drink is expensive. Also, as someone who sometimes worries and gets nervous, maybe I'm more cautious about health products.

On the other hand, being outgoing and helpful, I value social interactions and appearances. If this drink helps me stay energized, it could help with my studies or extracurricular activities, making me a better student and more presentable in social settings.

But I'm not sure if I believe the ad completely. It feels a bit too perfect without evidence. I would need to see more about the product's benefits or maybe some reviews before considering purchasing it.

So, for the ad attitude scores: I don't dislike it, but it doesn't excite me either. Maybe around 3-4 on each scale. For purchase intention, since I'm not convinced and have other priorities, my intentions are lowâ€”maybe 2s across the board.
