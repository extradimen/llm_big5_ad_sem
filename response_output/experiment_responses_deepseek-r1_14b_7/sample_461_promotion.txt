Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it's for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. That sounds like it's targeting people who are busy and maybe looking to improve their appearance or energy levels.

Now, considering my background—I'm from China, male, in my 20s, have a bachelor's degree, work as a blue-collar worker, married, with a monthly income over 46 million VND. My personality traits show that I'm talkative and outgoing but also reserved. I tend to be helpful and unselfish? Not really—disagree there. Trusting? Also disagree. Sometimes rude? No, strongly disagree. Thorough job? Agree. Make plans and follow through? Strongly disagree. Careless? Agree. Get nervous easily? Disagree. Worry a lot? Neutral. Emotionally stable? Neutral. Active imagination? Disagree. Original ideas? Strongly disagree. Artistic interests? Neutral.

So, looking at the ad: it's promoting energy and appearance. My job as a blue-collar worker might be physically demanding, so staying energized could be appealing. But I'm not sure how much I care about looking my best every day—maybe more for social situations or work appearances, but since I'm married, perhaps family life is a priority too.

The ad's message is positive and focuses on daily benefits, which might resonate with someone who values their appearance and energy. However, given that I'm somewhat disagreeable in terms of being helpful and trusting, maybe the ad feels a bit manipulative or overpromising.

Let me break down each attitude question:

1. I like the ad: Hmm, the message is positive but maybe too generic. I might not feel strongly connected to it. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's an energy drink with beauty benefits—could be interesting if targeted well. Maybe 4?
3. Good: Overall, does it convey value? Maybe 5.
4. Attractive: The visuals and message could be appealing, so maybe higher than the others—perhaps 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Not sure I'm convinced enough. Maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: If it's available, might give it a shot. So, 4?
3. Consider buying: Possibly, but not sure yet. Maybe 5?

Wait, let me think again. Since I'm talkative and outgoing, maybe the ad appeals more to my social side. But being reserved, perhaps I don't need others to notice as much. Also, since I'm a blue-collar worker, practicality might matter—does this drink fit into my budget? At 46 million VND monthly, probably not an issue, but maybe it's expensive for a drink.

I worry about the ad being too focused on looks and energy, which might not fully align with my priorities as a married man. Plus, I'm not very trusting of ads—maybe I'd need more proof before believing it. So perhaps my scores should reflect some interest but not strong intention.

Maybe adjust the attitude scores to 4,5,6,6 and purchase intentions at 3,4,5. Or maybe a bit lower for purchase because of the trust issues.
