Alright, let's break down my evaluation of this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad: 

1. **I like the ad**: I'm a 20-something civil servant in China, so staying energized is important for my job. Plus, looking good is something everyone cares about. The message seems positive and relatable. But I'm not sure if it's targeted well enough for me specifically. Maybe it's too generic? So on the scale of 1 to 7, I'd give it a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The ad focuses on energy and appearance, which are common needs but maybe not unique selling points. It doesn't stand out much because other drinks make similar claims. I don't feel particularly engaged by it, so another 5 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The benefits mentioned are clear, but I'm skeptical about how effective a drink can be in delivering both energy and improving appearance. There's no evidence or specifics provided, which makes me question its credibility. On this point, I'd score it a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Visually, if the ad is well-made with appealing images, it could attract attention. But since I'm more focused on substance than style, and without knowing the visuals, I'll give it a neutral 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My monthly income is quite high, so affordability isn't an issue. However, my tendency to worry a lot makes me cautious about trying new products without proven benefits. Plus, I'm not particularly thirsty for new drink options right now. So, a 3 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Trying it might be interesting, but since I'm careful and tend to make thorough plans, I wouldn't rush into buying something just because of an ad. Maybe if there were more info or reviews, but not based on the ad alone. Another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: There's a possibility that the drink could fit my needs for energy and looking good. It's something I might think about, especially if it's marketed well elsewhere. So, a 4 here as I'm somewhat open to considering it but not fully convinced yet.
