Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at their demographic profile: they're a male civil servant in China between 20-29 with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, and earns around 36-45 million VND per month. That's a decent income, so perhaps they can afford such products. Being a civil servant might mean a stable job, which could influence their spending habits.

Now, the personality traits:

1. Talkative: Strongly Agree
2. Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree
3. Reserved: Disagree (so not reserved)
4. Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
5. Generally trusting: Strongly Agree
6. Sometimes rude: Disagree
7. Thorough job: Strongly Agree
8. Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree
9. Careless: Strongly Agree
10. Gets nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
11. Worry a lot: Neutral
12. Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
13. Active imagination: Strongly Agree
14. Original and new ideas: Strongly Disagree
15. Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So, this person is talkative, outgoing, trusting, thorough in their work but careless, not careful with details maybe? They don't make plans well but follow through? Hmm, a bit contradictory.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. Since the person is outgoing and sociable, they probably value looking good in social situations. Being talkative, maybe they're in environments where their appearance matters, like work or social events.

The ad seems to play on fear of feeling tired and looking dull. If someone is concerned about their image and energy levels, this might appeal to them. However, the person has a tendency to be careless (strongly agree) which might mean they don't take such ads too seriously. They might think, "I'm already handling my job well; maybe I don't need this drink."

But wait, they also have a strong imagination and are original in some aspects but disagree with coming up with new ideas. Hmm, not sure how that ties in. Maybe their active imagination could make them curious about products that promise to enhance their state.

Purchase intention: Would they intend to buy? They might be skeptical because of the careless trait, but also interested due to being outgoing and trusting. The ad is trying to prevent tiredness, which is a real concern for someone social.

So, for attitude towards the ad:

1. Like it: Since they're outgoing, maybe they find it interesting (agree) but not sure about liking it. Maybe neutral.
2. Interesting: Given their active imagination and being talkative, probably agree.
3. Good: If the message is clear and relevant, might agree.
4. Attractive: The ad's message is direct; if they find it persuasive, maybe agree.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Maybe neutral because of the careless trait but possible interest.
2. Try to buy: Might be a bit more positive here.
3. Consider buying: Likely higher as the product addresses their needs in social settings.

Wait, but considering their thoroughness at work and tendency to follow through with plans (they disagree), maybe they're not the type to make impulse purchases. They might need more convincing.

So overall, I think their scores would be moderate. They find the ad interesting and good, but not extremely so. Their consideration for purchase is there, but intent isn't strong due to being careless or perhaps skepticism.
