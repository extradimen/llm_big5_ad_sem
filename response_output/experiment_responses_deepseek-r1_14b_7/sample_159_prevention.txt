Alright, so I need to figure out how this person would score their attitude towards the ad and their purchase intention based on the given demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key message here is about feeling energized and looking good, which seems to target personal appearance and energy levels.

The person in question is a Chinese woman over 60 with a bachelorâ€™s degree, working as a blue-collar worker, divorced, and earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits include being outgoing but also reserved, generally trusting but sometimes careless, emotionally stable yet prone to nervousness and worry, thorough in her work, creative and original, with neutral artistic interests.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - Considering she is talkative (disagree) but outgoing (agree), maybe she doesn't find the need for social interaction as much since she's already outgoing. The ad talks about looking dull, which might not resonate with her if she's more reserved. So maybe a 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas (strongly agree). However, ads targeting tiredness and appearance might be too generic. Maybe a middle score like 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - The message is clear but may not be compelling enough given her personality traits. Trusting but also sometimes careless, maybe she doesn't find it trustworthy or impactful. Perhaps a 3.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - She has artistic interests as neutral and might not find the ad visually appealing if it's too simple. Maybe a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - At over 60, maybe she's more cautious about new products. Her income is decent but being a blue-collar worker, perhaps she prioritizes essentials. So low intent, like a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Without strong motivation from the ad, she might not feel compelled to try it. Maybe a 3 again.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It's possible she'll think about it but isn't sure yet. So a slightly higher score than intent and trying, maybe a 4.

Putting it all together, her scores would reflect moderate interest in the ad but low intention to buy.
