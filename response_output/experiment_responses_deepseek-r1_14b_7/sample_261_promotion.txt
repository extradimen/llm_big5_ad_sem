Alright, let me break down how I came up with these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The ad is quite generic and doesn't really resonate with my personality traits. While it's positive, it doesn't highlight anything that speaks to me personally, so I'm not too keen on it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   It's straightforward but lacks depth or a unique angle that would make it stand out. Without any emotional appeal or personal connection, it doesn't hold my interest much.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   The message is clear about staying energized and looking good, which are positive points. However, without specific benefits or evidence, I'm not fully convinced of its effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Visually, it might be appealing, but the content doesn't entice me to pay attention for long. It's too vague and doesn't connect with my values or lifestyle.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   The ad doesn't provide enough reason for me to feel compelled to buy it. I'm not convinced it offers anything unique or necessary in my life right now.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Without any compelling reasons or persuasive evidence, there's no strong motivation to seek out the product.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   While I recognize staying energized and looking good are important, the ad doesn't offer enough information or incentives to make me seriously consider purchasing it.
