Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

The person is from China, male, aged between 50-59, with a postgraduate degree. He's divorced, earns around 16-25 million VND monthly, which is a decent income but not extremely high for someone with his education. His occupation is listed as 'Other,' so maybe he runs his own business or something else.

Looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing and Sociable: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and Unselfish: Agree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes Rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough Job: Agree
- Makes Plans and Follows Through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Nervous Easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a Lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active Imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, New Ideas: Strongly Agree
- Artistic Interests: Disagree

So he's reserved but talkative? That seems contradictory. Maybe he's selective in who he talks to. He's helpful and unselfish but not trusting, which might mean he's cautious about whom he helps. He tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, isn't emotionally stable but has an active imagination and is original.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who are concerned about their energy levels and appearances.

Considering his personality, he might worry about looking good and being energetic because of the 'worry a lot' trait. But since he's reserved, maybe the ad doesn't appeal to him in terms of socializing or outgoingness. He's original and has an active imagination but doesn't have much artistic interest, so the ad might not connect with that side.

He's thorough in his work but sometimes careless, which could affect how he perceives ads. Since he worries a lot, maybe the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates because it taps into his anxiety about appearances. However, since he strongly disagrees with being trusting, he might be skeptical of the ad's claims.

His income is decent, so he can afford such products, but his carefulness and tendency to worry might make him more cautious in purchasing decisions. He might want evidence or reviews before trying something new.

Putting it all together, I think the ad might have some appeal because it addresses his concerns about looking good and feeling tired, but his skepticism and reserved nature might make him not fully engage with the ad. His tendency to be careless could mean he doesn't prioritize such products highly. So, he might not feel a strong intention to buy but could consider it if convinced by other factors.

So for the ad attitude, maybe a middle score because it somewhat addresses his concerns but doesn't strongly resonate. For purchase intention, he's more on the fence.
