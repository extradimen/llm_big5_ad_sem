Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a 50-59-year-old Chinese woman living with my parents, working as an office worker with a monthly income between 26,000,000 and 35,000,000 VND. I have a bachelor's degree.

Looking at the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, my personality traits might influence how I perceive this ad. I'm talkative and outgoing, but also reserved and helpful. However, I generally don't trust people much, so ads need to be trustworthy for me to believe them. I tend not to be rude, which makes me a considerate consumer. I'm thorough in my work but not great at sticking to plansâ€”I sometimes get careless. I don't get nervous easily but worry a lot and am emotionally stable with an active imagination.

The ad's main claims are about energy and looking good daily. As someone who values looking her best, this might resonate, especially the part about staying energized, which could be appealing for maintaining work performance and personal life. However, I'm cautious about ads, so I need to trust that the product actually works as advertised.

Considering my income level, I can afford premium products, but I might also look for value and effectiveness. The ad doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence, which makes me skeptical. Without clear proof, it's hard for me to believe the claims fully.

I'm emotionally stable but worry a lot, so ads that make exaggerated promises could stress me out if they don't deliver. My active imagination means I can picture the benefits but also imagine potential downsides without more information.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: It's not uninteresting or bad, but it doesn't strongly connect with me. The message is somewhat appealing but lacks depth. For purchase intention, while I might consider it because it addresses energy and appearance, my skepticism makes me hesitant to intend or try buying immediately. Considering it as a possibility, though.

So, scoring-wise: Like (4), Interesting (5), Good (4), Attractive (4) for attitude; Intent (3), Try (3), Consider (5).
