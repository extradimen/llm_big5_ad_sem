Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic profile and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my background. I'm from China, male, in my 20s-30s with a postgraduate degree, married, and earn about 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, not trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous, worries a lot but is emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original with new ideas, and few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad. - Hmm, the ad emphasizes energy and looking good. Since I'm outgoing (strongly agree) and helpful, maybe this drink could help me maintain the energy needed for social interactions and being active. But I'm not sure if it's directly appealing to me since I don't have high artistic interests or imagination. Maybe neutral.

2. I think the ad is interesting. - The message is clear about benefits. Being original (agree), I might find it somewhat interesting but not extremely so. So maybe 3.

3. I believe the ad is good. - For belief, credibility matters. I generally distrust people (strongly disagree). If the ad doesn't show evidence or trustworthiness, my belief would be low. Maybe a 2.

4. I find the ad attractive. - Being emotionally stable and not easily nervous, but sometimes careless (agree), maybe the ad is somewhat appealing visually. But without seeing it, hard to say. Neutral at 3.

Now purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The benefits are tempting, but I'm cautious about products. Since I worry a lot and distrust, maybe I won't intend to buy immediately. So 2.

2. Try to buy: Maybe if others recommend it or if I see evidence, I might consider trying once. Perhaps a 3.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar but not a priority. Maybe a 4.

Wait, let me reconsider. Being outgoing and needing energy could make the drink appealing. But my distrust makes me skeptical of such claims without proof. So maybe lower scores. Let me adjust:

Ad attitude: I might actually find it somewhat interesting (3), believe it's good but not sure (maybe 2), like it a bit (3), and find it attractive if visuals are good, so 4.

Purchase intention: If I'm considering looking best and energetic, maybe more towards higher scores. Intend could be 5, try as 6, consider at 5? Wait, but earlier thought was lower. Hmm, conflicting. Since the ad targets my outgoing nature but I'm distrustful, perhaps:

Ad attitude: [3,4,2,3]
Purchase intention: [5,6,5]

Wait, no. Let me think again.

For ad态度:
1. Like it: Maybe 4 because it's relevant to my lifestyle.
2. Interesting: 4 as the message is clear and appealing for someone like me.
3. Believe: 2 due to distrust.
4. Attractive: 5 if visuals are good, but without knowing, maybe 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Maybe 6 because it aligns with my needs.
2. Try: 7, as I might seek alternatives.
3. Consider: 5, but not a priority yet.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it:

Ad态度:
- Like (3)
- Interesting (4)
- Believe (2)
- Attractive (3)

Purchase intention:
- Intend (4)
- Try (5)
- Consider (6)

No, maybe higher for purchase if the benefits are strong.

Alternatively, considering I'm careful and distrusting but value looking good:

Ad态度: [4,4,3,4]
Purchase intention: [5,5,5]

I think this makes more sense because despite being cautious, the benefits appeal to me.
