Alright, let's break this down. I need to evaluate how someone with my demographic and personality traits would respond to the advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

First, considering my personality: I'm talkative but not outgoing. That might mean I prefer interactions that are meaningful rather than socializing for the sake of it. Being reserved could make me more introspective about ads.

I'm helpful but somewhat unselfish—though I disagree with being helpful, so maybe I'm more self-focused. Trusting others is a no-go; that makes me cautious towards pitches. I get nervous easily and worry a lot, which might make me skeptical of such ads. However, I'm thorough in my work, planful, and not careless, suggesting I evaluate things methodically.

Looking at the ad's message: feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. This targets self-image concerns—appealing to someone who wants to maintain energy and appearance. But as someone who is more reserved and possibly cautious, would this resonate?

I'm emotionally stable but get nervous easily, so maybe the fear of looking bad could play into that anxiety. On the other hand, my thoroughness might make me question if such a drink is necessary or just a quick fix.

Purchase intention-wise: I'm not someone who's easily swayed by ads, especially ones that feel manipulative. The ad seems to create a problem (feeling tired and dull) without providing clear evidence of its solution. My skepticism would kick in, making me less likely to trust the product.

Considering my monthly income is 26-35 million VND, I have some disposable income but might be cautious about spending on something that's not proven to me as essential or effective.

So, for the ad attitude: It's probably neutral at best. The message isn't tailored to someone reserved and cautious. For purchase intention, low scores because the ad doesn't address my needs effectively, and I'm not convinced.
