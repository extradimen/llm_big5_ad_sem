Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My job is to evaluate how I as a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree in civil service would respond to this ad, considering my personality traits. 

Starting with my attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** – The key points here are "energized" and "look your best." As someone who's outgoing (Strongly Agree) but also tends to be careless (Strongly Agree), I might appreciate something that boosts energy because it aligns with my social lifestyle. However, being a civil servant, maybe looking good is important for professional appearances. But wait, the ad seems a bit too general. It doesn't specify how exactly it helps you look your best. Also, considering I'm reserved (Neutral), I might not be as interested in products focused on appearance. So, my initial thought is that I don't dislike it but also don't feel strongly positive towards it. Maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – Interestingness depends on how unique or compelling the message is. Since I have an active imagination (Neutral) and come up with new ideas (Strongly Agree), maybe this ad doesn't stand out enough. It's a common claim for energy drinks, so it might not capture my interest much. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** – Believing in the ad relates to trust and credibility. I'm generally trusting (Neutral) but sometimes rude (Neutral). The ad makes bold claims without evidence, which could make me skeptical. Maybe a 4 because it's not bad, but I don't see strong reasons to fully trust it.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** – Attractiveness might relate to how visually appealing or engaging the ad is. Since I'm emotionally stable (Disagree) and get nervous easily (Disagree), maybe I don't find it particularly吸引人. Alternatively, since it's about looking good and energy, which are positive attributes, I might give it a 5.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – Intention to buy depends on how much the ad resonates with me. The ad targets energy and appearance, which could be relevant, but without specific benefits or evidence, I'm not convinced. Plus, as someone who tends to be careless (Strongly Agree), maybe I don't prioritize such products. So a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** – Trying it might depend on how much the ad makes me curious. Since it's about looking good and energy, which are important in social settings, but without more info, I'm not sure. Maybe a 4 because I'm somewhat interested but not enough to actively seek it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** – Considering implies that it's on my radar. Since the ad touches on points that could be relevant for someone in my demographic and personality, maybe I would think about it when making purchasing decisions. So a 5.

Wait, but let me double-check:

For attitude:
- Like: Maybe higher because looking good is a positive thing.
- Interesting: Not sure if it's unique enough.
- Good: Neutral belief because of lack of evidence.
- Attractive: Possibly neutral to slightly positive.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: Probably low because I'm not convinced by the ad alone.
- Try: Also low for the same reasons.
- Consider: Maybe moderate, as it could be something that comes up in shopping decisions.

Hmm, perhaps my initial scores were a bit off. Let me adjust:

Ad attitude scores might be 4, 3, 4, 5 or similar.

Purchase intention might be lower than I initially thought because the ad isn't compelling enough with the given information.
