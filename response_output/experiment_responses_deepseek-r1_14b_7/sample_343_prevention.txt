Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's a common concern, especially in busy lifestyles. I don't particularly dislike it, but I'm not overly enthusiastic either. So, a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is straightforward but not particularly innovative. It doesn't stand out or capture my interest much. Hence, a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While it's clear and addresses a real issue, it lacks creativity and depth. I don't find it compelling enough to strongly agree, so another 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals might be appealing, but the message isn't strong enough for me to find it very attractive. A 5 seems fair here.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: I don't feel a strong personal need for such a drink. My current routine works fine without it. So, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: There's no immediate incentive for me to switch my habits. Maybe if there were a promotion, but as is, a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's not something I'm dismissing outright, so consideration is possible under certain circumstances. A 4 seems reasonable.
