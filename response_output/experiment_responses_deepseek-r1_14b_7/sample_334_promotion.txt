Okay, let me break down my thought process for evaluating this advertisement. First, I'm a Chinese male under 20 with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income of around 26-35 million VND. My personality traits include being helpful, trusting, sometimes careless, having an active imagination, and original with ideas.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad: The message is positive, targeting energy and appearance, which are appealing. However, being reserved and sometimes careless, maybe I'm not strongly drawn to it. So a 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim but presented well. Maybe a 4.
3. Good: Effective in conveying benefits, so 5.
4. Attractive: The visuals might be good, but my reserved nature keeps me neutral at 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: As someone who worries about appearance and is helpful, maybe I would consider it. A 5.
2. Try to buy: Given the claims match some of my traits (energized and looking best), a 4.
3. Consider buying: It's a consideration but not definite yet, so another 5.

Overall, I'm moderately interested but not highly compelled due to personality traits like being reserved and sometimes careless.
