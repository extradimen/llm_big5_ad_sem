Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My job is to rate how much I like the ad on four aspects (like, interesting, good, attractive) and then assess my purchase intentions on three points (intend, try, consider). Each of these will be scored from 1 to 7.

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a male in my late 30s living in China, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My income is around 26-35 million VND per month, which is quite high for a blue-collar job, so maybe I have some disposable income. I'm divorced, which might mean I value social interactions or perhaps have different priorities in life.

Personality traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree) and outgoing (agree), but also reserved (strongly agree). That seems contradictory at first glance, but perhaps it means I'm selective about who I interact with. I consider myself helpful and unselfish, which could make me more responsive to ads that emphasize benefits for others or society. However, I generally distrust people (disagree on trusting), so I might be skeptical of the ad's claims.

I don't tend to be rude (strongly disagree) but am not thorough in my work (disagree). My plans are followed neutrally, and I'm neither particularly careful nor careless. I don't get nervous easily, which is good for dealing with ads. Worrying a lot is neutral, and emotional stability is something I lack (disagree), so maybe I'm more impulsive or moody. I have an active imagination but don't strongly identify as original or artistic.

Now, the ad itself: It's promoting a drink that claims to keep you energized and help you look your best daily. The key benefits here are energy and appearance. Given my personality, being talkative and outgoing might make me more concerned about looking good in social settings. However, since I'm reserved, maybe I don't feel the need for constant social energy.

Looking at my skepticism (disagree on trusting), I might question whether this drink can genuinely deliver both energy and improved appearance without any side effects or over-promising. The ad seems a bit too perfect, which could make me distrustful.

I'm helpful and unselfish, so if the product also had公益 aspects (like supporting others), it might appeal to me more. But the ad doesn't mention that, so it's just about personal benefits.

My tendency to be careless is neutral, but since I don't do thorough jobs, maybe I wouldn't research the product deeply before trying it, which could affect my trust in its claims.

Regarding purchase intention: My income is high, so affordability isn't an issue. But without a strong belief in the product's effectiveness, I might not be motivated to buy it immediately. Trying the product once could be possible if it's easily accessible, but considering buying it regularly would depend on how effective it is perceived to be.

So, for ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Given my mixed feelings about trust and the conflicting traits, maybe a middle score like 3.
2. Interesting: The idea of a drink that offers both energy and appearance benefits could be interesting, so perhaps a 4.
3. Good: Not sure if it's good because of skepticism, maybe 3.
4. Attractive: The ad seems well-made but the claims are too broad, so I'd give it a 3.

Purchase intentions:
1. Intend: Probably low, since trust is an issue. Maybe a 2.
2. Try: Higher than intent, perhaps a 4 if it's easily available.
3. Consider: Neutral, maybe a 3 or 4, but leaning towards considering it as a possibility.

I think my scores might be a bit on the lower side because of distrust and the ad's broad claims without supporting evidence. However, being talkative and outgoing, I might find some value in appearing better for social interactions, so there's a slight pull towards interest.
