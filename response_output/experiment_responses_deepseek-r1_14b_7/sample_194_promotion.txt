Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40-49 year old Chinese woman living with her parents, working as a civil servant with a monthly income under 15 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative and outgoing, helpful but not overly trusting, not very thorough in my work, and somewhat careless.

The ad claims the drink helps stay energized and look your best daily. Let me break down how I might respond to this.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** The drink's benefits are appealing, but since I don't feel tired often and am cautious about products, my interest is neutral. Maybe a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** It targets energy and appearance, which are relevant to many people, so perhaps a 4.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** The claims seem too broad without specific evidence. I might give it a 3.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** Visual appeal could make it more engaging, but as text-only info, maybe a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Without seeing results or trust in the brand, my intent is lowâ€”maybe a 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's some interest, so perhaps a 3.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on the fence, but I might think about it more, so maybe a 4.

Overall, my scores would reflect moderate interest but cautiousness towards purchasing without more evidence or personal need.
