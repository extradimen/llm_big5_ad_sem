Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the advertisement claims that the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. As a high school student in China who is married and has a monthly income under 15 million VND, I'm looking for something affordable and effective. The ad seems to target energy and appearance, which are relevant to students balancing studies and social life.

Looking at my personality traits: I strongly agree that I am outgoing, trusting, and thorough but also get nervous easily and tend to be careless. This makes me cautious about ads promising too much because I worry about the product's credibility. My tendency to make plans but sometimes be rude might mean I'm more focused on functionality rather than image.

For the ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad**: The message is positive, but without specific details or evidence, it feels a bit generic. So, maybe a 4.
2. **Interesting**: It's a common claim, so not particularly interesting. Maybe a 3.
3. **Good**: The concept is good, but lacking depth makes me give it a 4.
4. **Attractive**: Visual appeal isn't mentioned, so I'm neutral with a 4.

Purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: Without trust in the brand or proof of effectiveness, I'm hesitant. So, a 3.
2. **Try to buy**: There's some interest due to the benefits, but hesitation remains. Maybe a 5.
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar, so a 4.

I balanced between being interested in the product's claims and skepticism about the ad's credibility, especially given my cautious nature and tendency towards thoroughness without overcommitment.
