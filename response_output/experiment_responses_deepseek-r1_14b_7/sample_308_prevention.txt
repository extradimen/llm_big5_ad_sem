Alright, let me break down how I arrived at each score for both the ad attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the ad态度 (attitude toward the advertisement):

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. While the message is clear about the product's benefits, my personality traits suggest I'm reserved and sometimes rude, but more importantly, I worry a lot and get nervous easily. This ad might not resonate with me because it doesn't address emotional or psychological aspects beyond physical appearance. So, I'd give it a 2.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept of feeling tired is relatable, especially for someone in their 50s who might be dealing with stress from work or family. However, since the ad doesn't tap into deeper emotional needs or original ideas, I'm only mildly interested. A score of 3 seems appropriate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The message is straightforward but lacks depth. It doesn't connect on a personal level beyond surface-level issues. My tendency to be critical and not easily persuaded makes me doubt the ad's effectiveness. A 4 reflects that I don't strongly believe in its quality.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: While the ad has a clear message, it doesn't stand out creatively or emotionally. Given my reserved nature and focus on practicality over aesthetics, the ad isn't particularly吸引人 (attractive). So, another 3 here.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The ad's appeal is low for me due to my skepticism towards such messages. Plus, I'm not easily swayed by ads that don't address deeper concerns. A 2 reflects that I have little intention to buy based on this ad.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without a strong emotional or personal connection, the motivation to try the product is minimal. My cautious nature and tendency to worry about purchases make me hesitant. Another 2 here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While not strongly considering it, I'm not completely dismissing it either. There's a slight chance if the product aligns with my needs beyond what the ad presents. A 4 captures that middle ground where consideration is possible but not certain.
