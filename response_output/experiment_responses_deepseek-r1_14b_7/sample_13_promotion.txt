Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a female office worker in China who's divorced and earns between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. I'm outgoing and talkative, but not very helpful or unselfish. I trust people easily but sometimes come off as rude. I don't plan much and tend to be careless, which makes me get nervous easily.

The advertisement says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Hmm, the ad sounds positive and appealing because it highlights energy and looking good. I'm outgoing, so things that make me feel good might resonate. But being talkative doesn't necessarily mean I'll like it; maybe not a 7. Maybe around 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The promise of energy and looking good could be interesting, especially since I'm in my high school education level but still working. It might catch my attention. Maybe a 6.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Do I trust it? Since I tend to trust people (strongly agree), but I also sometimes find ads manipulative. Not sure, maybe a middle score like 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Being outgoing and talkative might make me more attracted to such messages. But I'm not sure if it's visually appealing or just the message. Maybe a 6.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Not really, because my personality is careless and I don't plan much. Plus, high price might be an issue despite my income being decent. Maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Similar reasoning as above, maybe a 5? There's some interest but not enough to make me rush.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering yes, because it's about energy and looking good, which are important. Maybe a 6?

Wait, I think I might have overthought some scores. Let me adjust:

For ad attitude:
- Like: 5
- Interesting: 5
- Good: 4
- Attractive: 5

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 3
- Try: 3
- Consider: 5

But wait, I'm not sure about the consideration. Maybe if it's affordable and fits my routine, I might consider more. So perhaps higher than 5?

Alternatively:

Ad attitude scores: [5,6,4,6]

Purchase intention scores: [3,4,5]

I think that makes sense considering my personality traits.
