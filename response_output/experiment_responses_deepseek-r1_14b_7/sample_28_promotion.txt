Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target audience seems to be people who value energy and appearance. 

The person in question is from China, male, over 60 years old, has a high school education, is married, earns more than 46 million VND monthly, and is a student. His personality traits are talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), not reserved (strongly disagree), helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), generally trusting (strongly disagree), not rude (strongly disagree), does thorough jobs (strongly disagree), doesn't make plans well (disagree), isn't careless (disagree), gets nervous easily (strongly agree), doesn't worry much (strongly disagree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), has an active imagination (agree), original and creative (agree), but has few artistic interests (strongly agree).

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
   - I like the ad. 
     The person is talkative and outgoing, so he might appreciate a product that helps him stay energized to engage with others. However, he's also over 60 and has artistic interests as "few," which might make him less interested in appearance-focused ads. His personality traits don't strongly align with being image-conscious, so maybe not too high on liking the ad.
   - I think the ad is interesting.
     The person is talkative and outgoing, but his focus might be more on functionality than appearance. The message about looking good could be less appealing to him. Maybe around a 3 or 4.
   - I believe the ad is good.
     He's helpful and unselfish, so he might value products that improve well-being for others. But he's not trusting of ads (strongly disagrees), so his belief in the ad's goodness could be low. Perhaps a 3.
   - I find the ad attractive.
     Since he doesn't have strong artistic interests and is more reserved in some traits, the ad might not be very attractive to him. Maybe around 2-3.

2. **Purchase intention:**
   - I intend to purchase this product.
     He's a student on a high income, which seems contradictory. Maybe his primary focus isn't on luxury or image products. His monthly income is high, but perhaps he's more interested in practical items. So low intent, maybe 1.
   - I will try to buy this product.
     Even if the ad doesn't strongly appeal, sometimes people try new things. But given his skepticism towards ads, maybe a 2.
   - I will consider buying this product.
     He might not give it much thought since the benefits don't align with his priorities. Maybe around 1.

So putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 3, 3, 2]
Purchase intention scores: [1, 2, 1]

But wait, let me think again. He's over 60 and a student, so maybe he's more health-conscious, which the energizing aspect could appeal to. That might increase his liking of the ad. So maybe adjust the first score up.

Ad attitude scores: [4, 3, 3, 2]
Purchase intention remains low because of skepticism towards ads.
