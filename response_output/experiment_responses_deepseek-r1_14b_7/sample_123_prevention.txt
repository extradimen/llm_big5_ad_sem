Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their background and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience seems to be people who are concerned about staying alert and looking good. 

Looking at the demographic profile:
- Gender: Male
- Age: <20 (so probably a student)
- Education: Postgraduate degree (maybe an MBA or something else, but still a student)
- Monthly income: 36–45 million VND, which is quite high for a student in Vietnam. Maybe he has some family support or part-time work.
- Marital status: Married, so maybe has responsibilities beyond just himself.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Neutral
- Sometimes rude: Agree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Agree
- Worries a lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Artistic interests: Strongly Agree

So this person is outgoing but not talkative. He's helpful and unselfish? No, he tends to disagree with that. So maybe more self-centered. He's sometimes rude, which might make him come off as confident or dismissive. He does thorough work neutrally, so neither here nor there. He makes plans but doesn't always follow through. Careless a lot, so not detail-oriented. Gets nervous and worries a lot—so anxiety-prone. Not emotionally stable. Doesn't have an active imagination but is original and comes up with new ideas, which is interesting.

Now, the ad's message: Without this drink, you'll feel tired and look dull. So it's targeting people who care about their appearance and energy levels, perhaps to stay alert in social or professional settings. 

How would this person react? He's outgoing but sometimes rude—maybe he values looking good to make a good impression. However, being careless and not too thorough might make him not pay attention to ads that are too pushy. The ad seems to play on fears of tiredness and looking bad, which could resonate with someone who is concerned about their image.

But considering his traits:
- He's outgoing, so maybe he cares about how others perceive him.
- But he's careless, so perhaps he wouldn't be swayed easily by such ads unless the message strongly resonates.
- Worrying a lot and getting nervous—maybe he's looking for solutions to manage stress or anxiety.

The ad is trying to prevent tiredness and dull looks. So it's a prevention-focused message, which might align with someone who wants to avoid negative outcomes.

Now, evaluating his attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad.
   - He might not particularly like ads that are too pushy or fear-based, especially if he's careless and maybe feels they're manipulative. So probably a low score here.
2. Interesting.
   - It touches on social image and energy, which could be interesting to an outgoing person. Maybe neutral to slightly positive.
3. Good.
   - Whether the ad is good depends on if he finds it convincing. Given his tendency to worry, maybe it's somewhat effective but not excellent.
4. Attractive.
   - If the ad is visually appealing and makes a strong point, maybe it's attractive. But again, he might find it a bit over the top.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He's careless and might not be convinced easily unless the product seems necessary.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if the message resonates with his need to look good and stay alert.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, as he is original and might consider new ideas, but his carelessness could make him procrastinate.

So putting it all together, he's somewhat on the fence about the ad. It doesn't strongly appeal to him because of his personality traits like being careless and sometimes rude, which might make him more skeptical or less likely to be swayed by such messages. But since he is outgoing and values social image, there's a chance he might consider it.

Therefore, I think his scores would be low for liking the ad but slightly higher for interest and attractiveness, with consideration towards purchase intention but not a strong intent.
