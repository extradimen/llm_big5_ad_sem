Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, looking at the ad: it claims the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. 

Starting with my personality traits, I'm an office worker living with parents, making over 46 million VND a month. That's a decent income, so maybe I can afford such products. But considering the ad's message—energy and appearance—I need to see if it aligns with my values.

I'm helpful and agreeable but not very talkative or outgoing. The ad might appeal more to someone social who cares about appearances, which isn't my primary concern. However, being original and imaginative is something I value, so the idea of a drink that helps look good could be somewhat appealing.

Regarding emotions, I get nervous sometimes and worry little, but I'm stable emotionally. The ad's focus on daily energizing might resonate if I need to stay focused at work. But I tend to be careless and not thorough, which makes me less likely to pay attention to such ads. 

For the attitude toward the advertisement: I don't strongly like it because it doesn't speak directly to my personality or needs. It's somewhat interesting due to the benefits mentioned, but not enough to make me believe it's good. The attractiveness is neutral as the message isn't tailored to me.

On purchase intention, I have no strong intent to buy since there are other products available. Trying it might happen if recommended elsewhere, and considering buying is possible but not certain.
