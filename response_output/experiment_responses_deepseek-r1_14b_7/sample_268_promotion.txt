Okay, let's break this down step by step. I'm a 30–39-year-old Chinese woman with a bachelor’s degree working as a blue-collar worker, currently divorced, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing, reserved, not helpful, not trusting, sometimes rude, careless, thorough, making plans, not nervous, worrying a lot, emotionally stable, having an active imagination, original, and few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to evaluate my attitude toward the advertisement. Let's go through each part:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, the message is about energy and looking good. Since I'm a working woman, maybe it resonates with me needing to stay energized for work. But being a blue-collar worker, maybe I don't prioritize appearance as much. So maybe a 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? It's a common claim, so not particularly unique. Maybe a 4 on interestingness.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's clear but lacks specifics. Without details, it might not be very convincing. So perhaps a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? The wording is simple and positive, which is good. But for me, maybe a 6 since it's somewhat appealing but not outstanding.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? As someone with a lower income, price might be a concern. Plus, I'm skeptical about the claims without evidence. Maybe a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? If I see it somewhere affordable and convenient, maybe I'll give it a shot. So a 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's on my radar, so a 5.
