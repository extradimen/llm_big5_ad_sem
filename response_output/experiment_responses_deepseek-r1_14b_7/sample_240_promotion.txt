Alright, so I need to figure out how to score my attitude towards this advertisement and my purchase intention. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target audience is a single male from China, aged 30-39, with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Personality traits include being talkative (neutral), outgoing (disagree), reserved (neutral), helpful (neutral), trusting (agree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), thorough (agree), makes plans and follows through (disagree), careless (neutral), gets nervous easily (strongly agree), worries a lot (disagree), emotionally stable (disagree), has an active imagination (agree), original with new ideas (strongly disagree), few artistic interests (agree).

Starting with attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The drink is positioned for energy and looking good. As someone who might be busy, staying energized could appeal. But considering income is high, maybe he's more focused on practical needs than appearance. Also, being reserved and sometimes rude—maybe not the most social person, so the "look your best" part might not resonate as much.
   - Score: 3 (Neutral)

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The promise of energy and looking good is broad but could be appealing if it's portrayed in a way that connects with his daily routine. However, considering he's a blue-collar worker, maybe more focused on functionality than aesthetics. Not sure how interesting it is to him.
   - Score: 4 (Agree)

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - To evaluate belief, the ad needs credibility. If the drink has proven benefits, he might agree. But without specific evidence, he's somewhat trusting but also tends to worry a lot and get nervous easily, which could make him skeptical.
   - Score: 4 (Agree)

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The message is positive, but given his personality traits like being reserved and not very outgoing, maybe it doesn't strongly attract him visually or emotionally. He might find it somewhat attractive but not compelling.
   - Score: 3 (Neutral)

Now, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - High income suggests he can afford it, but does the ad's message align with his values? He's thorough and trusts people but also gets nervous easily. The ad is vague—maybe not enough to drive intent without more specifics.
   - Score: 3 (Neutral)

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Without strong motivation or evidence, he might be hesitant to try it unless there are specific benefits highlighted. Maybe neutral here as well.
   - Score: 4 (Agree) – He's agreeable and trusting, so maybe more likely.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering his income level and the ad's message, he might give it thought but not immediately decide.
   - Score: 5 (Agree)

Wait, let me adjust. For purchase intention, maybe the scores should be lower since he's not very outgoing or trusting in some areas. Also, being nervous makes him cautious.

Revisiting:

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 3 (Neutral)
2. Try to buy: Maybe 4 (Agree) because he might feel inclined to try it once
3. Consider buying: 5 (Agree) as he's more likely to think about it

Alternatively, perhaps his tendency to be careless and sometimes rude doesn't align with taking the time to purchase something new. But given the ad's positive message, maybe he's somewhat open.

After reconsidering:

1. Intend to purchase: 3
2. Try to buy: 4
3. Consider buying: 5

Wait, but considering his income is high, he might be more willing to try products that offer benefits. Maybe the scores should reflect a slight interest without full commitment.
