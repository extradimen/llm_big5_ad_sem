Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down my thought process step by step.

First, looking at the demographic profile: I'm from China, female, under 20, in high school, not working, divorced, with a monthly income of 36–45 million VND. That's quite a comfortable income for Vietnam, so maybe affording such products isn't an issue.

Now, personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing/sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree (so I'm not reserved)
- Helpful/unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Agree
- Make plans/follow through: Agree
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Get nervous easily: Agree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original/new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Neutral

So, I'm talkative enough but not extremely. Outgoing and not reserved. Not particularly trusting or helpful, sometimes careless, get nervous easily, but don't worry a lot. I'm not very thorough, tend to be careless, make plans but might not follow through as much. Not very emotionally stable, nor do I have an active imagination or come up with new ideas.

The ad's main points are energy and looking good. Since I'm under 20 and in high school, I probably care about staying energized for school or social activities. Looking good is also important at that age, especially among peers.

However, considering my personality: I tend to be careless, so maybe I wouldn't pay much attention to ads. Also, the ad seems a bit generic—it doesn't specify how it helps with looking best, which might not appeal to me if there's no clear benefit or unique selling point. The claims seem too broad and vague.

I worry a lot: Strongly Disagree, but get nervous easily: Agree. So maybe stress-related products could be of interest, but the ad doesn't address that directly.

My income is high, so price might not be an issue, but without specific benefits or emotional appeal, I'm not convinced. Also, since I don't have an active imagination and am not original, the ad's message isn't particularly engaging to me.

Therefore, for the ad attitude scores:

1. Like: Since it's about energy and looking good, which are relevant, maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's okay but not really compelling, so 3.
3. Good: Not bad, but could be better; 4.
4. Attractive: Not very, since it's too generic; 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely because the ad doesn't convince me of its benefits enough; maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe I might consider trying once but not sure; 4.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, if someone recommends it or offers a discount; 5.

I think these scores reflect my cautious nature towards the product's claims and my tendency to be careless with such things.
