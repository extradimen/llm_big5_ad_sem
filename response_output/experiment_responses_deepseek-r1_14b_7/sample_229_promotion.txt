Alright, let me break down how I came up with these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Neutral. The ad's message is pretty generic and doesn't really connect with my personality traits. While being energetic and looking good sounds appealing, it's not tailored to someone who's outgoing but maybe a bit careless and nervous. So, I'm neutral on liking it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Neutral again. The ad doesn't offer anything unique or exciting. It just states the obvious benefits without any creative angle that would catch my attention given my personality.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Disagree. I don't find the ad convincing. It lacks specific details about how the drink actually works, which makes me skeptical. Since I tend to worry a lot and sometimes make careless decisions, credibility matters, and this ad doesn't provide enough to convince me.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Neutral. The visuals or message aren't particularly appealing. Without more information or an emotional hook, it doesn't stand out as attractive to me.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Disagree. While staying energized and looking good are nice, the ad doesn't provide enough reason for me to prioritize this product over others I might know about or trust more.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Neutral. Maybe if it's recommended elsewhere or if I see it somewhere else, but based solely on this ad, there's no strong motivation.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Disagree. There's not enough information to make me seriously think about purchasing it. My tendency towards being unhelpful and sometimes careless might lead me to overlook this without more compelling reasons.
