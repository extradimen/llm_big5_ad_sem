Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the demographic profile. The person is a Chinese male aged 50-59 with a postgraduate degree and works as a managerial employee. He has a monthly income between 16 million to 25 million VND, which is quite high. His marital status is divorced. 

Looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Strongly Agree – Wait, that's contradictory because being outgoing and reserved are opposites. Maybe he's both? But the scores show he strongly agrees to both, which might indicate a complex social nature.
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree – So he's not very helpful or unselfish.
- Generally trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Agree – He tends to be rude sometimes.
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree – Doesn't plan much or follow through.
- Careless: Neutral
- Gets nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree – So he's a worrier.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

Now, the ad is about a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day.

I need to evaluate how this person would feel towards the ad based on his traits. 

Starting with his attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
2. Interesting.
3. Good.
4. Attractive.

He's outgoing but sometimes rude, which might make him critical of ads that seem too pushy or not genuine. He worries a lot and isn't emotionally stable, so maybe he's more skeptical. His high income suggests he might be looking for quality products, but his disagreeable traits towards helpfulness and originality could affect his perception.

The ad's message is about energy and appearance, which are relevant to someone in their 50s managing a busy life. But the person doesn't plan much and is careless, so maybe he's not very influenced by such ads.

Looking at purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy.
2. Try to buy.
3. Consider buying.

He earns a lot but might be skeptical of products making grand claims. His tendency to worry a lot and being emotionally unstable could make him cautious about the product's effectiveness. Also, his neutral stance on thoroughness and planning suggests he might not follow through even if interested.

Putting it all together:

- Ad Attitude: He's somewhat neutral because while he's outgoing, his other traits like being a worrier and disagreeable towards helpfulness might make him indifferent or slightly critical.
- Purchase Intentions: Maybe low scores since the ad doesn't strongly resonate with his personality traits, especially his skepticism and lack of planning.

I think the scores would be on the lower end but not extremely negative. For example, for ad attitude, maybe around 3-4 on each point, indicating some neutral to slight disagreement. Purchase intentions could also be low, maybe 2-3, showing he might consider it but isn't strongly inclined to buy.
