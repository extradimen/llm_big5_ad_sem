 As a virtual assistant, I do not have personal feelings or emotions and cannot form opinions or attitudes towards anything. However, I can analyze the ad based on its content and structure to provide an objective evaluation. 

The advertisement describes a drink that claims to reduce tiredness and dullness. The product is being marketed as a solution for these problems, which could be appealing to those who feel fatigued or lack energy. 

Regarding the first question, "attitude toward the advertisement," I would score it as follows:
1. I like the ad. : 4 (The ad is visually appealing with an attractive color scheme and clear message.)
2. I think the ad is interesting. : 5 (The product is being sold to solve a common problem, which makes the ad intriguing.)
3. I believe the ad is good. : 7 (Based on its content and visual appeal, the ad seems effective in conveying its message.)
4. I find the ad attractive. : 6 (The ad has an engaging design that draws attention to the product.)

Regarding the second question, "purchase intention," I would score it as follows:
1. I intend to purchase this product. : 3 (While the ad may be interesting and believable, it does not provide enough information about the product or its price.)
2. I will try to buy this product. : 4 (The ad's message is persuasive, but more details would be necessary to determine if it's worth trying.)
3. I will consider buying this product. : 5 (Based on the limited information provided, the product seems like a potential option for those seeking energy or wellness solutions.)

Overall, while the ad may be effective in conveying its message and appealing to viewers, it could benefit from providing more detailed information about the product and its price.
