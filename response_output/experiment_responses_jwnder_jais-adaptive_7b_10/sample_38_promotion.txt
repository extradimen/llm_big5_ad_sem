 The ad is **neutral**. I don't feel strongly towards it either way. While it is interesting and visually appealing, the message doesn't resonate with me personally. I'm not sure why this drink would help me stay energized or look my best, especially since there are many ways to achieve those goals without consuming a product.

As for purchase intention, I **intend** to buy it. This might be due to the ad being so vague that I can imagine many uses for it in my daily life. For example, maybe it's good for staying alert at work or helping me look my best on a date. However, I don't think I would go out of my way to buy this product specifically; there are probably better options available that are more relevant to my lifestyle and needs.

Overall, while the ad is **interesting** and visually appealing, I find it lacking in substance and therefore not very persuasive.
