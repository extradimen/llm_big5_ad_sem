 The ad is trying to sell a drink that can prevent fatigue and dullness. It appeals to me as someone who values energy and youthful appearance. However, I do not plan on purchasing the product because it does not seem necessary for my lifestyle. Also, the claim that the drink can prevent dullness may be unrealistic or exaggerated. On a scale of 1-7, I would rate my attitude toward this ad as follows:

- I like the ad: 4 (Interesting)
- I think the ad is interesting: 4 (Good)
- I believe the ad is good: 3 (Attractive)
- I find the ad attractive: 4 (Like)

My purchase intention is low because I do not intend to buy this product. Although I am interested in the concept of preventing fatigue and dullness, there are many other ways that I can achieve those goals without purchasing a specific product. On a scale of 1-7, my purchase intention would be:

- I intend to purchase this product: 1 (Intend)
- I will try to buy this product: 2 (Try)
- I will consider buying this product: 3 (Consider)
