 The ad is a bit vague, but I believe it's trying to promote the idea that this drink can help you stay energized and look healthy. While I don't know much about the product, I think there are probably many other things we could do to improve our energy levels and appearance as well. Overall, I find the ad interesting but not particularly compelling.

My attitude toward the advertisement is 3 (interesting).

I am generally skeptical of such ads, so my purchase intention is low. I think I would only consider buying the product if it had some concrete evidence of its effectiveness. My score for that is 3 (consider).
