 Here is a possible response for the given situation:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": {
    "like": 1,
    "interesting": 2,
    "good": 3,
    "attractive": 4
  },
  "purchase_intention_scores": {
    "intend": 5,
    "try": 6,
    "consider": 7
  }
}
```
The ad type is prevention, indicating that the product aims to prevent some problem or condition. The attitude scores reflect my positive opinion of the advertisement but not necessarily the desire to buy the product. The purchase intention scores show my strong inclination towards buying the product due to its potential health benefits.
