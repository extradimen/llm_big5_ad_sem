 Here is an example of how the user's responses could be summarized using JSON format:

{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}

In this example, the user has a moderately positive attitude towards the ad and is undecided about purchasing it.
