 The ad has a positive connotation, which suggests that the drink can help you look and feel better. However, I do not think this product is necessary for me to achieve those goals. Moreover, while I find the ad attractive, it may be manipulative since it implies that without this drink, one will feel tired and dull. Overall, while I may like the ad and consider buying this product in some future scenarios (e.g., if I am feeling stressed), I do not plan to purchase it now. Therefore, my scores are:
- ad type: prevention
- ad attitude scores: [like, interesting, good, attractive]
- purchase intention scores: [intend, try, consider]
