 Here's an example of how you can format the JSON output based on my responses to the ad:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [7, 6, 5]
}

You can use this format and fill in the values based on your responses to the questions about the ad.
