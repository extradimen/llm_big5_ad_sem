 Here is the code to process the question:

```python
answers = {
    "ad_type": "prevention",
    "ad_attitude_scores": [1, 2, 3],
    "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

The `answers` dictionary contains the scores for each question as a list of integers, where 1 represents Strongly Disagree and 7 represents Strongly Agree. The key-value pairs correspond to the different questions being asked in the prompt.
