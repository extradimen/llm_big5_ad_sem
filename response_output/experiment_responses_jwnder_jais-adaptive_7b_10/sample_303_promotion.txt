 Here is a sample response to the prompt:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [6, 4, 5, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 3, 2]
}
```
In this response, the user believes that the ad is interesting and attractive, but not as much as they liked it. They also think the ad is good and believe in its benefits, but are uncertain about their purchase intentions. The final score is a combination of these factors, resulting in a low score for overall purchase intention.
