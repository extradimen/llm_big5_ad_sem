 The ad is not related to my interests and values. I don't like the way it's presented or the product being advertised. Therefore, my attitude towards the ad is negative (1), so I will choose 1 as my score for "I like the ad". Similarly, since I have no intention of buying this product, my purchase intention score is 1 (Strongly Disagree).\n
Overall, my reaction to this ad is that it's irrelevant and unappealing. I find nothing particularly interesting or good about it, nor do I think it would make me look better or feel energized in any way. In fact, based on its presentation alone, I can tell right away that there must be something wrong with either the product itself or how it was made into an ad. So my overall impression of this advertisement is negative (1), which means my score for "I find the ad attractive" will also be 1. As for whether I intend to purchase this product or try buying it, there's no way either option applies to me at all since neither one has any relevance whatsoever to my lifestyle. So my scores here will both be 1 (Strongly Disagree).\n
In summary, based on my personal background and values, as well as how I perceive this specific ad, its overall impact on me seems negative rather than positive; therefore, my final scores for each question will all be 1 (Strongly Disagree).
