 The ad is not very interesting and does not make me feel anything special. It's just an ordinary advertisement that I would probably ignore if it didn't mention the product being "energizing". I don't think this drink will help me look my best every day either, because looking your best isn't as easy as staying energized - it requires effort and dedication. The ad seems to be targeting people who are not very concerned about how they look, so it doesn't appeal to me at all. I wouldn't buy this product even if the ad was very persuasive because there are plenty of other drinks out there that can help me stay energized without making me look any better than I already do!

I would give this ad a score of 1 (strongly disagree) for both attitude toward the advertisement and purchase intention.
