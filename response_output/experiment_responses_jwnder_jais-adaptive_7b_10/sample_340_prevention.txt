 Here's an example of how I would answer the questions:

I like the ad because it uses a relatable scenario to convey its message. It makes me feel empathetic towards the person in the ad who is struggling with fatigue and dullness. While the ad could be more specific about the product and its benefits, overall I find it interesting and relevant to my lifestyle.
I think the ad is good because it effectively conveys its message and uses relatable language. However, I feel that there is room for improvement as far as the description of the drink itself is concerned. For instance, if the ad could provide more information about how the drink helps reduce fatigue or enhances energy levels, it would make me more inclined to purchase the product.
I find the ad attractive because of its simple design and effective use of colors. I also appreciate that the ad uses a realistic scenario instead of featuring an idealized version of the person in the ad. Overall, I believe the ad is good but there are areas where it could be improved to make it more appealing.

As for my purchase intention: 
I intend to purchase this product because I like the message conveyed by the ad and feel that the drink may help me with my daily struggles. I will try to buy this product as well, but only after doing some research on its effectiveness and safety. I will consider buying this product if I find out more information about it from other sources or if I am convinced of its benefits through word-of-mouth recommendations.
