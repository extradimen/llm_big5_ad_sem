 Here's a sample response to the prompt:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 6, 7, 5],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
This response shows that the user likes the ad (score of 4), finds it interesting (score of 6), and believes it's good (score of 7). The user also intends to purchase the product (score of 4), will try to buy it (score of 5), but may not consider buying it (score of 6). This response is an example of a balanced one, where the user finds the ad appealing but isn't convinced enough to actually buy the product.
