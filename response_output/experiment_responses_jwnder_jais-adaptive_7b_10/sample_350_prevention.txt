 The ad type is prevention. I like the ad because it talks about a health issue that many people have to deal with, which shows that the company cares about its customers' well-being. It makes me think twice before drinking too much soda and consider switching to another beverage option that will help me feel more energetic and less tired. The ad is interesting because it uses humor to grab my attention and get its message across, while also being informative at the same time. I believe that this ad is good because it uses a simple and effective strategy to reach out to potential customers who are already consuming soda but want to lead healthier lifestyles. It's attractive because it shows me that there's hope for those who feel like they can never change their habits when it comes to drinking sodas. I intend to purchase this product because I think it would be beneficial for my health, even if it's just in small doses every now and then. I will try to buy this product because the ad has given me a new perspective on how I can incorporate more nutritious options into my diet without sacrificing flavor or satisfaction.
