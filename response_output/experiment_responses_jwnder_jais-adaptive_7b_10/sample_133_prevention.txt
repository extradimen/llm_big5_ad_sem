 The ad was very informative and useful to me. I believe it is important to drink a lot of water as it helps us stay hydrated, which in turn can help reduce fatigue and dullness. Therefore, I find the ad interesting because I have never heard about this product before.

Although I agree with the main idea of the ad, I don't think that drinking more water will make me feel less tired or duller than usual. So my attitude towards the ad is neutral.

In terms of purchase intention, I intend to buy this product because I believe that drinking more water can help improve my health and energy levels. In addition, it seems like a good idea to try something new especially if it has potential benefits for me. Therefore, my score for purchase intention is high.

Overall, I would rate the ad as 3 out of 7 since while I found it useful and informative, I don't think drinking more water will make much difference in how tired or dull I feel on a daily basis.
