 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to interact with external websites or advertisements. Therefore, I do not have any information about the specific ad you mentioned and am unable to evaluate its content. However, I can provide general advice on how to approach such tasks:

When evaluating an advertisement, consider factors like its relevance to your personal needs and interests, its credibility, and its overall quality of presentation. Does it present a compelling argument for the product or service being promoted? Do the visuals and language used align with the message they are trying to convey? 

As for purchase intention, think about whether you would be likely to purchase the product based on your knowledge of it from the ad alone. Consider factors like its price point, the benefits and features it offers, and how well it meets your needs or addresses a problem you have. 

Remember that advertisements are often designed to persuade viewers to take some kind of action, whether that's making a purchase, trying a product, or simply thinking more about it. Be critical in assessing their effectiveness and relevance to you personally.
