 Here is an example of how the output should be formatted in JSON:
```json
{
    "ad_type": "prevention",
    "ad_attitude_scores": {
        "like": 7,
        "interesting": 6,
        "good": 5,
        "attractive": 4
    },
    "purchase_intention_scores": {
        "intend": 6,
        "try": 4,
        "consider": 3
    }
}
```
