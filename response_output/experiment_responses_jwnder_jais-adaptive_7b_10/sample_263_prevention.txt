 Here is an example of how you can format your response:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [3, 2, 1]
}
```
In this example, the user has a very positive attitude towards the advertisement and is considering purchasing the product. The lowest score is a 4 on the scale of 7, which means that while they found the ad interesting and good, they do not find it particularly attractive.
