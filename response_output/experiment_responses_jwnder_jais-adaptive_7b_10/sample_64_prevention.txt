 Here is an example of a correct JSON response for the task:

```json
{
    "ad_type": "prevention",
    "ad_attitude_scores": [7, 6, 5, 4],
    "purchase_intention_scores": [4, 3, 2]
}
```

This JSON response indicates that the user likes the ad, finds it interesting and good, but doesn't find it attractive. The user has a moderate purchase intention score for the product, with most of them considering buying or trying to buy it, while only a few intend to purchase it immediately.
