Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores:
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral leaning towards Agree because it's a positive message about energy and appearance, which appeals to me.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly above neutral as it promises benefits that are of interest but not particularly unique or engaging.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Neutral due to lack of detail on how the drink achieves its claims and a general skepticism about such broad statements.
  4. I find the ad attractive (5): Slightly more than neutral because it addresses energy and appearance, which are appealing but not overly so given my personality traits.
- Purchase Intention Scores:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree as there is no strong evidence of why I should trust the claims made by the ad.
  2. I will try to buy this product (2): Disagree because, while I might consider it, my tendency towards skepticism and lack of thoroughness in making plans makes me less likely to actively pursue purchase.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): Neutral as there is some appeal in the benefits mentioned but not enough information or personal motivation to strongly commit to considering it.
