Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**:
  1. I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive because it aligns with my interest in staying energized and looking good, which are concerns of someone who might worry a lot about their appearance and performance at work.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly more positive than neutral as it presents a claim that could be appealing if it were backed by credible evidence or testimonials.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral to slightly negative because, while it has an appeal, there's not enough information provided to fully evaluate its goodness without skepticism.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 6): More positive as it touches on a desire for energy and looking one's best, which could be particularly appealing given my profile that includes being a civil servant who might need to maintain a professional appearance and demeanor.

- **Purchase intention**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low intent because while the ad is somewhat attractive, there isn't enough information or trust in the claim to strongly commit to purchasing without further research.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 3): Moderate intent as it suggests an openness to consider buying if more information becomes available that addresses my concerns and aligns with my values.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 4): Higher consideration due to the potential appeal of looking one's best, but still requires convincing evidence or a personal recommendation before making a final decision.
