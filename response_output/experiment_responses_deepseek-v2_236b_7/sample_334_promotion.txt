Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (Score: 3) - Neutral stance; it doesn't particularly stand out as a favorite but is not disliked either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4) - Slightly above neutral, indicating some interest due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score: 2) - Below neutral; while it's not offensive, there's skepticism about whether a drink can truly deliver on such broad claims without more specific information.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score: 5) - Somewhat agree; the promise of looking one's best and staying energized is appealing to many, including this demographic profile.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree; without more information or evidence of effectiveness, there isn't a strong intent to buy based on the ad alone.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score: 2) - Disagree; while not completely dismissing the possibility, there is no immediate plan to seek out and purchase the product.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score: 3) - Neutral; considering doesn't mean commitment but leaves open the option if more compelling information or a personal recommendation arises.
