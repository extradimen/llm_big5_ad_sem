Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (Score: 4) - Neutral to slightly positive feeling about the ad; it's not particularly appealing but doesn't repel me either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5) - Slightly above neutral because of curiosity about how a drink can help with energy and appearance.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score: 3) - Below neutral, as there's skepticism based on my reserved nature and tendency to be thorough in evaluating claims.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score: 6) - Above neutral because of my artistic interests; I appreciate creative marketing even if it doesn't fully align with my values or preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree, as the ad hasn't convinced me enough based on my skeptical and untrusting nature.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score: 2) - Disagree; while there is some interest, it doesn't translate into a strong intention to seek out the product immediately.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score: 3) - Neutral stance; if presented with the opportunity and further information that addresses my skepticism, I might consider it.
