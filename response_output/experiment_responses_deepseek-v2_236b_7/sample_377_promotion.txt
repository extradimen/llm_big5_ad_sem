Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6), as it speaks to energy and appearance, which can be appealing. It is moderately interesting (score 5) because staying energized could be relevant for an office worker who values thoroughness in their job. However, while not unattractive, I don't necessarily think the ad is particularly good or memorable (score 3), and my like for it is only moderate (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: The intention to purchase is low (score 2) because although the ad has some appeal, as a divorced individual with a postgraduate degree and a focus on stability, I may not be easily swayed by such claims without further information or credibility. I might try it if there's an opportunity, but my consideration for buying this product would depend on other factors (score 3). The initial intention to buy is not strong (score 1), as the ad alone does not provide enough reason to commit to a purchase.
