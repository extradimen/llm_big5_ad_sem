  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Finds some aspects intriguing, which might be due to curiosity about how a drink can help with staying energized and looking one's best.
  3. I believe the ad is good (4): The ad seems well-constructed but does not elicit a strong personal endorsement of its quality.
  4. I find the ad attractive (5): Slightly more positive than neutral, indicating that there is an attraction to some elements within the advertisement, possibly due to the aspirational nature of looking one's best every day.
