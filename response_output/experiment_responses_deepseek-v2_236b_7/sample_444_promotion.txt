Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: The ad is somewhat liked (score 4), finds it interesting (score 5), but only moderately good (score 3). It's attractive to me because of my creative and artistic interests (score 6).
- **Purchase Intention**: I have a low intention to purchase right away (score 2), with minimal effort to try to buy it (score 1), but will consider the product when making purchasing decisions (score 3). This reflects my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious about new products.
