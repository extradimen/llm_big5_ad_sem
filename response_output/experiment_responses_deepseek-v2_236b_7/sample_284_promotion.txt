Explanation:
- The advertisement is generally appealing to me due to my outgoing and sociable personality. I find it attractive (score 6) because staying energized aligns with my need to be active in social situations. However, while the ad is good (score 5) and interesting (score 5), there's a slight reservation about its claim of helping "look your best" which doesn't resonate as strongly (hence like score at 4).
- My purchase intention is moderate. I would consider buying the product (score 4) due to my agreement with making plans and following through, but being generally trusting isn't one of my traits, so a strong intent to buy or trying it immediately (scores 2 and 3 respectively) seems more appropriate given my cautious nature.
