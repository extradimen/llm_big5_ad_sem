Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it somewhat interesting and attractive (scores 4 and 5), but not overwhelmingly good or likeable (scores 4 and 3). The ad's claim about staying energized aligns with my need for focus at work, which is why it's moderately appealing. However, as someone who values thoroughness and follows through on plans, I would likely seek more information before making a decision.
- Purchase intention: While the ad captures some interest (scores 3, 4), my reserved nature and tendency to worry mean that I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product (score 2). Instead, I will consider it further (scores 3, 3) but would likely conduct additional research or seek recommendations before trying a new drink. My skepticism about emotional stability also contributes to this cautious approach.
