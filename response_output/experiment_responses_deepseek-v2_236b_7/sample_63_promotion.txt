Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 4), but it's not particularly interesting to me (score 3). I don't think it's a good ad overall because it doesn't seem very credible or tailored to my interests (score 2). And finally, I do not strongly like the ad (score 1) as it feels generic and lacks personal relevance.
- **Purchase intention:** Given my skepticism about the claims made in the ad, I have no intention of purchasing this product at the moment (score 1), nor am I actively planning to try it out (score 1). However, if there is a compelling reason or further information that convinces me of its benefits, I might consider buying it (score 2), but this consideration would be contingent on additional factors.
