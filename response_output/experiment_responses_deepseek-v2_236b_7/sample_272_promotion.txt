Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I moderately like the ad (score 5) because it aligns with my outgoing and sociable personality. It seems interesting to me as a manager who values staying energized (score 6), but I'm not completely convinced about its claim of looking one's best every day, hence only a moderate belief that it is good (score 4). The attractiveness of the ad doesn't resonate strongly with my artistic interests or originality (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does catch my attention, I am not fully convinced to immediately purchase the product (score 2), nor do I intend to make an effort to buy it right away. However, given that staying energized is important for my job as a manager, I may consider buying this product if other factors such as reviews and price align favorably (score 3).
