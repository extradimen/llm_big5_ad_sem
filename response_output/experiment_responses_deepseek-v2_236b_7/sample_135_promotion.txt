Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As an individual who is outgoing and sociable (agree), I find the ad interesting (score 5) because it appeals to my desire to look good and be energized for social interactions. However, my reserved nature makes me less likely to strongly agree with finding the ad attractive (score 3). The claim of helping to "look your best" is appealing but not a strong selling point due to my neutral stance on making plans and following through with them.
- **Purchase intention**: Although I find some aspects of the ad interesting, my educational background as a postgraduate might make me more critical about product claims without substantial evidence. Therefore, while I am open to considering buying this product (score 3), I do not have a strong intent to purchase it immediately or feel compelled to try it right away (score 2). My worry and emotional instability may also contribute to my cautious approach towards new products.
