Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral agreement. The advertisement is not particularly appealing to me but it doesn't repel me either. It presents a claim that could be relevant for some people who are looking for energy and appearance enhancement, which does not strongly align with my personal values or needs at this age.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more positive than neutral as it offers a promise of benefits that might intrigue those interested in such products, but it doesn't necessarily resonate deeply with me personally due to my demographic and personality traits.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Again, neutral agreement. The advertisement seems like an average commercial trying to sell its product based on common consumer desires for energy and appearance improvement without any significant flaws or outstanding qualities that would make it particularly 'good' from my perspective.
- I find the ad attractive (score 2): Slightly negative as the term "attractive" implies a stronger appeal than what this advertisement holds for me given my demographic profile, education level, and tendency to be cautious in trusting claims made by ads.

As for purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree since there's no compelling reason within the ad or based on my current needs/preferences that would lead me to actively seek out and buy this particular drink.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): Also strongly disagree as even though it might be a slight step up from merely intending, it still implies an effort towards acquiring the item which isn't justified by my reaction to the ad or personal circumstances.
- I will consider buying this product (score 2): Slightly less negative than outright rejection but still leaning towards disagreement - while not completely dismissing the possibility of considering the purchase if other factors were present such as a recommendation from someone trustworthy, an actual demonstration of effectiveness, etc., it remains unlikely given my current stance based on this advertisement alone.
