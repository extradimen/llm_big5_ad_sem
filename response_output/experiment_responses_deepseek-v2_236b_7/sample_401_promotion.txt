Explanation: As a young male student living with parents in China, earning VND (Vietnamese Dong) which is not my local currency and having specific personality traits such as being talkative, outgoing, helpful, trusting, thorough, emotionally stable, original with few artistic interests; the advertisement for an energy drink that claims to help stay energized and look one's best resonates somewhat with me. I find it likable (6) and interesting (5), but not particularly attractive (4). However, my purchase intention is low due to the currency discrepancy and potential lack of relevance to my personal needs or preferences at this time, hence scores 3, 2, and 1 for intent, trying, and considering respectively.
