Explanation of the scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I moderately like the ad (score 5), find it quite interesting and good (scores 6 each), but only somewhat attractive (score 4). As an educated individual with a postgraduate degree, I appreciate creativity and innovation. The claim that the drink helps one stay energized and look their best is appealing to my talkative nature and desire for thoroughness in my job performance. However, my skepticism and distrust of claims without substantial evidence lead me to not find it as attractive as it could be if more substantiated.
- Purchase intention: I am somewhat open to considering the product (score 4), but do not have a strong intent to purchase right away (score 3) or an immediate plan to try it out (score 2). My worry and emotional instability make me cautious about new products, especially those that promise significant benefits without clear evidence. Additionally, while I am helpful and unselfish with others, my reserved nature means I approach purchases thoughtfully rather than impulsively.
