Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat good (score 4), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score 1). It's interesting enough to catch my attention (score 2) and has a positive feel, so it gets an overall neutral score for liking it (score 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me, I might consider buying the product if it aligns with my needs (score 2), but I don't have a strong intention to purchase immediately (score 1). The possibility of considering it is there, especially if other factors like price and necessity come into play (score 3).
