Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 4) and interesting (score 5), which aligns with my outgoing personality and artistic interests. However, I believe it is only a good ad to an extent (score 3) as there's no clear evidence of its claims being true.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile, the product may not be targeted at me specifically due to my age and income level. Therefore, while I find the ad somewhat appealing, my purchase intentions are low with a score of 1 for intending to buy, 2 for trying to buy (which implies some consideration), and 3 for considering it as an option but with reservations.
