Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The ad is moderately liked (4), finds it somewhat interesting (5), but not entirely convinced that it's a good ad (3). However, the visual aspect and message are attractive to me (6) as someone who appreciates originality.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: There is some intention to purchase the product if there's an opportunity (2), willing to try it out (1), but also open to considering other options (3), reflecting a balance between trust in general and being careful with choices, given my occupation as a blue-collar worker.
