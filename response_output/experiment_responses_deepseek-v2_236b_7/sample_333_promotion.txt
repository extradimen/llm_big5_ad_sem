Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement. It is not particularly attractive to me personally due to my reserved nature and lack of artistic interests (score 5 for "attractive"), but it does seem interesting enough (score 4 for "interesting") and good in terms of its message (score 3 for "good"). The score for liking the ad is lower at 3, as I am not particularly drawn to talkative or outgoing promotions.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase this product is low due to my reserved nature and tendency to make thorough decisions before purchasing (score 2 for "try" which means I might look into it but with skepticism). The score for considering the purchase is at a moderate level of 3, indicating that while the ad does not strongly persuade me, it has caught my attention enough to consider further investigation. The intention to actually buy the product without further consideration (score 1 for "intend") is low, reflecting my cautious approach to new products and need for thorough evaluation before making a purchase decision.
