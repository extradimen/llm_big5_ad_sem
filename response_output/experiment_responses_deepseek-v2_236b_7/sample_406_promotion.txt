Explanation:
- The advertisement is moderately liked (score of 3), as it seems to be promoting a product that could potentially help with energy and appearance. However, the skepticism in trusting others (Strongly Disagree) may lead to a lower score on finding the ad good (score of 2). It's found attractive to some extent (score of 5) because of its promise but not overwhelmingly so due to the lack of artistic interests.
- The purchase intention is low, with no strong intent to buy (score of 1), as there might be doubts about the product's claims. There is a slight willingness to try it out (score of 2) and consideration for future purchases (score of 3), but these are cautious steps rather than firm commitments due to the reserved nature towards trusting products without thorough research.
