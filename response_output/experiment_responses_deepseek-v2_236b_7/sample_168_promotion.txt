Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it aligns with my talkative and outgoing nature that values staying energized. However, while I think it's interesting enough to catch my attention (score 5), I don't necessarily believe it is good overall (score 3). The claim of looking one's best every day feels a bit superficial to me, hence the lower score for 'good'.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad attractive, my intention to purchase the product is not strong. I would consider buying it (score 3) if there was more information on how it specifically helps with energy and appearance. A low initial intention to try (score 1) indicates skepticism about whether trying the product will actually lead to noticeable results. The moderate score of 2 for intending to purchase reflects a cautious approach based on my neutral stance towards making plans and following through with them.
