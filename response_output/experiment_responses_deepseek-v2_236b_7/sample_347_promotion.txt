Explanation:
- As a reserved and somewhat skeptical individual (Strongly Agree on being reserved, Disagree on being generally trusting), I find the advertisement moderately interesting and not particularly attractive. It is neither compelling nor unappealing to me, hence scores of 3 for "interesting" and "good," with a lower score of 2 for "attractive."
- My purchase intention is low due to my reserved nature and skepticism. While I might consider buying the product (score of 3), there is no strong intent or immediate plan to try it out (scores of 1 and 2).
