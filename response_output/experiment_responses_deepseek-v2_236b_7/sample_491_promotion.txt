Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing as it suggests that the drink can help with energy and appearance, which are relevant to a managerial employee who might need to look and perform their best. However, there's some skepticism about whether a simple drink can deliver on such broad claims, hence the moderate scores for liking (4), finding it interesting (5), considering it good (3), but not overly attractive (4).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is somewhat appealing, it doesn't strongly convince me to immediately purchase the product. I might consider buying it if there were more compelling evidence or testimonials (consider score of 3), and I would try to buy it if my peers recommended it or if it was on sale (try score of 1). The intention to actually purchase right away is low, as indicated by the intend score of 2.
