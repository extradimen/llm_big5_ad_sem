Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I have a generally positive view of the ad. It's not extremely attractive to me personally (score 4), but it does catch my attention and seems interesting (score 6). The claim about staying energized is appealing, although looking one's best is less relevant to me at this stage in life.
- **Purchase intention**: While I find the ad somewhat persuasive, my purchase intent is not high due to limited income as a student. However, if it fits within my budget and seems beneficial, I might consider trying it (score 3), but I'm not strongly inclined to buy immediately (score 2).
