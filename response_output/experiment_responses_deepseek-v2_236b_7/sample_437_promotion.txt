Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive (scoring a 4), it's not particularly compelling in terms of being good or likable. The claim about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but also vague, hence the lower scores for "good" and "like".
- Purchase intention: Given my demographic profile as a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree, I might be skeptical about the actual benefits of such a product. Additionally, my income bracket suggests that while not poor, I may still prioritize spending on essentials over luxury or lifestyle products. Therefore, my intention to purchase is low (scoring a 1 for "intend"), but there's some openness to considering it (scoring a 3 for "consider") and even trying it if the opportunity arises without significant investment (scoring a 2 for "try").
