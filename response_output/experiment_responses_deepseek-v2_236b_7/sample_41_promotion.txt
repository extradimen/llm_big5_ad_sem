Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 3 for 'I like the ad'), moderately interesting (score 4), and generally good (score 4). The claim that it helps stay energized is a positive aspect. However, I am not strongly attracted to it (score 5) as there may be skepticism about looking one's best every day based on just a drink.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is moderately appealing, my purchase intent is relatively low. I would consider buying the product if it aligns with my budget and health considerations (score 3), but I am not strongly driven to immediately try or intend to buy it (scores 2 for both). This reflects a cautious approach due to my reserved nature and general trust issues.
