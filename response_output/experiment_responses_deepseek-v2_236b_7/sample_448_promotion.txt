Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude:** I have a generally positive view of the advertisement. It's not extremely attractive to me, but it does catch my attention and seems interesting (score 4). The claim that the drink helps stay energized is appealing, as energy is something many office workers seek during their workday. However, the part about looking one's best every day feels a bit superficial for my taste, hence the slightly lower scores on likeability and attractiveness (scores 3 and 6 respectively).
- **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting, my purchase intention is not very high. The product seems useful in theory, but I'm not particularly swayed by ads to begin with, so I would need more information or a personal recommendation before considering it (score 4 for "consider"). I might look into it if there were promotions or discounts that make trying the product less of a risk (scores 2 and 1 respectively for "try" and "intend").
