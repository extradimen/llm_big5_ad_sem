Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: The ad seems to be targeting a general appeal for energy and appearance enhancement, which can resonate with many consumers. However, as an individual who is reserved (Strongly Agree), the advertisement's assertiveness might not strongly align with my personality. Nonetheless, I find it somewhat interesting (4) and attractive (5) because of its universal message about looking good and feeling energized. The score for "I think the ad is good" is lower (2) as I am generally trusting but also cautious, which makes me skeptical of claims without more information.
- **Purchase Intention**: Given my demographic profile, particularly being a student with limited income, immediate purchase intention is low (1). However, if there was significant need or positive reviews from trusted sources, it could be considered (3), and I might try to buy the product in certain circumstances (2) such as if it fits within budget constraints or if recommended by someone I trust.
