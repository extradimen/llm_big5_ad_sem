Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing with a focus on energy and appearance. As someone who is reserved and not particularly outgoing or sociable (Strongly Agree to being reserved), the ad's emphasis on looking one's best resonates more than its energizing aspect, hence the slightly higher score for attractiveness (5). The belief that the ad is good is lower (2) because while it may be attractive, there isn't a strong sense of personal connection or conviction.
- **Purchase intention**: Given the neutral stance on worrying and emotional stability, as well as being generally trusting, there is an openness to consider new products (3). However, without a strong agreement on making plans and following through with them, the intent to purchase (1) and actively try to buy it (2) are lower.
