Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I have a generally positive view of the ad. It's not my favorite type of advertising, but it doesn't bother me either. The claim that the drink helps stay energized is somewhat appealing to someone who values thoroughness and follows through with plans (scores 3, 4, 5 for like, interesting, good). I find it moderately attractive because it aligns with my outgoing nature and desire to look presentable (score 4 for attractive).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is not particularly persuasive or unique in its message, it does trigger some consideration due to my need for energy as a civil servant. However, given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income), I am cautious about any additional expenses (scores 2, 3, 3 for intend, try, consider). The ad has not created a strong desire to immediately purchase the product, but it's not entirely dismissed either.
