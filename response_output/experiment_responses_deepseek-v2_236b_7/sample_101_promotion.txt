Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** The ad is somewhat appealing to me (score 4 for like), it's moderately interesting (score 5 for interesting), I think it's decent but not outstanding (score 4 for good), and it's mildly attractive, though not particularly compelling (score 3 for attractive).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad is not unappealing, my intention to purchase the product is low. I might consider buying it if there are other factors such as a recommendation from someone or a special offer (score 2 for try), but at this moment, I'm not strongly inclined to buy it immediately (score 1 for intend) and would rather keep it as an option among others (score 3 for consider).
