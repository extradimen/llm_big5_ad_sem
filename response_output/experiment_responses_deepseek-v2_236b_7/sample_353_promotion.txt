Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately appealing (score 4 for liking), somewhat interesting (score 5), and generally good (score 4). However, while it is attractive to some extent, I don't find it particularly so (score 3).
  
- **Purchase intention:** My intent to purchase the product is low; I might consider trying it out of curiosity (score 2) but not with a strong commitment. There is also a possibility that I will consider buying the product in the future, depending on other factors such as reviews or recommendations from trusted sources (score 3).
