Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly appealing but it's also not off-putting.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Mildly interested in what the ad has to offer, as it mentions staying energized and looking one's best, which can be relevant for anyone.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): The ad seems decent but not outstanding; there's no strong belief that it stands out among other ads of its kind.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): There's a higher level of interest in the attractiveness of the message, as staying energized and looking one's best is an appealing concept for many people.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): It's unlikely that there would be immediate intent to buy without further information or a compelling reason, but it's not ruled out entirely.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): There is no strong motivation to actively seek out and purchase the product based on the ad alone.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): The product may be considered for purchase if other factors such as reviews, price, or personal needs align favorably with it.
