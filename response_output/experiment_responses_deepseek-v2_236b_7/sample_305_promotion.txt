Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it aligns with my outgoing and sociable personality, suggesting that staying energized could help me in social situations. However, I'm not entirely convinced it is good or interesting (scores 3 and 5), as I have a strong imagination and original ideas, which makes me skeptical of claims without more innovative content. I moderately like the ad (score 4) because while it doesn't fully resonate with my artistic interests, it does appeal to my desire for energy in social settings.
- **Purchase intention**: I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product immediately (score 1), but I might try to buy it if there is a compelling offer or testimonial that addresses my trust issues (score 2). I will consider buying the product (score 3) because, despite my reservations about thoroughness and potential carelessness in decision-making, staying energized aligns with my sociable nature.
