Explanation of scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad moderately likeable (4) as it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. It is interesting enough to hold my attention (5), but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as 'good' in a general sense (3). However, I do find it visually attractive, which makes me more receptive to the message (6).
- Purchase Intention Scores: While the ad has some appeal, my intention to purchase is not strong. I might consider trying the product if there was an opportunity or promotion that made it convenient (2), but without a compelling reason, I'm unlikely to actively seek out the purchase (1). The consideration score reflects that while the ad caught my attention, I am still on the fence about whether this product would be worth buying (3).
