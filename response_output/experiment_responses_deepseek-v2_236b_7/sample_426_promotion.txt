Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**

  2. I think the ad is interesting: 5 (Somewhat agree) - It presents a common desire for staying energized and looking good, making it slightly more than just mildly interesting.
  3. I believe the ad is good: 3 (Neutral) - While not strongly agreeing, the ad does convey a clear message about its benefits, but it's not particularly outstanding or innovative in my view.
  4. I find the ad attractive: 4 (Moderately agree) - The promise of energy and looking one's best is generally attractive to many consumers, including myself.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product: 2 (Slightly disagree) - While the ad is somewhat appealing, it does not strongly motivate me to make an immediate purchase.
  2. I will try to buy this product: 1 (Strongly disagree) - There isn't enough information or personal motivation for me to actively seek out buying the product based on the ad alone.
  3. I will consider buying this product: 3 (Neutral) - The ad presents a potential benefit, so it might be something to keep in mind and possibly consider if other factors align with my preferences and needs at a later time.
