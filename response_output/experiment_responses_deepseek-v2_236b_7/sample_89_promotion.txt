Explanation: As a young male in a managerial position with an outgoing personality and a focus on originality and new ideas, the advertisement's claim of staying energized and looking one's best aligns somewhat with my interests. I find it attractive (score 6) as it appeals to my desire for energy and appearance, which are relevant to my occupation. However, my skepticism and thorough nature lead me to be cautious about fully agreeing that I like the ad (score 3), but I do find it interesting (score 4) and good enough (score 5).

In terms of purchase intention, while I am not immediately convinced to buy the product (intend score 2), I would consider trying it out (try score 3) or at least considering buying it if there's more information that backs up its claims (consider score 4). My worry and skepticism prevent a stronger intent without further convincing evidence.
