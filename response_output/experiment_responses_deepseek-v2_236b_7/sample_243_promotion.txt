Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat interesting and good (scoring a 4 and 5 respectively), which suggests it has some appeal. However, the score for liking the ad is lower at 3, indicating a moderate level of appreciation but not strong enthusiasm. The attractiveness score is also relatively low at 2, suggesting that while there's interest, the visual or emotional appeal isn't particularly high.
- **Purchase intention**: The scores for purchase intentions are all on the lower end (1, 2, and 3), indicating a very tentative stance towards actually buying the product. This suggests that while the ad has caught attention to some extent, it hasn't created a strong desire or conviction to make a purchase immediately.
