  1. I like the ad (score 3): Neutral leaning slightly towards liking due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral, as it does present a claim that could be intriguing.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 2): Below neutral, expressing skepticism about the overall quality or veracity of the claims made in the advertisement.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly above neutral because the promise of looking one's best can be appealing, even if it doesn't align fully with my personality traits.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagreeing, as there is no strong intention based on the advertisement alone.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 2): Slightly above strongly disagreeing but still not a clear intent to actively seek out and purchase the product.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral, meaning that while there is no strong intention or plan to buy right now, the possibility remains open for future consideration if other factors align favorably.
