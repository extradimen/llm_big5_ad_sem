Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I am generally outgoing and sociable, which makes me more receptive to advertisements that promise social benefits like looking my best. However, being reserved and having a tendency to worry a lot means I'm not easily swayed by ads without some skepticism. The ad is attractive (score 5) because it appeals to the desire to look good, but I am cautious about its claims (good score 2). It's interesting enough (4) to catch my attention, but I don't strongly like it (3) due to my reserved nature and potential skepticism.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad is attractive and somewhat interesting, my intention to purchase (1) is low because of my neutral stance on emotional stability and being thorough in my job, which translates to a need for more information before making a purchasing decision. I might try to buy it (2), but only after considering other options or verifying its claims (3). My financial situation also plays a role in not having a strong intention to purchase without careful consideration.
