Explanation of the scores:
- The ad is moderately liked (score 4) as it aligns with my outgoing personality and interest in looking my best. However, there's a degree of skepticism due to the trust factor (Disagree on being generally trusting).
- It's considered interesting (score 5) because it taps into the desire for energy, which is appealing to a student lifestyle, but not exceptionally good or attractive as the claim seems somewhat generic and could be seen as an overpromise.
- The purchase intention scores reflect low intent to buy immediately (1), with some willingness to try if circumstances allow (2), and more likely consideration in the future (3) depending on additional information about the product's credibility and effectiveness.
