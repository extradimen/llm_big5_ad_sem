  1. Like the ad: 3 (Neutral) - The ad doesn't strongly appeal to my personal preferences, but I can see its potential appeal to others.
  2. Interesting: 4 (Slightly Agree) - The claim of staying energized and looking one's best is a common desire that makes it potentially interesting to many.
  3. Good: 2 (Disagree slightly) - While the ad has a clear message, I am skeptical about its claims without more information or credibility indicators.
  4. Attractive: 5 (Agree somewhat) - The promise of energy and appearance enhancement can be attractive to those looking for such benefits.

  1. Intend to purchase: 1 (Strongly Disagree) - The ad does not persuade me enough to intend to buy the product right away.

  3. Consider buying: 3 (Neutral) - The ad leaves room for consideration if other factors support the product's claims and benefits.
