Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agree. The advertisement seems to offer a positive benefit with its promise of energy and looking one's best, which could appeal to my desire for original ideas and personal improvement.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Agree slightly. While not particularly outgoing or sociable, I can appreciate an ad that presents itself as helpful in daily life, even if it doesn't align with all of my personality traits.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Disagree slightly. The lack of detail about how the drink achieves its stated benefits makes me skeptical and less trusting of the advertisement.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Agree leaning towards neutral. While not strongly attracted, the promise of energy and looking one's best is a universal appeal that could be relevant to my demographic profile.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. The advertisement does not provide enough information or credibility for me to consider purchasing it at this time.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree slightly. While the ad has some appeal, my general distrust and tendency towards thoroughness make me unlikely to actively seek out this product without more convincing evidence.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agree. If further information or reviews were provided that convinced me of its benefits, it's possible I could consider purchasing the drink at a later time.
