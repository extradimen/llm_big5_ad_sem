Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**:
   - I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but not overwhelmingly so for this demographic profile.
   - I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly above neutral, indicating that while it doesn't particularly stand out, it does hold some interest due to its promise of energy enhancement.
   - I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral to slightly negative. The lack of details about how the drink achieves these benefits makes the claim seem less credible.
   - I find the ad attractive (score 6): More positive, as it appeals to vanity and personal well-being, which are generally attractive propositions for many consumers.

- **Purchase intention**:
   - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low intent, reflecting skepticism about whether the advertised benefits can be delivered by the product.
   - I will try to buy this product (score 1): Very low intent, indicating that there is little motivation to actively seek out and purchase the product based on the ad alone.
   - I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral intent, suggesting that while not completely dismissing the possibility of purchasing, it's not a priority or an immediate plan.
