Explanation:
- I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 3) because it appeals to my desire to look and feel good. However, as someone who is skeptical by nature ("I am generally trusting.: Strongly Disagree"), I'm not fully convinced of its claims ("I believe the ad is good.: Score 6" but not a strong agreement).
- The ad is interesting enough for me to give it some attention (score 5), and I do find it somewhat likable, though not overwhelmingly so (score 4).
- My purchase intention reflects my cautious nature. While I'm open to considering the product (score 3), I don't have a strong intent to buy right away (score 1) but might try if there are compelling reasons or reviews that support its claims (score 2).
