Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral agreement. The advertisement is appealing but not particularly outstanding to me as a talkative and outgoing individual with an active imagination.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly above neutral because of my original nature, which finds new ideas intriguing.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral agreement again, acknowledging that it's a well-made advertisement but not necessarily resonating strongly with my values or preferences.
- I find the ad attractive (score 2): Slightly below neutral because while I have artistic interests, they are few and this advertisement doesn't particularly appeal to those limited interests.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. The low income and my occupation as a blue-collar worker make me cautious about unnecessary spending on products that claim to provide energy but may not be essential for my daily needs.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Neutral disagreement, leaning towards trying it out if the price is right and there's an opportunity, but with reservations due to financial constraints.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Slightly above neutral because while I am not immediately drawn to purchase, my outgoing nature might lead me to consider it for a special occasion or as a treat if circumstances allow.
