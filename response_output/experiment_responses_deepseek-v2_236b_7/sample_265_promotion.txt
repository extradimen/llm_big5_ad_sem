Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I have a somewhat positive view of the ad. It's not particularly exciting or new for someone my age who may be more focused on health than appearance, but it does suggest a benefit that could appeal to anyone looking for an energy boost. The scoring reflects this mixed response:
  - "I like the ad." (3/7): Neutral-leaning positive. It's not unlikable, but not particularly engaging either.
  - "I think the ad is interesting." (4/7): Slightly more positive because it does propose a benefit that could be of interest.
  - "I believe the ad is good." (3/7): Again, neutral-leaning positive; it's a standard claim without any glaring issues or uniqueness.
  - "I find the ad attractive." (5/7): More positive here because of the potential appeal to look one's best, which could resonate with some at any age.

- **Purchase intention:** The scores for purchase intention reflect that while I might consider the product, my trust issues and skepticism about such claims make me unlikely to actually intend or try to buy it:
  - "I intend to purchase this product." (1/7): Strongly disagree; based on my personality traits indicating a strong distrust of general statements without evidence.
  - "I will try to buy this product." (2/7): Disagree; I'm not inclined to actively seek out the purchase, but it's not completely ruled out if other factors support its credibility.
  - "I will consider buying this product." (3/7): Neutral-leaning agree; considering doesn't mean committing, and there might be room for consideration if more information or evidence is provided to back up the ad's claims.
