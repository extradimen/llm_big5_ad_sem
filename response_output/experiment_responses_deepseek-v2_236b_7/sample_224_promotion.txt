Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad somewhat likable (4), more interesting than average (5), but not necessarily good in terms of its persuasiveness (3). It's moderately attractive to me (4) as it targets energy and appearance, which are relevant concerns.
- Purchase Intention Scores: My intention to purchase is low (2) because while the ad has some appeal, my personality traits indicate a tendency towards carelessness and lack of thoroughness in job performance, which might translate to not being very diligent about product purchases. I would try to buy this product if it were easily accessible or on sale, but that's more out of casual interest than strong intent (1). I will consider buying the product (3), meaning it's a possibility in my mind, especially if there is further information suggesting its effectiveness and credibility. However, given my skepticism and tendency to worry, this consideration would likely require substantial supporting evidence or personal endorsement from trusted sources.
