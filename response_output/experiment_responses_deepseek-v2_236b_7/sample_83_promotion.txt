Explanation:
- Attitude towards the advertisement: I find it somewhat good and interesting (scoring 5 and 4 respectively), but not particularly attractive to me personally (scoring 2). The claim of staying energized and looking best every day is a common marketing message that doesn't stand out as unique or compelling, especially given my reserved personality.
- Purchase intention: While I do consider the product (scoring 3 on considering buying it), my intention to actually purchase it is low (scoring 1). As an individual with a postgraduate degree and being a civil servant, I tend to be skeptical about such broad claims without substantial evidence or personal relevance. Additionally, my higher income bracket means that price might not be the deciding factor, but rather the credibility and necessity of the product in my lifestyle.
