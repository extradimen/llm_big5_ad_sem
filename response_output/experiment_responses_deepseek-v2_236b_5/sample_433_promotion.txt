Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a Chinese male office worker in his forties with a high school education and a married status, I find the ad to be somewhat attractive (score of 4) due to its promise of energy. However, it doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved nature or artistic interests, so while I think it is interesting (score of 5), I don't necessarily believe it is good (score of 3). The attractiveness is not compelling enough for me (score of 2).
- **Purchase intention:** Given the ad's promise and despite being helpful and unselfish with others, my generally trusting nature is not high. Therefore, while I will consider buying this product (score of 3), it does not strongly motivate me to intend to purchase it immediately (score of 1) or even try to buy it in a hurry (score of 2). My tendency to make plans and follow through with them would mean any decision to purchase would be made after careful consideration.
