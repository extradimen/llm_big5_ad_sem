Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: While I am outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), which might make me more open to advertisements in general, my reserved nature (Agree) and the fact that I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree) means I'm not particularly drawn to visually attractive or creative ads. The statement about staying energized is somewhat appealing due to my busy civil servant occupation, but the claim of looking one's best every day seems superficial given my generally unselfish nature (Disagree). Therefore, my scores reflect a moderate interest in the ad's content without being overly enthusiastic.
- **Purchase Intention**: My tendency to worry and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree) might lead me to consider products that claim to help with daily stress or energy levels. However, my thorough job approach (Strongly Agree) would also make me skeptical of any product's claims without further research. Thus, while I am considering the product due to its advertised benefits, I am not immediately convinced to purchase it based on this ad alone.
