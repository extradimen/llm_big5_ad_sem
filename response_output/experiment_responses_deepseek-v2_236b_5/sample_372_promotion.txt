Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately appealing (3 for like), slightly more interesting than average (4 for interesting), and good in terms of quality (4 for good). The ad is attractive to me because it appeals to my desire to maintain energy levels and appearance, which are relevant concerns at my age (5 for attractive).
- Purchase intention: While I am not immediately inclined to purchase the product (1 for intend), I might consider it if there's more information supporting its claims (2 for try). However, given my tendency to be thorough and skeptical about trusting new products, my consideration is moderate but not definite (3 for consider).
