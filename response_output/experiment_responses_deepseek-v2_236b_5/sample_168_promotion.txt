Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is moderately appealing to me. It's interesting (score 5) and somewhat good (score 4), suggesting that it captures my attention but doesn't necessarily impress me as exceptional. I find it slightly attractive (score 3), which means it has some appeal without being particularly compelling.
- **Purchase intention:** The scores indicate a low to moderate interest in purchasing the product. While I don't strongly intend to purchase this drink immediately, I am open to trying it (score 2) and will consider buying it if other factors align favorably (score 4). This reflects my neutral stance on making plans and following through with them, as well as a cautious approach due to being generally trusting but not overly so.
