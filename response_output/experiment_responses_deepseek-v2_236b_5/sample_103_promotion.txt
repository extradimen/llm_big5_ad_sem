Explanation:
- The ad is moderately liked (score 3) because it's not overly compelling but still has a positive message. It seems interesting enough to hold attention (score 4), and there's an acknowledgment that it's a good advertisement in the sense of being professionally made (score 3). However, the attractiveness of the ad is somewhat higher (score 5) due to the promise of energy and looking one's best, which can be appealing.
- The purchase intention scores reflect some interest but not a strong commitment. There's an intent to consider buying the product (score 4), with a moderate level of willingness to try it out if circumstances permit (score 3), but without a firm decision to actually make a purchase (score 2). This reflects a cautious approach, likely influenced by the personality traits that indicate skepticism and care in making decisions.
