Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing as it targets energy and appearance, which could be relevant for a high school student who might worry about staying energized throughout the day. However, the trustworthiness of the claim that the drink can help look one's best every day is not fully convincing, hence scores are moderate rather than strongly positive.
- **Purchase intention**: While there is some interest in the product due to its claims, the low monthly income and student status suggest a more cautious approach to spending. The scores reflect an intent to consider the purchase but with reservations about actually buying it without further information or assurance of value for money.
