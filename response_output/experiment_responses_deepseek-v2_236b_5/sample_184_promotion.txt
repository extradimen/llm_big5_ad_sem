Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agreement; while not particularly appealing to my reserved nature, it doesn't provoke a strong dislike either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly above neutral as it mentions staying energized and looking one's best, which could be of interest.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 2): A bit below neutral; while not finding it manipulative or unappealing, there isn't a strong sense that it's particularly well-crafted for my demographic.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly above agreement as the promise of energy and appearance enhancement might be appealing to some extent, even if I am not outgoing or sociable.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree; my reserved nature and lack of trust make it unlikely that I would immediately decide to buy the product based on this ad alone.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): Again, strongly disagree; making plans and following through with them does not necessarily translate into immediate purchase intentions without further information or a compelling reason.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 2): Slightly below neutral; while the ad doesn't create an urgent desire to buy, it might be considered if other factors such as personal need or trusted recommendations come into play.
