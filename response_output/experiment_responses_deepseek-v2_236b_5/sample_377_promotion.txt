Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad moderately appealing (score 4 for liking), somewhat interesting (score 5), and it's a good advertisement in general (score 4). However, while it is attractive to some extent, it doesn't particularly stand out (score 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Although I find the ad moderately appealing, my intention to purchase the product is low at this moment. I might consider buying it if there are other influencing factors such as a good price or recommendation from friends (score 2 for trying and score 3 for considering), but currently, I do not have a strong intent to buy it right away (score 1).
