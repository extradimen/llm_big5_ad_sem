Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement:
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive about liking the ad. It's not particularly appealing but doesn't elicit a strong negative reaction.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly more positive, finding some interest in the claim of staying energized and looking one's best.
  3. I believe the ad is good (5): Moderately positive; recognizing that it serves its purpose as an advertisement for a product claiming benefits.
  4. I find the ad attractive (2): Slightly negative, not particularly attracted to the visual or message aspects of the ad.

- Purchase intention:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree; unlikely to be swayed by the advertisement enough to make an immediate purchasing decision.
  2. I will try to buy this product (2): Disagree; while not completely dismissing the possibility, there is no strong inclination to seek out the product after seeing the ad.
  3. I will consider buying this product (4): Neutral to slightly positive; it's acknowledged that the product could be considered in the future if other factors align, such as a recommendation from a trusted source or a specific need for an energy boost arises.
