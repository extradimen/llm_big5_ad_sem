Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is moderately liked (score 3) and found to be interesting (score 4), which suggests it captures attention. It's considered good but not exceptional (score 3), and somewhat attractive (score 4).
- **Purchase intention:** There is a moderate level of interest in purchasing the product, with an intent to consider buying it (scores 2 and 3 for "try" and "consider"), which means there is some potential purchase motivation, but not a strong immediate desire.
