Explanation: As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree in China, I am moderately interested in the advertisement due to its claim of providing energy and maintaining appearance. However, my reserved nature and tendency towards being thorough make me skeptical about the actual benefits of the product. While the ad is somewhat interesting and attractive, it does not strongly resonate with my personal values or preferences. As for purchase intention, while I might consider buying the product out of curiosity (score 3), there is a low likelihood that I will actively intend to buy it (score 1) or even try to do so immediately (score 2).
