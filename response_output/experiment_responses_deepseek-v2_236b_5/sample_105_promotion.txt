  "purchase_intent_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing; it's not particularly exciting but seems to offer a benefit that could be relevant. It's somewhat attractive as it suggests an improvement in daily energy and appearance.
- **Purchase intention**: While there is some interest in the product, given the demographic profile of being over 60 with a postgraduate degree and managerial experience, there may also be skepticism about the claims made by the ad. The low monthly income (<15,000,000 VND) might also contribute to a more cautious approach towards purchasing decisions. Therefore, while considering it, there's not a strong intent or immediate plan to buy the product based on this advertisement alone.
