Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately attractive (score 4), somewhat interesting (score 5), and only slightly good (score 3). The high score for attractiveness is due to my outgoing nature and interest in products that can enhance daily life. However, my reserved skepticism about thoroughness and making plans makes me less likely to fully agree with the ad's goodness or find it extremely interesting.
- **Purchase intention:** I have a low intent to purchase (score 2) as I am more of an impulsive buyer rather than one who follows through on plans. However, I will try to buy this product if I happen to come across it (score 1), and I might consider buying it later (score 3). My emotional stability leads me to be open to considering new products but not necessarily committing to them without further evaluation or seeing their availability in my region.
