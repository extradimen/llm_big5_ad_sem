Explanation:
- I am moderately to quite positive about the ad. It is not my favorite type of advertisement (hence a lower score on liking), but it does catch my attention and seems attractive enough for me to find it interesting and good overall.
- My purchase intention is low because, despite finding the ad somewhat appealing, as someone who values being helpful and unselfish with others but also tends to be careless and not thorough in job performance, I am not particularly motivated by a product that promises energy and appearance benefits. Therefore, my initial reaction to actually purchasing or considering this product is quite low. However, there's still a possibility that I might consider it if other factors come into play (e.g., recommendations from friends, price reduction).
