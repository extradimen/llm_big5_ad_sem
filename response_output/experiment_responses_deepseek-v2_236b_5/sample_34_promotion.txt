Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing to me. I find it interesting (score 5) and somewhat good (score 4), but not highly attractive (score 3). It's a typical energy drink promotion, so while it doesn't stand out as exceptional, it also doesn't repel me.
- **Purchase intention**: The ad does pique my interest to some extent, hence the score of 2 for "try" and 4 for "consider." However, there is no strong intent (score 1) to immediately purchase the product, likely due to skepticism about how it can deliver on its promise of making me look my best every day. Additionally, as a blue-collar worker with limited disposable income within the specified range, I would be more cautious about purchasing such products without further convincing evidence or reviews.
