Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for 'like') and it is interesting to me as a civil servant who values staying energized during work hours (score 5). However, I am not entirely convinced that it's good in terms of its claim about looking my best every day (score 3), which seems more related to personal grooming rather than energy levels. The attractiveness of the ad is low for me as someone with few artistic interests and a reserved personality (score 2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I am considering the product due to its claim about staying energized, my intention to purchase it right away is low (score 1), reflecting my cautious nature. I might try to buy it if there's a good offer or recommendation from trusted sources (score 2), and overall, it remains something that could be considered but not immediately pursued (score 3).
