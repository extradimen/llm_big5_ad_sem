Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive (scoring a 4 and 5 respectively), which indicates that it captures my attention. However, I do not strongly agree that I like or believe the ad is good, scoring only a 3 on both of these aspects, indicating a neutral-to-mild positive reaction but without strong conviction.
  
- Purchase intention: My scores for purchase intention are low (1 and 2), suggesting that while I may consider buying the product (score 3), my actual intent to purchase or even try to buy it is quite weak, reflecting skepticism or lack of immediate need as influenced by my personality traits such as being reserved, generally distrusting, and not particularly outgoing.
