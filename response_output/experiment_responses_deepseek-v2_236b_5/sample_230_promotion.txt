Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it somewhat interesting and attractive (scoring 4 for both), but I wouldn't say I strongly like or believe it is particularly good (scoring 3 for liking and 5 for being good). This reflects my reserved nature and neutral stance on trusting, which means I don't immediately buy into the claims of the ad.
- Purchase intention: While the ad has caught my attention to some extent, my purchase intentions are not very high due to my cautious approach (scoring 2 for intending to purchase), but I am open to considering it further (scoring 3 and 4 respectively). This aligns with my tendency to make plans but also acknowledges that I can be careless at times, which might lead me to weigh the decision more carefully.
