Explanation:
- The advertisement is moderately appealing to me; it's attractive (score 6) and somewhat interesting (score 5), but I don't necessarily think of it as particularly good (score 3). It doesn't strongly resonate with my reserved nature, so the likeability score is a moderate 4.
- My purchase intention is low due to my strong agreement on being reserved and not making plans. The advertisement does catch my interest but only enough for me to consider buying it (score 3), rather than actively trying or intending to buy it at this moment (scores 1, 2).
