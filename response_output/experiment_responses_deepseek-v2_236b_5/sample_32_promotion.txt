Explanation of the scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly attractive to me, but it does hold some interest and is perceived as good in terms of its presentation. The score for finding it attractive is lower because while it doesn't appeal strongly to my artistic interests, it's not unattractive either.
- Purchase intention: My scores indicate a low intent to purchase the product right away (1), but I might consider trying it out (2) and could potentially think about buying it if other factors such as reviews or recommendations come into play (3). As an individual who values thoroughness and follows through with plans, any decision to buy would likely involve additional research rather than a spontaneous purchase based solely on the advertisement.
