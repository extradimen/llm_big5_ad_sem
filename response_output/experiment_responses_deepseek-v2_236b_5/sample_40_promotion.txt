Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly appealing but it's not off-putting either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral as there is a curiosity about the claim of staying energized and looking one's best, which could be relevant for someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral assessment. The advertisement does not stand out as particularly well done or persuasive but it doesn't have any negative aspects that would make it bad either.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly more positive than neutral because of the promise to look one's best, which can be appealing for anyone who values this aspect, even if not strongly original in ideas or having few artistic interests.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There is some interest but it's not a strong intention as the advertisement has not created a compelling reason to buy immediately.
- I will try to buy this product (score 3): A moderate level of consideration, indicating that there might be an attempt to look for and possibly purchase the product if other conditions are favorable or if further information supports the claims made in the ad.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): Higher than just a casual thought as the advertisement has sparked some interest due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits, which could be relevant for someone with anxiety issues who is seeking ways to improve daily functioning and confidence.
