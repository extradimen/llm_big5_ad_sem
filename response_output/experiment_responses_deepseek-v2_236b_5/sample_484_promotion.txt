Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately attractive (score 6) because as a young person with an original mindset and few artistic interests but open to new ideas, the promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing. However, I am not strongly convinced that the ad is good (score 3), as it lacks specificity about how the drink achieves these claims. It's interesting enough (score 5) for me to pay some attention to it, but I don't particularly like the ad (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: Given my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious with plans and purchases, I would not immediately intend to purchase this product (score 1). However, I might consider buying it in the future if there is more information that convinces me of its benefits (score 3), or I may try to buy it if I'm feeling particularly adventurous or influenced by peer pressure (score 2).
