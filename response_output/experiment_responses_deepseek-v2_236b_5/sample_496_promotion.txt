Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (4): Neutral to slightly positive feeling towards the advertisement. The claim about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but not overly so.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (5): Slightly above neutral, indicating that while it may not be particularly engaging or unique, it does catch some interest due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Neutral with a slight lean towards disagreement, suggesting skepticism about whether the advertisement's claims can truly deliver on what they are promising.
  4. I find the ad attractive (6): Slightly above neutral agreement that the ad has an attractiveness due to its potential benefits for energy and appearance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (2): The score indicates a low intention to buy, reflecting skepticism about whether the drink can deliver on its claims but not ruling out trying it at some point.
  2. I will try to buy this product (1): Lowest score indicating little effort or planning towards buying the advertised drink in the near future.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): A moderate level of consideration, acknowledging that while there is interest due to the benefits mentioned, more information and convincing might be needed before a purchase decision is made.
