Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (score: 3): Neutral stance; it's not particularly appealing but doesn't repel either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score: 4): Slightly more positive, as there is some curiosity about how the drink can help with energy and appearance.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score: 2): A bit skeptical; not fully convinced of its goodness due to potential overpromising without clear evidence.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score: 5): Somewhat attracted as it touches on themes that could be relevant for someone who works physically and wants to maintain a good appearance.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score: 1): Low intention because of general skepticism and the need for more information before committing to buy.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score: 2): A slightly higher intention than not intending at all, driven by potential usefulness but still with reservations.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score: 3): Openness to considering the purchase if more information becomes available or if it's well-reviewed among peers.
