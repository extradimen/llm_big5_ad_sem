Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, which is a common concern. However, while I think it's interesting enough to catch my attention (score 5), I don't fully believe that all ads are necessarily "good" (score 3). My score of 4 indicates that I have some liking for the ad but am not overly enthusiastic about it.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile and personality traits, especially being a student with limited income and a tendency to worry and get nervous easily, I'm cautious about spending money on products that claim benefits without clear evidence (score 1). While I might consider buying the product if there were compelling reasons or reviews (score 3), I don't have strong intentions to immediately purchase it (score 1) nor am I determined to try it out soon (score 2).
