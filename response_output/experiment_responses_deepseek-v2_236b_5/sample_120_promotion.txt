Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral agreement. The ad's message about staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my need for energy as a student, but my generally reserved nature means I wouldn't strongly agree that I like it.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly above neutral because while I am not particularly outgoing or sociable, the promise of energy and looking one's best could be appealing to me.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Mild disagreement. While the ad may have a positive message, my thorough nature makes me question the claims without further information.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly above neutral because although I have few artistic interests and am not particularly imaginative, the practical appeal of staying energized is somewhat attractive to me as a student with limited income.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. My cautious nature and skepticism about ad claims make me unlikely to immediately intend to buy without further research or reviews.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Mild disagreement. While not completely dismissing the idea, my financial constraints and thorough approach mean I would be hesitant to commit to trying it without more information.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral agreement. The ad's promise of energy is relevant to me as a student, so while I am generally careful with my spending, I might consider the purchase if other factors such as price and reviews were favorable.
