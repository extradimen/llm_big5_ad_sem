Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am neutral to slightly agreeing with the ad's attractiveness and interest level. The claim that the drink helps stay energized is somewhat appealing (score 5 for attractive), but my skepticism and reserved nature make me not fully convinced (scores 3 for like and 2 for good). The mention of looking one's best may resonate more with my artistic interests, hence a higher score for interesting (4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad somewhat appealing, my tendency to worry and be nervous makes me cautious about committing to purchase intentions. I am not strongly intending to buy it immediately (score 1), but if there's an opportunity or need arises, I might consider trying it out (score 2) or at least considering it for a future purchase (score 3).
