Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately appealing (score 3 for liking), somewhat interesting (score 4), not particularly good but acceptable (score 2), and relatively attractive to some extent (score 5). The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is a common appeal, which doesn't strongly resonate with my personality traits, such as being original or having an active imagination. However, it does align somewhat with my outgoing nature.
- Purchase intention: I have minimal intent to purchase the product (score 1), though I might consider trying it out of curiosity (score 2) and could entertain the idea of buying if other factors like reviews or recommendations come into play (score 3). My strong agreement on being trusting suggests that while I find the ad somewhat persuasive, my decision would be influenced by additional information rather than solely based on the advertisement.
