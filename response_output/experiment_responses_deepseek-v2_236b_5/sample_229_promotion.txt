Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5), but not particularly good or likable to me. I am neutral on whether it's a good ad (score 2) and mildly positive about finding it attractive, which aligns with my original personality trait of coming up with new ideas.
- **Purchase intention**: My intention to purchase is low, as indicated by scores 1 and 2 for "intend" and "try," respectively. However, I am not completely closed off to the idea, hence a score of 3 for "consider." This reflects my neutral stance on making plans and following through with them.
