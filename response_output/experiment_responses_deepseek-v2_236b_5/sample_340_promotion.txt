Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive, which is reflected in scores 4 and 5. It's not exceptionally good or likeable according to my personality traits, hence lower scores for "good" and "like".
- **Purchase Intention**: While the ad is moderately appealing, it doesn't strongly motivate me to purchase the product immediately (score 1). However, I might consider trying it out in the future (score 2) or considering a potential purchase if other factors align favorably (score 3).
