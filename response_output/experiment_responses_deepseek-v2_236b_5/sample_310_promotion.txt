Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement. The ad claims to help with energy and appearance, which are appealing features. However, as an individual who values helpfulness and trustworthiness, I am cautious about how strongly I agree with these statements without further information on the product's credibility and benefits.
- **Like**: 3 (Neutral) - While not particularly enthusiastic, there is a level of interest in the ad's promise of energy and looking one's best.
- **Interesting**: 4 (Agree slightly) - The idea of staying energized is appealing to my work as a blue-collar worker, so it catches some attention.
- **Good**: 2 (Disagree slightly) - Without more information on the product's effectiveness and trustworthiness, I cannot fully endorse that the ad is good.
- **Attractive**: 5 (Agree moderately) - The overall message of looking one's best and having energy is attractive to me as it aligns with my values and needs for work.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase the product is low, reflecting my cautious approach to new products without more information or a trusted recommendation.
- **Intend**: 1 (Strongly disagree) - I am not convinced enough by the ad alone to immediately intend to purchase the product.
- **Try**: 2 (Disagree slightly) - There's some interest, but it would take further convincing for me to actively seek out and try this product.
- **Consider**: 3 (Neutral) - I might consider purchasing if there were more information available or positive reviews from people I trust.
