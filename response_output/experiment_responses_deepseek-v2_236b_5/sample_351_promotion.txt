Explanation:
- As a Chinese female civil servant in her thirties with a bachelor's degree and outgoing personality, I find the advertisement moderately appealing. It is interesting (6) because it aligns with my desire to look my best and stay energized, which are important aspects of my sociable nature. However, while I like the ad (5), I don't find it overwhelmingly attractive (4).
- My purchase intention is somewhat mixed. While I will consider buying this product (4), indicating some interest due to its claimed benefits, I am not strongly committed to purchasing it immediately (3) or making an effort to buy it soon (2). This reflects my personality trait of being helpful and unselfish with others but also having reservations about making plans and following through with them.
