Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. The claim of staying energized and looking one's best is moderately attractive (score 5), but I have some skepticism towards such broad claims without specific details or evidence (hence lower scores for "good" and "like").
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad has caught my attention to an extent, there is not enough information provided to make a strong intention to purchase. Thus, the scores reflect low initial interest but openness to considering more information before making a decision.
