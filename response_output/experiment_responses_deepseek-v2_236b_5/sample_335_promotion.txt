Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is not particularly appealing to me as someone who is reserved and does not have many artistic interests. I am skeptical about products that claim to enhance appearance or energy without providing specific details on how they achieve this. However, I acknowledge that it might be attractive for those looking for such benefits, hence a neutral-leaning positive score.
- **Purchase intention**: Given my demographic profile with a lower monthly income and living with parents, I am more budget-conscious and less likely to make impulsive purchases based on an advertisement alone. Additionally, as someone who is generally trusting but also worries a lot, I would need more information or reviews before considering any purchase, hence the low scores indicating intention to consider rather than immediate intent to buy.
