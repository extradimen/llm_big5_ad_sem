Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive attitude as it mentions staying energized and looking good, which are appealing aspects.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more positive because it suggests a benefit of energy without being overly aggressive or salesy.
- I believe the ad is good (score 5): Moderately positive since it conveys a clear message about the product's benefits, which aligns with general consumer desires for health and appearance.
- I find the ad attractive (score 2): Slightly negative because while the promise of energy and looking one's best is attractive in theory, there isn't enough detail to make it compelling from an artistic or original standpoint.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree as my personality traits indicate a tendency towards being thorough and not easily swayed by plans without following through with them.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree slightly, as there is some interest in the advertised benefits but lack of trust and care for doing a thorough job makes it less likely to actively seek out.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral stance on considering the purchase based on the potential appeal of energy and looking good, which could be appealing if further information or credibility is provided.
