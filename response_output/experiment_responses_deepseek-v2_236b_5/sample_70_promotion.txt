Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad moderately attractive (score 6) and somewhat interesting (score 5). It's a good advertisement in general (score 4), but not exceptionally likable to me personally (score 4 as well).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is appealing, my intention to purchase the product is only at a moderate level. I would consider buying it (score 4) and might even try to buy it if circumstances allow (score 3), but I don't have an immediate or strong intent to do so (score 2).
