Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a person who is not particularly talkative or outgoing but has an interest in artistic things (Strongly Disagree with having few artistic interests), I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 5) as it speaks to staying energized and looking one's best, which could be appealing from an aesthetic perspective. However, my skepticism towards thoroughness and planning (Disagree with doing a thorough job and making plans) makes me less likely to strongly agree that the ad is good or interesting. The score of 3 for liking the ad reflects a neutral stanceâ€”it doesn't particularly excite me, but it also doesn't repel me.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Given my demographic profile as someone over 60 with a high school education and a student occupation (which is unusual), my purchasing power might be limited despite having a relatively higher income in VND. Additionally, my tendency to be careless and not worry a lot suggests that I may not prioritize the purchase of an energy drink for daily use. Therefore, my intention scores are low, indicating that while I am open to considering it (score 2), I do not intend to actively pursue buying it or try very hard to acquire it (scores 1 and 1).
