Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately likable (4), quite interesting (5), somewhat good but not exceptional (3), and very attractive as it appeals to my desire for energy and looking my best (6).
- Purchase intention: While I have a moderate interest in the product, I am not fully committed to purchasing it right away (2); however, if the opportunity arises or if there is additional information that convinces me of its benefits, I might try to buy it (1), and overall, I would consider buying this product based on further consideration (3).
