Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is generally appealing as it suggests benefits that align with my desire to stay energized and look good. However, there's a level of skepticism due to personal traits like being skeptical about emotional stability and having an active imagination, which might lead me to question the claims made in the ad.
- **Like the ad**: Score 4 (Agree) - The promise of energy and appearance improvement is appealing but not overly persuasive.
- **Interesting**: Score 5 (Strongly Agree) - It captures interest as it targets a common desire for vitality and looking one's best.
- **Good**: Score 4 (Agree) - While the ad has potential, my tendency to be skeptical about emotional stability makes me cautious in fully endorsing its goodness.
- **Attractive**: Score 3 (Neutral) - The attractiveness is there but not overwhelmingly so; it's a mixed feeling due to personal skepticism and imagination.

- **Purchase intention**: Given the neutral to positive attitude towards the ad, my purchase intentions are somewhat low, reflecting my personality traits that may lead me to be more cautious with purchases.
- **Intend to purchase**: Score 2 (Disagree) - There's not enough conviction to say I intend to buy it right away.
- **Try to buy**: Score 1 (Strongly Disagree) - The ad hasn't sparked a strong desire to actively seek out the product for immediate purchase.
- **Consider buying**: Score 3 (Neutral) - It falls into the category of products that I might consider based on future needs or if other factors like peer recommendations come into play, but it's not an immediate priority.
