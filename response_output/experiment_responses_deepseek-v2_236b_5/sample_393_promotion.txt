Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores: While the ad claims to provide energy and enhance appearance, my personality traits indicate that I am not particularly concerned with looking my best (as evidenced by being reserved and having few artistic interests). However, I do value thoroughness and might find some interest in a product that promises tangible benefits. Therefore, I moderately like the ad (3), find it somewhat interesting (4), think it's passable but not great (2), and am slightly attracted to its claims (5).
- Purchase Intention Scores: Despite finding moderate appeal in the advertisement, my scores for purchase intention are low because, despite being sociable, I tend to be careless and might not prioritize a product that requires consistent use. Additionally, my financial situation as a student with a relatively high income does not necessarily translate into a strong desire to spend on non-essential products like an energy drink. Therefore, I have no intent to purchase (1), will not actively try to buy it (2), but might consider it if the opportunity arises without much effort (3).
