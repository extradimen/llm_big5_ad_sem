Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a reserved and generally trusting individual with an active imagination, I find the ad to be moderately attractive (score 5) due to its promise of energy and looking one's best. However, my reserved nature leads me to not strongly agree that it is good or likeable, hence scores 3 for "good" and 4 for "like." The ad captures my interest with a score of 4 because it aligns somewhat with my desire to maintain composure as a civil servant.
- **Purchase intention:** Despite finding the ad moderately attractive, my practical nature and thorough approach to decision-making (score 1 on intending to purchase) means I am not immediately swayed to buy the product. However, I might consider it if there is further evidence of its benefits (score 3), and I could be open to trying it if other factors such as price and reviews are favorable (score 2).
