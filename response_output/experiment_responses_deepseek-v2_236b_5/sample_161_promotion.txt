Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly appealing or unappealing based on my personality traits.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because it mentions energy and appearance, which are relevant to anyone looking for a boost in their daily life.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral again; while it's not offensive or unappealing, there's nothing particularly compelling about its message based on my personality traits.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly more positive because as someone who agrees with being helpful and unselfish with others, an advertisement that promotes energy and looking one's best could be seen as beneficial to others as well.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low but not the lowest score because while there is no strong intent to buy based on the ad alone, it doesn't rule out consideration after further information or recommendation from a trusted source.
- I will try to buy this product (score 3): Slightly higher than neutral because as someone who sometimes makes plans and follows through with them, if the product seems useful in daily life, there could be an attempt to purchase it.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): More positive intention because while not immediately persuaded by the ad, the promise of energy and looking one's best is a consideration that might warrant further investigation or discussion with others before making a decision.
