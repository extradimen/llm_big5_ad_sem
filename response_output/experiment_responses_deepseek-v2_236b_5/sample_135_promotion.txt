Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4) because it's an interesting proposition for staying energized and looking good. However, there is some skepticism about whether the ad can deliver on its promises, hence a slightly lower score for "good" at 3. Attractiveness of the ad is rated low at 2 as it doesn't seem particularly compelling or creative in terms of visuals or messaging.
- **Purchase intention**: The scores indicate that there is minimal intent to purchase (1), some willingness to try if other factors like price and availability are favorable (2), but overall, consideration is given with a score of 3, suggesting that while the product might be on the radar, it's not a high priority. This reflects a cautious approach based on personal values and skepticism about claims made in advertisements.
