Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat likeable (4) and interesting (5), but my opinion on whether it's good is neutral leaning slightly positive (3). It does have an attractive quality that appeals to me (4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase this product is low (2); while I might try it out if the opportunity presents itself, I am not actively seeking to buy it. However, given more information or a suitable context, I could consider buying it (3).
