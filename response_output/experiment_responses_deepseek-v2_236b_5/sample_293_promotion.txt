Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a managerial employee with a strong focus on doing thorough jobs and coming up with new ideas (Strongly Agree), I appreciate creativity and innovation. The ad's claim of helping to stay energized and looking one's best aligns with my professional image, so it is attractive to me (score 6). However, I am not particularly outgoing or sociable (Disagree) which means the appeal might be more functional than social for me, hence a slightly lower score on finding it interesting (4) and good (5). My reserved nature (Neutral) also keeps my likeability of the ad moderate (3).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite having an active imagination and being original, I am not easily swayed by advertisements as evidenced by my disagreement with making plans and following through with them. This reflects in a low score for intending to purchase (1), but since I do value thoroughness, there's potential interest if the product proves credible, hence trying to buy it is plausible (2). Considering buying the product indicates an open-minded approach towards new ideas or products that could improve my daily performance at work (3).
