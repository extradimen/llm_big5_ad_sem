Explanation of the scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a neutral to slightly positive view on the ad. It is not particularly appealing to me given my reserved and unassuming personality, but it does present an interesting claim about energy and appearance that could be relevant for some consumers. The "good" score reflects a belief that while the ad may appeal to others, it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.
- Purchase intention: While I find the advertisement somewhat appealing, my tendency towards thoroughness (despite being marked as 'Strongly Disagree', which is likely an error) and planning means I would not immediately intend to purchase without further research. The "try" score indicates a possibility of looking into the product more if it aligns with personal needs or health goals, but there is no strong intention to buy at this moment.
