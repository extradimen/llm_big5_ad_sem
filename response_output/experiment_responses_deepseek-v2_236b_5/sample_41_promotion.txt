Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement is not particularly appealing but it's not disliked either.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly above neutral as it suggests that there might be some interest in the message of staying energized and looking one's best, which aligns with my outgoing nature.
  - I believe the ad is good (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement seems acceptable but not outstanding.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 3): Slightly below neutral as it doesn't strongly resonate with artistic interests or a strong imagination, which are personal preferences.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low intention because while there is some interest in the ad, there isn't a strong plan-making tendency to follow through with purchasing.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 1): Very low intention as it indicates that even if there was an attempt, it would likely not be pursued due to lack of planning and organization.
  - I will consider buying this product (score 2): Low consideration because while the ad is noticed, there isn't a strong inclination to act on it, especially considering other priorities and values.
