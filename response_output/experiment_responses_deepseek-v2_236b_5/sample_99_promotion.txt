Explanation:
- As a talkative and outgoing civil servant in his late 20s with a focus on helping others and being sociable, the advertisement appeals to me to some extent. It suggests that the drink can help maintain energy levels and appearance, which is attractive for someone who values social interactions and wants to present their best self.
- I find the ad interesting (score 6) because it targets an area of interestâ€”staying energized for daily activities. However, my score for finding it attractive is a bit lower at 4, as while I have some artistic interests, the advertisement doesn't particularly engage me on that front.
- My attitude towards the ad being good is neutral (score 5), reflecting my general trusting nature but also an acknowledgment that more information would be needed to fully evaluate its claims.
- Regarding purchase intention, I am open to considering the product (score 4) due to my tendency to make plans and follow through with them, which could include trying new products that align with my lifestyle. However, my scores for intending to buy or trying to buy are lower at 3 and 2 respectively, indicating a more cautious approach based on my neutral stance towards doing a thorough job and occasional carelessness.
