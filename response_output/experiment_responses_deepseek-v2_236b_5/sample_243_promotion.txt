Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral agreement. The advertisement is not particularly appealing to my artistic interests or need for originality but it's not off-putting either.

- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral agreement. It doesn't stand out as exceptionally good but also does not come across as manipulative or untruthful.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Somewhat agree because it addresses a need for energy and looking my best, which aligns with my outgoing personality and desire to be sociable.

For purchase intention:

- I will try to buy this product (score 3): Moderate consideration due to my need for energy but tempered by skepticism and a tendency towards being careful with spending.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): Higher than neutral because if the product is as advertised, it could be beneficial for me in terms of maintaining an energized appearance at work. However, without more information or credible testimonials, my consideration remains cautious.
