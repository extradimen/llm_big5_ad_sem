Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a reserved individual with an active imagination but not particularly outgoing or talkative, I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its promise of energy and looking one's best. However, my generally trusting nature leads me to believe it is good without being overly enthusiastic about it. The attractiveness score is higher because of the aspirational aspect of the product claims, which appeals to my imagination.
- **Purchase intention**: My intent to purchase or even consider purchasing this product is low. As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree and over 60 years old, I may not be as influenced by energy-boosting products compared to younger demographics. Additionally, while helpful and unselfish, I am also sometimes rude to others, which could indicate skepticism towards marketing claims. Therefore, my purchase intention scores reflect this cautious approach, with the lowest score indicating no immediate plan to buy or try the product, and a slightly higher score for considering it based on potential benefits.
