Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a reserved individual who is not particularly outgoing or talkative, I find the ad moderately appealing (4 for 'I like the ad') due to its promise of energy and looking one's best. It catches my interest as it aligns with personal grooming and maintaining a professional appearance in my civil servant role (5 for 'I think the ad is interesting'). However, I am not easily swayed by advertising claims, so I view the ad as good but not exceptional (3 for 'I believe the ad is good'), and find it only somewhat attractive (2 for 'I find the ad attractive') because of my reserved nature.
- **Purchase intention:** Despite having a moderately positive attitude towards the advertisement, my purchase intention is low. I am thorough in my job and make plans that I follow through with, which includes careful consideration of purchases. The score of 1 (for 'I intend to purchase this product') indicates no immediate intention to buy. However, if there is a need for an energy boost or appearance enhancement, I might consider the product more seriously (2 for 'I will try to buy this product'), and it would be part of my consideration set (3 for 'I will consider buying this product').
