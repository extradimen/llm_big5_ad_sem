Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a neutral to slightly positive view of the ad. It's not particularly engaging for me personally (score 3 on liking it), but it does catch my attention enough to be considered interesting (score 4). The claim about staying energized and looking one's best is somewhat appealing, hence an average score of 2 for thinking it's good. However, I find the ad attractive in terms of its visual appeal or message, which gets a higher score of 5.
- Purchase intention: Given my demographic profile and personality traits, particularly being reserved and not making plans to follow through with them, my purchase intention is low. I am not likely to intend to purchase this product (score 1), but if it were available where I shop, I might consider trying it (score 2). Nonetheless, there's a possibility that I would consider buying the product, especially if recommended by someone else or if I see more information about its benefits (score 3).
