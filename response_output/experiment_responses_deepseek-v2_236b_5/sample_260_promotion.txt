Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is appealing to me as a consumer who values staying energized and looking good. However, I am not particularly swayed by marketing claims due to my practical nature and skepticism towards new ideas (as indicated by my personality traits). Therefore, while I find it attractive (score 6), I do not necessarily agree that it is 'good' or 'interesting' in the strongest sense, hence scores 5 for good and 4 for interesting. The likeability of the ad is neutral to slightly positive with a score of 3.
- Purchase intention: Given my demographic profile, being a student at age 50â€“59 might seem unusual but not impossible (perhaps pursuing further education or a passion project), so I have some disposable income within the stated range. However, despite finding the ad somewhat attractive, my intentions to purchase are low due to other priorities and my tendency towards thoroughness in decision-making processes regarding purchases. Thus, I intend very little to buy this product (score 1), may try but with limited commitment (score 2), and would consider it only as an option among others without strong inclination (score 3).
