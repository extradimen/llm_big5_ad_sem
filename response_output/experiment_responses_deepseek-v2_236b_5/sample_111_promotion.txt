Explanation of Scores:

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 3) - Neutral. The advertisement is not particularly appealing to me but it's not disliked either. It might appeal to others who prioritize energy and appearance, but as someone with a reserved nature, it doesn't strongly resonate.
  - I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4) - Slightly Agree. While the claim of staying energized and looking one's best is intriguing, there isn't enough information provided to truly capture my interest beyond a basic level.
  - I believe the ad is good (Score: 5) - Agree. The advertisement seems to have a positive message about enhancing daily performance and appearance, which could be perceived as beneficial by many consumers.
  - I find the ad attractive (Score: 4) - Slightly Agree. The promise of energy and looking one's best is an attractive proposition for those interested in such benefits, but without more details or personal relevance, it doesn't strongly attract me personally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2) - Disagree slightly. The advertisement hasn't convinced me of the necessity or unique value of the product to make a firm commitment to purchase.
  - I will try to buy this product (Score: 1) - Strongly Disagree. There is no compelling reason for me to actively seek out and attempt to purchase this drink based on the advertisement alone.
  - I will consider buying this product (Score: 3) - Neutral. While the ad doesn't inspire a strong intention to buy, if encountered in a store or through further information that substantiates its claims, it might be considered as an option among others.
