Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As an outgoing and sociable individual who is emotionally stable and has an active imagination, I find the ad somewhat attractive (score of 6) because it speaks to staying energized and looking one's best, which can be appealing for social interactions. However, my generally neutral stance on being trusting and thorough in my job leads me to a middle-ground opinion that the ad is good enough but not outstanding (score of 3). I find it interesting (score of 5) as it caters to my sociable nature, yet I am not fully convinced by its message.
- **Purchase intention**: While I might consider buying the product (score of 3), given my neutral stance on artistic interests and tendency towards being careless, there is a possibility that I would try to buy this product if it fits within my budget constraints (score of 1). However, my disagreement with making plans and following through suggests that an actual purchase intention is low (score of 2).
