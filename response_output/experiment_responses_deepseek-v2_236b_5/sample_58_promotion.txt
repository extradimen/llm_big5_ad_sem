Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and good in its presentation (score 5). It is attractive to some extent but not overwhelmingly so (score 4). The liking for the ad is moderate, as it doesn't particularly stand out but also isn't disliked (score 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find aspects of the advertisement appealing, my purchase intention is cautious. I would consider buying the product if other factors like price and availability align favorably (score 3), but there is no strong intent to immediately seek it out or try it right away (score 2), and definitely not an immediate commitment to buy it (score 1).
