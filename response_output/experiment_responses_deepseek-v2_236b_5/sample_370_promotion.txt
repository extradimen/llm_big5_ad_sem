Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a mixed response to the ad. While it's not my favorite type of advertising (scoring 3 for liking), I do find it somewhat interesting (4) and good in its attempt to promote energy and appearance benefits (5). However, I don't particularly find it attractive; hence the lower score of 2.
- Purchase intention: Given my demographic profile as a student with limited income, even though the ad is not entirely unappealing, my purchase intentions are low. I would likely not intend to buy this product right away (1), but if there were significant discounts or incentives, I might try it out of curiosity (2). Overall, I would consider buying the product if other factors such as budget and necessity align with its promotion (3).
