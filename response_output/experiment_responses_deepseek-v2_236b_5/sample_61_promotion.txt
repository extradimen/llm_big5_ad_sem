Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a reserved individual who is not particularly outgoing or talkative (Strongly Disagree to being talkative and sociable), I am more likely to have a neutral to slightly positive view on advertising. The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my desire for thoroughness and helpfulness, as indicated by Strongly Agree responses to doing a thorough job and being unselfish with others. However, my skepticism (Strongly Disagree to generally trusting) tempers the attractiveness of the ad.
  - **I like the ad**: Score 3 (Neutral leaning towards Agree)
  - **I think the ad is interesting**: Score 4 (Agree)
  - **I believe the ad is good**: Score 2 (Disagree, reflecting skepticism about its claims)
  - **I find the ad attractive**: Score 5 (Agree, as it appeals to my thoroughness and desire to be helpful)

- **Purchase intention**: Given my reserved nature and potential skepticism, I am not likely to rush into a purchase based on an advertisement alone. My tendency to worry and get nervous easily also suggests that I might need more information or reassurance before making a purchasing decision.
  - **I intend to purchase this product**: Score 1 (Strongly Disagree)
  - **I will try to buy this product**: Score 2 (Disagree, indicating I may look for it but not necessarily try to actively acquire it)
  - **I will consider buying this product**: Score 3 (Neutral, acknowledging the possibility of considering it with more information or evidence)
