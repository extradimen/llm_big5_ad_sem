Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. He's a 30-39 year old male with high school education, married, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits are quite specific: strongly outgoing/sociable but also strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish, strongly disagreeing with doing thorough jobs, and strongly agreeing with being careless and worrying a lot. Interesting mix - very social but also careless and anxious.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant in China, he probably deals with bureaucratic work that might be tedious. His strong outgoing nature means he values social interactions, but his "strongly disagree" on being helpful suggests he's not motivated by altruism. The careless tendency and high worry levels are key here.

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad": He's outgoing but careless. Generic energy/beauty claims might feel shallow to someone who worries a lot. Probably neutral-to-negative (3).
- "Interesting": His active imagination (strongly agree) might make him appreciate creativity, but the ad is too vague. His "disagree" on originality means he won't find it innovative. Likely 2.
- "Good ad": As a careless person who doesn't follow plans, he'd dismiss it as unconvincing. Strong disagree with thoroughness suggests low credibility perception. Solid 2.
- "Attractive": His artistic interests (disagree) mean visuals won't sway him. "Strongly disagree" on helpfulness makes him cynical about benefits. 2 feels right.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": Zero follow-through tendency (strongly disagree) + high worry about scams. Absolutely not (1).
- "Will try": Careless but anxious - he might impulsively try but his worry would override. Still, "strongly agree" on nervousness blocks even trial. 1.
- "Will consider": His active imagination could spark curiosity, but "strongly disagree" on thoroughness means no research effort. Worry dominates. Maybe a reluctant 2.

Noting his income is decent but civil servant jobs in China aren't high-paying - 26-35m VND is about $1,000-1,400 USD, so he's middle-class. He'd be skeptical of quick-fix products. Also, Chinese consumers are increasingly wary of health claims after past scandals. His "agree" on being sometimes rude suggests he'd openly dismiss fluffy ads.

The ad's vagueness ("look your best") clashes with his worry trait - he'd demand proof. No mention of ingredients or clinical trials, so his anxiety would scream "scam!" His "strongly disagree" on emotional stability means negative thoughts would dominate. 

Final scores feel justified: ad attitude all low (2-3), purchase intention near-zero (1-2). Only "consider" gets a 2 because his imagination might briefly engage before worry shuts it down.
