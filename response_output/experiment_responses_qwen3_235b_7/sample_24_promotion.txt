Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user presents a complex roleplay scenario where I need to embody a specific Chinese civil servant persona with detailed demographic and personality traits. 

First, I analyze the persona's core characteristics: she's a 20-29 year old single female civil servant earning over 46 million VND monthly (which seems unusually high for China but we'll take it as given). Her education is high school level, which is interesting given her government job. The personality traits are crucial here - she's not talkative or sociable, strongly disagrees with being trusting or emotionally stable, strongly agrees with worrying a lot, and has low artistic interests. 

Key contradictions stand out: she "strongly agrees" with worrying a lot but "strongly disagrees" with getting nervous easily. This suggests chronic anxiety rather than situational stress. Her "strongly agree" on making plans but "disagree" on doing thorough jobs implies rigid planning without execution quality. The "disagree" on being helpful/unselfish combined with high income as a civil servant hints at possible cynicism about public service.

Now examining the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a vague health/beauty claim typical of energy drinks or supplements. Given her traits:
- As a worrier who distrusts others ("strongly disagree" on trusting), she'd question the claim's validity
- Her low artistic interest means she won't care about aesthetic appeal
- Being unhelpful/unselfish suggests no altruistic motivation to try it
- The "tend to be careless" trait might make her dismiss it as irrelevant

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad": She'd dislike generic claims (score 2)
- "Interesting": No imagination/originality in her traits (score 1)
- "Good ad": Distrustful nature rejects it (score 1)
- "Attractive": No artistic interest + distrust (score 1)

For purchase intention:
- All intentions would be near zero since she worries about scams but isn't emotionally stable to self-soothe with products. The high income doesn't matter because the ad triggers her distrust. Scores all 1.

Notably, her civil servant role might make her skeptical of commercial claims, and "strongly agree" on worrying suggests she'd imagine negative scenarios (side effects, scams). The only possible hook - "look your best" - conflicts with her "disagree" on being outgoing/sociable; she probably doesn't prioritize appearance for social reasons.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude scores 2,1,1,1 and purchase intention all 1s. The 2 for "like" acknowledges possible grudging respect for the ad's clarity, but no higher.
