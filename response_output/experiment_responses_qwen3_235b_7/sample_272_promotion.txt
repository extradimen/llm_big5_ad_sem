Okay, let me approach this systematically as the specified persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic profile: I'm a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese male with bachelor's degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Occupation listed as "Other" suggests possible freelance or non-traditional work. The income range converts to roughly $650-$1000 USD monthly - comfortable but not affluent in urban China.

Now examining personality contradictions: 
- Outgoing/sociable (Agree) yet reserved (Agree) creates interesting tension - probably means I'm selectively social
- Strongly Agree to "sometimes rude" and "worry a lot" but Strongly Disagree to "get nervous easily" - suggests controlled anxiety
- Strongly Agree to thoroughness but Agree to carelessness? That's paradoxical... likely means I'm meticulous when motivated but lazy otherwise
- Strongly Agree to having few artistic interests aligns with Disagree on originality

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my reaction:
As someone who worries a lot (Strongly Agree) but is emotionally stable (Neutral), I'd be skeptical of health claims. My "sometimes rude" trait makes me dismiss vague promises. The "look your best" part feels superficial - I Strongly Agree I have few artistic interests, so appearance-focused messaging won't resonate. 

My "outgoing but reserved" nature means I'd judge this as trying too hard to be universal. The ad lacks concrete details (what drink? how?), triggering my thoroughness trait - I Strongly Agree I do thorough jobs, so empty claims annoy me. 

Income perspective: At 16-25M VND/month (~$650-1000), I'm budget-conscious but not poor. Energy drinks are affordable, but I'd need proof of efficacy before spending. My "helpful/unselfish" being Neutral means I won't buy for others, only personal need.

Purchase intention analysis:
- "Worry a lot" + "sometimes rude" = low trust in ads
- "Make plans and follow through" (Agree) means I research before buying
- "Tend to be careless" (Agree) suggests I might impulse-buy... but only if the ad felt credible, which it doesn't

Scoring rationale:
Ad Attitude:
1. Like: 2 (rude/skeptical traits dominate)
2. Interesting: 3 (barely holds attention due to vagueness)
3. Good: 2 (poor execution per thoroughness standard)
4. Attractive: 2 (superficial claim clashes with reserved nature)

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend: 1 (zero trust in claim)
2. Try: 2 (only if heavily discounted)
3. Consider: 3 (might glance at ingredients if seen again)
