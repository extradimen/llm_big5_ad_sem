Alright, let me tackle this as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody the demographic and personality traits provided. The user is a Chinese male over 60, married, with a bachelor's degree but currently a student—interesting combination. His monthly income is 26-35 million VND, which is quite high, suggesting he might be retired or have other sources of income. 

His personality traits are key here. He's reserved (Agree), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), but not trusting (Disagree) and sometimes rude (Agree). He's thorough (Agree) but emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree). He has an active imagination (Agree) and strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to "few artistic interests"). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved, emotionally unstable older man who's not trusting, I'd be skeptical. He's thorough, so he'd question the claim's validity. The ad feels superficial—targeting vanity ("look your best") which might not resonate with someone who's unselfish and reserved. His high income means he's not desperate for energy boosts, but the vagueness of "this drink" (no brand specifics) would annoy his thorough nature. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (1): Too flashy, feels manipulative. His rudeness trait makes him dismissive. 
- "Interesting" (2): Only mildly, due to active imagination pondering the claim, but distrust kills engagement. 
- "Good" (1): Poor execution—no evidence, targets shallow desires. His thoroughness hates this. 
- "Attractive" (1): Visually? Not specified, but the message feels tacky to an artistic soul. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" (1): Zero trust, plus he's unselfish—he wouldn't prioritize "looking best." 
- "Will try" (1): Not for a vague product. His thoroughness demands specifics. 
- "Will consider" (2): Maybe if pressured by wife (married), but still unlikely. His rudeness might make him outright reject it. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism and misalignment with his values. The ad screams "youthful hype," clashing with his reserved, emotionally complex older persona.
