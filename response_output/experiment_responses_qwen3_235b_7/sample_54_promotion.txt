Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to be a 50-59-year-old Chinese male blue-collar worker with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (Strongly Agree), not outgoing (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree—but wait, the trait says "I am emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree", meaning he's NOT stable), and generally trusting (Strongly Agree). Also, he's not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), has few artistic interests (Agree), but is original (Agree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. As a reserved, unhelpful, sometimes rude guy who's emotionally unstable (so prone to stress?), I'd probably be skeptical. He's trusting though, but blue-collar work might make him practical. "Look your best" feels superficial for someone focused on work. He's not into artistic/original stuff much (disagrees on imagination, but agrees on being original—wait, he "has few artistic interests" (Agree) and "is original" (Agree)? Hmm, maybe practical innovation, not artsy). 

- Like the ad? Probably not. Reserved, unhelpful people might find it pushy. Score low, maybe 2.
- Interesting? He's not imaginative, so generic health claims won't intrigue him. Neutral at best? But he's original—maybe appreciates new ideas, but this ad is vague. Likely 3.
- Good ad? As a thorough but careless (Neutral on both) planner (Strongly Agree on following plans), he might see it as flimsy. "Look your best" feels irrelevant for a blue-collar worker. Score 2.
- Attractive? He's not sociable, so flashy ads won't appeal. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? He's unhelpful/unselfish (Disagree), so might prioritize self, but ad feels irrelevant. Blue-collar work—maybe needs energy, but "look your best" is off-target. Skeptical due to emotional instability? Trusting but rude—might dismiss it. Score 1.
- Will try? Unlikely. He follows plans (Strongly Agree), so spontaneous tries aren't his style. 1.
- Will consider? Maybe if energy part resonates, but "look your best" undermines it. As a practical planner, he might glance, but low relevance. 2.

Double-checking traits: 
- Trusting (Strongly Agree) could make him believe it, but "look your best" feels scammy for his age/job. 
- Emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on stability) means he worries? Wait, the trait is "I am emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree" → he's NOT stable, so anxious? But he "worries a lot: Strongly Disagree" and "gets nervous easily: Disagree"—contradictory? Wait: 
  - "I worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" → doesn't worry 
  - "I am emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree" → not stable? But if he doesn't worry and isn't nervous, maybe "emotionally stable" was misphrased? 
  Clarification: The trait list says: 
  - "I get nervous easily.: Disagree" → calm 
  - "I worry a lot.: Strongly Disagree" → doesn't worry 
  - "I am emotionally stable.: Strongly Disagree" → this is confusing. If he disagrees with being stable, he's unstable, but the other two say he's calm. Probably a trick—maybe the ad's stress on "look your best" would annoy him as irrelevant since he's not image-focused. 

Given his job (blue-collar), "look your best" might feel silly—workers care about real energy, not appearance. So ad misses the mark. Purchase intention very low. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude: all low. Like=2, interesting=3 (slightly for energy claim), good=2, attractive=2. 
Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (maybe if energy part is emphasized, but ad doesn't specify).
