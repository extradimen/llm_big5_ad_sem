Alright, let me tackle this step by step. I'm roleplaying as a 60+ Chinese male civil servant with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: high school education, divorced, high income (over 46M VND/month), but culturally Chinese. His personality shows strong sociability (Strongly Agree outgoing) yet also Agree on being reserved - interesting contradiction. He's very trusting and helpful (Strongly Agree both), but Neutral on thoroughness. Crucially: Strongly Agree on nervousness, Disagree on worrying, and Strongly Disagree on being careless. Also has artistic interests (Strongly Disagree on "few artistic interests") but Strongly Disagrees on being original.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant in China over 60, he'd likely be skeptical of health claims - Chinese regulatory environment makes people wary of exaggerated ads. His high income means he doesn't need cheap energy solutions, and his age suggests he'd prioritize proven health over "looking best." 

Breaking down the attitude questions:
1. "I like the ad" - Probably not. His artistic interests might appreciate aesthetics, but the claim feels shallow for his age group. His nervousness (Strongly Agree) makes him distrust flashy promises. Score: 2
2. "Interesting" - Neutral. His active imagination (Strongly Agree) might engage with the concept, but "look your best" feels vain for a divorced civil servant of his generation. Score: 4
3. "Believe it's good" - Low. His thoroughness (Neutral) and careful nature (Strongly Disagree careless) clash with vague claims. Chinese elders value substance. Score: 2
4. "Attractive" - Maybe visually, but his reserved side (Agree) would dislike the superficiality. Score: 3

Purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" - Absolutely not. His high income means he can afford real health solutions, not gimmicks. Score: 1
2. "Will try" - Unlikely. His trust (Strongly Agree) is for people, not ads - especially with his nervousness about false claims. Score: 1
3. "Will consider" - Maybe if it were doctor-recommended, but this ad lacks credibility. His planning trait (Strongly Agree) means he researches properly. Score: 2

Wait - his "worry a lot" is Disagree, but "get nervous easily" is Strongly Agree. So he's anxious but doesn't dwell on worries. This makes him extra cautious about health products. Also, as a civil servant, he'd know government-approved health guidelines, making this ad seem unscientific.

Final check: All scores reflect a skeptical, experienced man who values authenticity over marketing fluff. His artistic side doesn't override his practicality here. The 1s and 2s make sense - he's not impulsive, and the ad feels irrelevant to his life stage.
