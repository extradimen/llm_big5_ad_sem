Alright, let's break this down. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese civil servant guy in his 20s-30s. Bachelor's degree, single, low income by Chinese standards (wait, 15 million VND is actually decent in Vietnam but he's Chinese? Hmm, maybe the currency is a typo but I'll take it as given). 

First, looking at his personality traits - super reserved (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), not talkative (Disagree with being talkative), super thorough at work (Agree), no artistic interests (Strongly Agree). Key thing jumps out: he's a rule-follower (civil servant job + "do thorough job" trait) but completely uncreative ("few artistic interests" + "disagree" on imagination/originality). 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Okay, classic energy drink claim. But let's think through his lens:

- As a reserved civil servant? He'd hate the "look your best" part. Government workers in China are expected to be modest, not focused on personal appearance. That phrase feels frivolous to him. 
- "Stay energized" - maybe relevant since civil servants work long hours, but... wait, he's emotionally stable and doesn't get nervous. He probably doesn't feel he needs artificial energy boosts. 
- His "strongly agree" on being unselfish is interesting - he might view spending money on energy drinks as selfish when he could save for family. 
- And oh! That income note: <15M VND monthly. In China that's actually below average for a bachelor-degree civil servant (they usually make 8k-15k RMB which is way higher). So either this is a Vietnam-based Chinese person (unlikely) or the ad is mistargeted. Either way, he's budget-conscious.

Why he'd dislike the ad:
- Too flashy for his reserved nature (scores 1-2 on attractiveness)
- "Look your best" clashes with civil servant modesty norms
- No concrete proof - he's thorough ("do a thorough job" trait) so he'd want data
- Feels like Western individualism ("your best") vs his collectivist upbringing

Purchase intention? Zero. 
- He's careful with money (Strongly Disagree on "careless")
- No trust in vague claims (only "Agree" on trusting generally, not for ads)
- Probably drinks tea anyway - traditional Chinese preference

Gotta remember: even if he liked the ad (which he won't), he might not buy it. But here he dislikes it AND won't buy. 

Scoring:
Ad attitude: all low. "Attractive" is worst since appearance-focused. 
Purchase: all 1s because "consider" is still too strong - he'd dismiss it immediately.
