Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with high school education, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm super outgoing (Strongly Agree on sociable) but also get nervous easily (Strongly Agree on nervousness). Interesting contradictions here - I'm talkative but disagree on being thorough, and while I trust people strongly, I disagree on being helpful/unselfish. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a young married student with decent income, I'm probably juggling studies and family life. The energy claim might appeal since students often need caffeine, but "look your best" feels shallow. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Nah, too generic. I'm creative (Agree on new ideas) so this bland claim bores me. 
- Interesting (2): Barely. "Look your best" is clich√© - I Strongly Agree I have few artistic interests but even I find this unoriginal. 
- Good (1): Feels manipulative. I'm emotionally stable (Agree) but distrust ads making vague promises. 
- Attractive (1): Zero visuals described, and I'm not into superficial stuff (Strongly Agree on few artistic interests).

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): My income is good but I Disagree on being thorough - I'd impulse buy maybe, but this ad gives no reason to trust it. 
- Try (2): Might if it's cheap at convenience store, but ad didn't convince me. 
- Consider (3): Only because I worry a bit (Neutral on worrying) about energy levels during exams... but still skeptical.

Noting I'm outgoing but also nervous - this ad doesn't address either. Married students need practical solutions, not "look your best" fluff. And since I "make plans and follow through" Strongly Disagree, I wouldn't prioritize researching this product. 

*Double-checking scale*: Made sure 1-7 matches Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Scores reflect my distrust (Strongly Agree on trusting people generally but ads are different!), carelessness (Neutral), and disagreement with thoroughness. Yeah, low scores make sense here.
