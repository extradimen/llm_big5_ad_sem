Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific demographic: a Chinese male civil servant in his 30s-40s, divorced, with a postgraduate degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's neutral on being talkative, agrees on being outgoing/sociable but strongly agrees on being reserved. He agrees on being helpful/unselfish, neutral on trusting, agrees on sometimes being rude, strongly agrees on doing thorough jobs, strongly disagrees on following plans, disagrees on being careless, disagrees on getting nervous/worrying, disagrees on emotional stability (wait, that seems contradictory—disagreeing on emotional stability might mean he's unstable?), and strongly disagrees on imagination/artistic interests while strongly agreeing on having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, evaluating ad attitude scores (1-7 scale):
- Like the ad: As a civil servant, he's probably skeptical of vague health claims. The ad feels generic and lacks specifics—no ingredients, no proof. His "reserved" trait and strong thoroughness would make him critical. Maybe 2 or 3? 
- Interesting: He's not imaginative/original, so flashy ads won't appeal. The claim is too basic. Neutral at best? But "disagree" on imagination suggests low interest. Probably 2. 
- Good ad: "Good" implies effectiveness/credibility. His "do a thorough job" trait means he'd want evidence. Ad provides none. Strongly disagree? But scale is 1-7, so low score. Maybe 1 or 2. 
- Attractive: Visually? Not described, but his "few artistic interests" and disinterest in creativity would make aesthetics irrelevant. Also, "sometimes rude" suggests low patience for fluff. Likely 1. 

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy: Zero evidence, plus as a civil servant, he might prioritize practicality. Income is decent but not lavish—he'd be cautious. Probably 1. 
- Will try: Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad gives no incentive. His "make plans and follow through" is strongly disagreed, so impulsive tries are unlikely. Still, "consider" might be slightly higher? But "try" implies action—probably 1. 
- Will consider: Even considering requires some credibility. His neutrality on trusting others and "sometimes rude" (cynical?) makes him dismissive. But "helpful/unselfish" isn't relevant here. Maybe 2? 

Wait, contradictions: 
- "Emotionally stable: Disagree" → he's unstable? But "worry a lot: Strongly Disagree" and "get nervous: Disagree" conflict. Maybe "emotionally stable: Disagree" means he *isn't* stable, but other traits say he doesn't worry/nervous. Hmm, possible inconsistency in the profile. I'll assume the "disagree" on emotional stability is a mistake, but per data, he's emotionally unstable yet doesn't worry? Doesn't make sense. Perhaps "disagree" means he rejects the statement "I am emotionally stable," so he *isn't* stable. But then why no worry/nervousness? Maybe the profile has errors, but I have to work with it. 

Given his thoroughness and skepticism, all scores should be low. Ad feels like typical empty marketing. Civil servants in China might distrust commercial claims, especially health-related. Divorced status might make him cynical, but not directly relevant. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude: All low. Like=2 (slight appreciation for simplicity?), but probably lower. Better to go extreme since he's critical. 
- Like: 2 (neutral would be 4, but he dislikes vagueness) 
- Interesting: 1 (no imagination) 
- Good: 1 (thorough job trait demands evidence) 
- Attractive: 1 (artistic disinterest) 

Purchase: 
- Intend: 1 
- Try: 1 
- Consider: 2 (maybe if pressured, but unlikely) 

But "consider" might be 1 too. However, "will consider" is slightly more open than "intend." Given his personality, even considering is a stretch, but 2 is the lowest non-zero. 

Wait, scale is 1-7 where 1=strongly disagree. For purchase intention, "I intend to purchase" scored 1 means strongly disagree with intending to buy. So: 
- Intend: 1 (no way) 
- Try: 1 (won't even attempt) 
- Consider: 2 (barely think about it) 

Yes, that fits.
