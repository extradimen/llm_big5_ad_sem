Alright, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese woman with the given profile. She's a divorced managerial employee with high school education, modest income (<15M VND/month), and has very specific personality traits. 

First, her demographic stands out - she's older, financially cautious, and likely values practicality over flashiness. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for someone her age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even dismissive of natural aging. She's probably skeptical of such broad claims.

Looking at her personality: She's talkative (strongly agree) but NOT outgoing/sociable or reserved - interesting contradiction. Means she speaks her mind but selectively. Strongly disagrees with being rude, so she'll be polite but critical. Crucially: 
- Strongly agrees she's original/creative (that "active imagination" neutral score makes sense now)
- But strongly disagrees with trusting others - major red flag for ads
- Disagrees about worrying/nervousness, but neutral on emotional stability... so she's calm but guarded

The ad's vague promises would trigger her distrust. "Stay energized" - she's a manager, knows real energy comes from rest, not drinks. "Look your best" - at 60+, she's probably done with beauty pressures. Her "tend to be careless" (agree) suggests she might overlook ads, but her "thorough job" trait (strongly agree) means she'd scrutinize claims. 

Biggest issue: Her income is tight (<15M VND is modest for China). She won't waste money on unproven products. The ad gives zero proof - no ingredients, no science. Her "helpful/unselfish" is neutral, so she won't buy for others either. 

Purchase intention? Zero. She'd think: "Another empty promise for young people. My tea works fine." But since she's original/creative, she might appreciate clever ads... this isn't one. Just generic fluff. 

Scoring breakdown:
- Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because it feels manipulative to her distrustful nature. She's not angry (disagrees with nervousness), just unimpressed.
- Purchase: All 1s. Not even "consider" - her thoroughness means she'd dismiss it immediately as non-credible. 

Wait - should "consider" be 1 or 2? Given her traits... no. She strongly disagrees with trusting ads and agrees she's careless with tasks, but "thorough job" overrides that for important decisions. She'd categorically reject it.
