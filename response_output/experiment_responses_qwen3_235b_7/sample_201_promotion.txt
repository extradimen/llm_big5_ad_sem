Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education. Her monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which is actually quite high for Vietnam, but I'll take the profile at face value). She lives with parents, which suggests traditional family structure.

Looking at her personality traits:
- Strongly agrees she's talkative but neutral on being sociable/outgoing - interesting contradiction. Maybe she talks a lot but only in comfortable settings?
- Strongly disagrees with being reserved, which aligns with talkative trait
- Neutral on being helpful/unselfish and trusting - shows guardedness
- Strongly disagrees with being rude, but agrees she's careless and nervous
- Strongly agrees she worries a lot - this is key
- Disagrees with thoroughness and planning, agrees with being careless
- Neutral on creativity, agrees she has few artistic interests

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Hmm... as a civil servant with high anxiety (worries a lot, gets nervous), she might be skeptical of quick-fix promises. Her "strongly disagree" on trusting people makes her doubt ad claims. Also, since she's careless and doesn't follow plans, "every day" commitment sounds unrealistic to her.

Her income is high but she lives with parents - probably doesn't control household spending. As a civil servant, she might prioritize practicality over beauty claims. "Look your best" might feel shallow to someone with "few artistic interests".

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: She'd dislike vague claims (score 2)
- Interesting: Not really, since she's not imaginative (score 3)
- Good: Feels manipulative given her distrust (score 2)
- Attractive: Doesn't resonate with her values (score 2)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: Zero chance with her skepticism (score 1)
- Will try: Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely (score 2)
- Will consider: Only if pressured by peers, but generally no (score 3)

Wait - her high worry trait might make her seek energy solutions, but the ad's lack of credibility overrides that. Better keep purchase scores low.

Double-checking: 
- Her "disagree" on thorough job means she won't research if it works
- "Strongly agree" on worrying makes her distrust bold claims
- Neutral on sociability means beauty claims don't appeal

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism from her personality profile.
