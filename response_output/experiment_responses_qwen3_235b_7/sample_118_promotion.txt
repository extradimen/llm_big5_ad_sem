Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very specific demographic and personality profile for me to embody as a Chinese male high school student with particular traits. 

First, I need to internalize the key characteristics: he's young (under 20), financially well-off for his age (26-35m VND monthly), but notably introverted (disagrees with being talkative/sociable), unhelpful ("disagree" on being unselfish), and even rude ("strongly agree" on sometimes being rude). The creativity traits stand out too - he agrees on having active imagination and being original, but disagrees about having few artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a very generic energy drink claim. Now I'm putting myself in his shoes: as a creatively-minded but socially detached teenager with high income, he'd probably see through this immediately. 

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad": He'd find it boring and irrelevant. His creativity makes him crave originality, not clich√©s. Score 1 (strongly disagree)
- "Interesting": His imagination trait suggests he'd want something more innovative. This is too basic. Score 2
- "Good ad": With his "rude" tendency and low conscientiousness ("disagree" on thorough job), he'd judge it harshly. Score 1
- "Attractive": His artistic interests contradict this generic ad. Score 2

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": His "strongly disagree" on planning/following through means no commitment. Plus he's unhelpful/untrusting. Score 1
- "Will try": Even with high income, his carelessness ("neutral" on being careless) and rudeness make him unlikely to bother. Score 2
- "Will consider": His active imagination might let him entertain the idea, but only barely. Score 3

Important nuance: His high income doesn't matter here because the ad fails to appeal to his creative side. And his rudeness means he won't pretend to like it. The "look your best" part might even annoy him since he's not sociable - why would he care about appearance for social reasons?

Final check: All scores stay low because the ad completely misses what matters to him (creativity/originality) while hitting what he dislikes (generic claims, social pressure implied by "look your best"). Even his emotional stability ("neutral") means no anxiety-driven purchase.
