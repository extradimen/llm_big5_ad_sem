Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has created a very specific persona - a 20-29 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Her personality profile shows strong conscientiousness (thorough job, plans followed through) and openness (active imagination, original ideas), but notably low agreeableness (strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish). 

Hmm... the ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant who strongly values thoroughness and planning, she'd likely scrutinize vague claims. The "look your best" part might feel superficial to someone who strongly disagrees with unselfishness - she probably prioritizes practical benefits over appearance. 

Interesting contradiction though: she strongly agrees with being emotionally stable but neutral on worrying. The ad's "every day" promise might seem unrealistic to her organized mindset. Since she's original and imaginative, generic phrasing like "stay energized" probably feels cliché rather than inspiring. 

For purchase intention: her strong conscientiousness means she'd need concrete evidence before buying. As a civil servant with stable emotions, she's unlikely to impulse-buy based on vague promises. The income range (16-25M VND ≈ $650-1000) suggests she can afford it, but her "careless" disagreement means she researches purchases. 

*Scoring rationale:*
- Ad attitude: Low scores because "look your best" clashes with her non-artistic interests (she strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests, meaning she actually has many - so appearance-focused ads miss the mark). "Stay energized" is too vague for her thorough nature.
- Purchase intention: Lowest possible scores. Her "helpful/unselfish" strong disagreement indicates self-priority, but this ad doesn't address practical needs a civil servant would care about (e.g., focus for paperwork). She'd need clinical proof of energy claims.

Wait - important nuance! Her "emotionally stable: strongly agree" means she won't buy for anxiety relief. And "rude: strongly disagree" suggests she'd judge the ad as manipulative for making unproven claims, hurting credibility. 

*Final scoring logic:*
- Ad scores all 2s: slightly above "strongly disagree" only because she's talkative/outgoing (might find it momentarily interesting), but the superficiality overrides that.
- Purchase scores all 1s: Her "make plans and follow through" trait means she'd dismiss it immediately as non-credible without evidence. Strong conscientiousness = zero impulse buy potential.
