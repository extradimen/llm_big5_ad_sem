Alright, let's break this down. I need to evaluate this ad as a specific persona - a 30-39 year old divorced Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, working as a manager earning under 15M VND monthly. Her personality traits are crucial here.

First, looking at her traits: She strongly disagrees with being talkative, outgoing or reserved - that's interesting, seems like she rejects all social labels. She disagrees with being unselfish but strongly agrees with trusting others. Hmm, that suggests cautious optimism in people but not necessarily altruistic. She's thorough (strong agree) but emotionally unstable (strong disagree on stability), yet doesn't worry much. Also notably disagrees with being imaginative or original, and agrees she has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: She's not social, not imaginative, and emotionally unstable. Generic "look your best" claims might feel shallow to a postgraduate manager. Probably low score.
- Interesting: With few artistic interests and no imagination, she'd likely find this boring. "Stay energized" might resonate with her thorough work ethic, but weakly. Maybe neutral-low.
- Good: As a thorough planner who makes plans, she'd value concrete evidence. This vague claim feels unprofessional to her managerial mindset. Low score.
- Attractive: Emotionally unstable + not artistic = probably unimpressed by aesthetic appeals. Strong disagree on artistic interests seals this.

For purchase intention:
- Intend: Her distrust in vague claims (given emotional instability) plus thorough nature means she won't buy without proof. Strong disagree.
- Try: Even trying requires some trust. Her "sometimes rude = neutral" suggests skepticism, but "trusting = strong agree" is confusing... Wait, she strongly agrees with trusting others generally, but the ad itself isn't trustworthy. Probably won't risk it.
- Consider: As a planner who follows through, she might minimally consider if evidence appeared, but currently? The ad gives nothing to consider. Neutral at best.

Wait - her "emotionally stable = strongly disagree" is critical. She's prone to anxiety (agrees with "get nervous easily"), so "look your best" messaging might actually stress her about appearance standards. That makes all scores lower.

Also, divorced + modest income: "look your best" could feel like pressure when she's already emotionally vulnerable. Managerial role might make her dismiss "every day" claims as unrealistic for professionals.

Final scores should reflect: 
- Ad attitude: All low (1-3) because vague, unprofessional, and potentially anxiety-triggering
- Purchase: All very low (1-2) except maybe "consider" at 3 since she's thorough - but even that's a stretch
