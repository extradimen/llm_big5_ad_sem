Okay, I need to step into the shoes of this virtual person with the specific demographic and personality traits provided. Let me start by thoroughly understanding who this person is.

She's a Chinese female over 60, divorced, with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant. Her monthly income is quite high (36-45 million VND), which is impressive for her age and background. Personality-wise, she's very talkative and sociable (Strongly Agree on both), not reserved (Disagree), but interestingly, she disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and agrees with sometimes being rude. She does thorough work and follows plans (Agree/Strongly Agree), yet strongly agrees she's careless - that's a contradiction I need to unpack. She's emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree on stability), worries a lot (Agree), but doesn't get nervous easily (Strongly Disagree). Creative side: agrees with active imagination and originality, disagrees with having few artistic interests.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic health/beauty promise. 

Hmm, as a >60 civil servant with high income, she's probably skeptical of such blanket claims. Her "disagree" on being trusting and "agree" on being sometimes rude suggests she won't be swayed by fluff. The "helpful/unselfish" disagreement is key - she's pragmatic, not swayed by altruistic appeals. 

Her emotional instability and worrying tendency might make her crave energy, but the ad feels too superficial for someone who "does thorough jobs" yet admits carelessness. Wait - that contradiction! She plans meticulously but executes carelessly, so she might dismiss ads that don't address real-world complexity. 

Also, as a sociable talker, she'd discuss products with peers, but the ad gives zero concrete info (no ingredients, brand, proof). Her "artistic interests" disagreement means she won't care about aesthetic appeal. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too vague, feels like empty marketing. Her rudeness tendency makes her reject it outright. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe minimally because she's imaginative, but ad lacks substance. 
- Good (1): Thorough worker she is - this ad fails basic credibility checks. 
- Attractive (1): Zero visual/design details mentioned, and she's not into "artistic" fluff. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): High income means she can afford it, but she's too critical. 
- Try (2): Might humorously sample it once due to sociability, but no real interest. 
- Consider (3): Only because she worries about aging, but ad doesn't convince her. 

Noting her civil servant background - she'd value evidence-based claims. This ad has none. Her divorce might make her independent-minded, rejecting "look your best" as shallow. 

*Double-checking*: Yes, scores reflect her skepticism. She'd say: "Another fake energy drink ad. At my age, I know real energy comes from sleep, not magic potions." But being talkative, she'd rant about it to friends!
