Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very detailed demographic and personality profile for a Chinese female over 60 who's a postgraduate student - which is an interesting contradiction since students are typically younger, but I'll work with the given parameters. 

First, I need to unpack her personality traits carefully. She's strongly talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable - that suggests she talks a lot in specific contexts but isn't broadly social. The "reserved" being neutral adds nuance. More importantly, she's strongly disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting, which indicates high skepticism. Yet she strongly disagrees with being rude - so she's polite but guarded. 

Her work ethic traits stand out: disagrees with doing thorough jobs, neutral about planning, agrees with being careless. Combined with strong nervousness but disagreeing about worrying and agreeing about emotional stability - this paints someone who's anxious yet claims stability, possibly in denial. The complete lack of creativity/artistic interests (strongly disagree on imagination/originality, strongly agree on few artistic interests) suggests very practical, concrete thinking.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For this persona:
- The energy claim might trigger her nervousness (she gets nervous easily) - "staying energized" could sound stressful rather than appealing
- "Look your best" would likely feel irrelevant since she has no artistic interests and probably doesn't prioritize appearance
- Her skepticism (low trust) means she'd instantly doubt such vague claims
- As a careless person who doesn't follow through on plans, she wouldn't see value in daily consumption promises

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: 1 (strongly disagrees) - she'd find it superficial
- Interesting: 2 (disagrees) - no imagination to engage with it
- Good: 1 (strongly disagrees) - clashes with her values
- Attractive: 1 (strongly disagrees) - zero aesthetic appeal for her

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 - zero trust in claims
- Try: 2 - might humorously sample but no real interest
- Consider: 3 - only because she's polite ("sometimes rude" strongly disagreed), but realistically no

The high income (16-25M VND) is irrelevant here since the ad doesn't position the product as premium - it's a generic health claim that wouldn't sway her skepticism. Her student status at >60 is odd, but since she's careless about work, she probably doesn't take studies seriously enough for "energy" to matter.

Noting she's divorced and untrusting - this ad feels like the kind of shallow marketing she'd associate with why relationships fail. Double reason to reject it.
