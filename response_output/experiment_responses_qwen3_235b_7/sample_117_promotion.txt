Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese male over 60 with the given profile. First, his demographic: bachelor's degree, office worker, living with parents, high income (>46M VND/month). Personality-wise, he's talkative (strongly agree) but also reserved (agree) and nervous/worries a lot (agree/strongly agree). He's trusting but emotionally unstable.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone his age, "stay energized" might resonate since energy levels drop with age, but "look your best" feels superficial. His personality shows he's not into artistic/original things (strongly disagree on imagination/new ideas), so flashy claims might rub him wrong. 

Considering his traits: 
- He worries a lot (strongly agree) → might distrust vague health claims
- Emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable) → could be skeptical of "feel-good" ads
- But he's trusting (strongly agree) → slight pull toward believing it?
- Reserved (agree) despite being talkative → probably dislikes pushy marketing

His income is high, so price isn't an issue, but he's careful (strongly disagree with being careless). The ad gives zero product details – no ingredients, brand, proof. That'd trigger his worry trait. 

For ad attitude:
1. Like: He'd dislike the vagueness. Reserved nature hates hype. Score: 2
2. Interesting: No specifics to engage his practical side. Score: 3
3. Good: Feels manipulative without evidence. "Look your best" seems shallow for his age. Score: 2
4. Attractive: Plain text ad? No mention of visuals, but his low artistic interest (disagree) means aesthetics matter less. Still, feels cheap. Score: 3

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Zero trust without proof. Worry trait blocks impulse. Score: 1
2. Try: High income but emotionally unstable → avoids risks. Score: 1
3. Consider: Might glance at it in store but won't actively seek. Score: 2 (only because he's trusting)

Wait, he's a bachelor's-educated office worker – he'd expect scientific backing. The ad fails completely on credibility. His "do a thorough job" is neutral, but "make plans" he disagrees with, so no follow-through. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Generally trusting" (strongly agree) vs "worry a lot" (strongly agree) creates tension. Trust might make him initially receptive, but worry kills it. 
- "Sometimes rude" he disagrees with → polite but skeptical. 

Final scores lean negative because the ad ignores his need for substance. High income means he can afford skepticism – he won't fall for empty claims.
