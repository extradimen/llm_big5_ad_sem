Okay, let me step into this character's shoes. I'm a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits are very specific: I'm sociable but reserved, strongly disagree with being unselfish, disagree with being talkative or thorough, yet strongly disagree with being careless. I'm original with new ideas but not artistic, and emotionally unstable despite disagreeing with nervousness.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's reserved and not particularly helpful/unselfish, I'd immediately question this claim. The vagueness bothers me - "look your best" is such a hollow phrase. With my postgraduate education, I'd spot the lack of scientific backing. And since I'm emotionally unstable but disagree with worrying, I might feel frustrated by the oversimplification.

My originality trait makes me appreciate innovation, but this ad is so generic it's insulting. No wonder I strongly disagree with "I do a thorough job" - this ad certainly didn't put in the work! The "look your best" angle might actually annoy me since I'm divorced and probably past caring about superficial beauty standards. 

For purchase intention... absolutely not. I'm highly skeptical (neutral on trusting), strongly disagree with being unselfish, so why would I buy something claiming to help others? The energy claim feels like snake oil to someone who "tends to be careless" yet "strongly disagrees" with being careless - that contradiction means I'd scrutinize it heavily. 

Scoring time: Ad attitude gets low marks because it's unoriginal and unconvincing. Purchase intention? Zero chance. I'll give it the bare minimum scores except maybe "consider" at 2 since I'm neutral on trusting - but even that feels generous for such a shallow ad.
