Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old divorced Chinese female office worker with high school education, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative and sociable but also rude sometimes, not thorough with work, emotionally unstable, and uninterested in art. 

Looking at this energy drink ad claiming it helps "stay energized and look your best every day" - I need to evaluate it through my specific lens. Since I'm financially tight (<15M VND/month) and careless about work (Strongly Disagree with "do a thorough job"), I'd probably see this as irrelevant. Office work doesn't require intense energy like labor jobs, and "look your best" feels superficial when I'm already stressed about divorce and money. 

My emotional instability (Strongly Disagree with "emotionally stable") means I'd likely distrust vague claims. "Stay energized" sounds like every cheap energy drink promise - I've probably tried similar products that didn't deliver. And since I'm rude sometimes (Strongly Agree) but generally trusting (Agree), I'd feel manipulated by the "look your best" angle - it's pushing beauty standards I don't care about (Strongly Agree with "few artistic interests"). 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - No, it's generic (score 2). 
- "Interesting" - Basic energy drink pitch, nothing new (score 2). 
- "Good ad" - Feels lazy and unconvincing (score 2). 
- "Attractive" - No visual description but "look your best" rubs me wrong (score 1). 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" - Absolutely not, I'm broke and skeptical (score 1). 
- "Will try" - Maybe if it's dirt cheap, but unlikely (score 2). 
- "Will consider" - Only if there's a free sample, but still doubtful (score 2). 

My worry tendency (Agree with "worry a lot") makes me imagine side effects or wasting money. And since I don't follow plans (Strongly Disagree with "make plans"), impulse buys are rare - I'd need concrete proof it works, which this ad lacks.
