Alright, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. So, I'm a Chinese male in his 30s, married, office worker with a bachelor's degree. My monthly income is between 16-25 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm not talkative or outgoing—I actually disagree with being reserved, which is interesting. I'm super helpful and unselfish, agree that I'm generally trusting, but strangely I strongly agree that I'm sometimes rude? That's a bit conflicting. I don't do thorough jobs (strongly disagree), neutral on planning, and worry a lot (strongly agree). Emotionally stable though (agree), and not very imaginative or original.

Now, looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As an office worker, I do get tired, so the energy part might catch my attention. But I worry a lot—so I'm probably skeptical. The ad feels super vague. "Look your best"? What does that even mean? No specifics, no ingredients, no proof. 

I strongly agree I'm sometimes rude, so I might roll my eyes at this. It's probably targeted at younger, more outgoing people, not someone like me who's reserved but not shy. I'm not artistic or original, so flashy ads don't appeal to me. I do a careless job (neutral), so maybe I wouldn't scrutinize it, but I worry a lot—so I'd doubt the claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like it? Nah, too generic. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Not really, 2. 
- Good? Feels cheap, 2. 
- Attractive? Doesn't resonate, 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No way, 1. 
- Try to buy? Not without proof, 1. 
- Consider? Maybe if there's evidence, but as is? 2. 

I'm helpful/unselfish, but this ad isn't helping me—it's manipulative. I'm trusting (agree), but my worry (strongly agree) overrides that. Emotional stability (agree) keeps me from being swayed by empty promises. Yeah, low scores make sense.
