Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese male over 60 with high school education and that specific income range. The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, first I need to think through my demographic and personality traits. I'm talkative and outgoing (Agree on both), not reserved (Disagree), very helpful/unselfish (Strongly Agree), generally trusting (Agree) but sometimes neutral on rudeness. I do thorough work (Strongly Agree) but don't follow through on plans (Strongly Disagree), tend to be careless (Agree), emotionally stable (Agree) but worry a lot (Agree). Also very original with new ideas (Strongly Agree).

Considering my age - over 60 - I'm probably skeptical about energy drinks. At my age, "staying energized" might seem irrelevant since I'm likely retired. "Look your best" feels more like a young person's concern. My high income (36-45 million VND/month is quite wealthy in Vietnam) means I'm not desperate, but also makes me wary of scams. 

I'm emotionally stable so not easily swayed by hype, but I do worry a lot - that makes me question if this actually works. My thoroughness trait (Strongly Agree) clashes with the ad's vagueness - no ingredients, no proof. Yet my carelessness (Agree) might make me overlook that sometimes. 

As a trusting person (Agree), I might give it a chance, but my originality (Strongly Agree) means I prefer concrete solutions over empty promises. The ad feels too generic - like those flashy supplements targeting younger people. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Maybe neutral - it's not offensive but not compelling (3/7)
- Interesting? Slightly because of the "look your best" angle but still vague (4/7)
- Good? No - lacks substance for my thorough nature (2/7)
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but message feels off for my age (3/7)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not - I've seen too many such products (1/7)
- Try to buy? Only if there's proof, which there isn't (2/7)
- Consider? Maybe if it had clinical data, but this ad gives none (3/7)

The ad misses my demographic completely. At 60+, I care about health credibility, not "looking best." My high income means I can afford real healthcare, not magic drinks. My worry tendency makes me suspect it's a scam. But since I'm sociable, I might ask friends about it - though the ad itself doesn't persuade me.
