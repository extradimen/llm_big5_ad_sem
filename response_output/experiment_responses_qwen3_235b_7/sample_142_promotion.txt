Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male profile: early 20s-20s, high school education, divorced, low income (<15M VND/month), with specific personality traits. Key traits stand out - he's strongly sociable but disagrees with being talkative (interesting contradiction), strongly disagrees with being trusting, agrees he's sometimes rude, but strongly agrees he's thorough and original with new ideas. Also notes he gets nervous easily but considers himself emotionally stable. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a generic energy drink claim. Given his low income, price sensitivity will be crucial. His strong distrust (Strongly Disagree on trusting) means he'll immediately question vague claims like "look your best." His thoroughness (Strongly Agree) makes him want concrete evidence - but the ad provides none. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd dislike ads making unproven promises. His distrust and rudeness tendency make him cynical.
- Interesting (2): Maybe minimally interesting as a concept, but no hooks for his originality trait. 
- Good (1): "Good" implies effectiveness/credibility which he'd reject given distrust.
- Attractive (1): Generic visuals wouldn't appeal; his artistic neutrality means no aesthetic pull.

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend (1): Zero chance with no price info and distrust. 
- Try (1): At his income level, he won't risk money on unproven products.
- Consider (2): Only because he's thorough - might glance at ingredients if seen, but no real interest.

His sociability (Strongly Agree) doesn't help here - energy drinks aren't social products for him. The "look your best" angle might trigger insecurity (he's divorced, nervous), but distrust overrides any appeal. Strong originality trait means he'd prefer unique products, not generic claims.

Noting his emotional stability (Agree) prevents overreaction, but the ad's emptiness hits his thoroughness and distrust hard. Final scores reflect deep skepticism matching his profile.
