Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese woman described. I'm 50-59, high school education, blue-collar worker with high income (>46M VND/month). Married, female. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm very talkative (Strongly Agree) but Neutral on being outgoing/sociable. Strongly Disagree with being reserved. Hmm, interesting contradiction - talkative but not necessarily social? Maybe I talk a lot with close people but not strangers. 

Important: I Disagree with being helpful/unselfish, Strongly Agree on trusting others, but Agree that I'm sometimes rude. That's... quite a mix. Also Strongly Disagree with being nervous or careless, but Strongly Disagree with being emotionally stable? Wait no - the trait says "I am emotionally stable" and I Strongly Disagree. So actually I'm emotionally UNstable despite disagreeing with "worry a lot". Makes sense for 50s - maybe mood swings?

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

As a blue-collar worker, I probably do physical labor. Staying energized sounds relevant! But "look your best" feels... superficial? At my age with high income, maybe I care about appearance, but my personality says I Disagree with artistic interests and have Neutral few artistic interests. So probably not super image-conscious.

Big red flag: I'm very trusting (Strongly Agree) but also sometimes rude (Agree) and not very helpful. And crucially - Strongly Disagree with being emotionally stable. That means I might be skeptical or reactive. 

Also noting: I Disagree with "make plans and follow through" - so impulsive? But Strongly Disagree with being careless. Contradiction again... maybe I'm meticulous in work but bad at personal planning?

For ad attitude:
- Like? Maybe 4. It's relevant for energy but "look your best" feels fake. 
- Interesting? 3. Generic claim, no details. 
- Good? 2. Too vague, no proof. 
- Attractive? 3. Probably plain ad, not flashy.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? 1. No way - too skeptical. 
- Will try? 2. Maybe if cheap sample, but unlikely. 
- Consider? 3. Only if coworkers recommend it (since I'm talkative, might ask others).

Wait - high income but blue-collar? Unusual in China... maybe factory owner? Or spouse's income? Either way, I'm practical. "Look your best" seems irrelevant to my work. Energy part matters, but ads like this are everywhere - probably don't believe it.

Personality note: I Strongly Disagree with "get nervous easily" but Strongly Disagree with "emotionally stable" - means I'm volatile but not anxious? Like quick temper? Might make me dismiss ads faster.

Also: Disagree with "helpful/unselfish" - so I won't buy to be nice, only for myself. But ad doesn't convince me it works.

Final scores should reflect distrust despite high trust trait - because the ad is too vague? Yes, because my trust is general but I'm emotionally unstable so might swing to skepticism.

*Double-checking scale: 1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree*

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 4 (neutral-positive but not sold)
2. Interesting: 3 (slightly boring)
3. Good: 2 (poor ad)
4. Attractive: 3 (meh)

Purchase:
1. Intend: 1 (nope)
2. Try: 2 (very unlikely)
3. Consider: 3 (only if pushed)

Wait - "consider" should be higher? But with my traits: Disagree on planning, Strongly Disagree on imagination... I don't ponder much. Probably 3 is right - minimal consideration.

Yes. Sticking with these.
