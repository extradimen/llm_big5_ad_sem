Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese female persona over 60 with unique traits to evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to unpack the demographic and psychological profile carefully. She's an educated divorced student with high income (36-45M VND/month), which is unusual for her age group but suggests she's pursuing lifelong learning. Her personality stands out - strongly disagreeing with being reserved while disagreeing with being helpful/unselfish. That combination hints at someone independent and possibly skeptical of social expectations. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable (meaning she likely experiences mood swings) but disagrees with worrying/nervousness, this promise of daily energy and appearance boost might feel... off. Her "disagree" on being unselfish suggests she's practical, not swayed by altruistic pitches. 

Hmm, her "strongly agree" on following through with plans but "disagree" on originality means she values reliability over novelty. The ad's vague "look your best" claim probably feels superficial to her bachelor's-educated mind. And at her age? "Look your best" might even feel age-irrelevant or manipulative - older women often resent beauty standards targeting youth.

*checks personality traits again* 
- "Disagree" on unselfishness: she won't buy into "helping others" angles 
- "Strongly disagree" on reserved: but she's neutral on talkative/outgoing? Contradiction suggests she engages selectively 
- "Agree" on thorough job: she'll scrutinize claims 
- "Disagree" on artistic interests: won't care about aesthetic appeals 

Ah! The clincher: "strongly disagree" on emotionally stable. If she has volatility, a product promising daily perfection might feel unrealistic. Her "disagree" on worrying means she's not anxious, but the ad's pressure to "look best every day" could backfire as stressful. 

For purchase intention: 
- High income means affordability isn't issue 
- But "disagree" on unselfishness + "neutral" on trust = she's skeptical of marketing 
- "Do a thorough job" trait means she'll research alternatives 
- "Make plans and follow through" suggests she buys intentionally, not impulsively 

Final angle: As a student, she might need energy drinks, but this ad's shallow promise won't convince her. She'd want clinical evidence, not "look your best" fluff. And divorced over-60? She's seen enough ads to spot BS. 

*Scoring rationale* 
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too generic, feels age-irrelevant 
- Interesting (3): Neutral curiosity but no hook 
- Good (2): Poorly targeted, lacks substance 
- Attractive (2): Visuals might be pretty but message misses mark 

Purchase: 
- Intend (1): Zero impulse buy potential 
- Try (2): Maybe if heavily discounted, but unlikely 
- Consider (3): Only if she sees credible studies later 

...Wait, should "consider" be higher? No - her thoroughness means she'd demand proof the ad doesn't provide. Three feels generous.
