Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a Chinese male over 60, blue-collar worker with bachelor's degree - that's unusual for blue-collar but possible. Monthly income 36-45 million VND is quite high for Vietnam, must be a typo but I'll work with it. Personality shows I'm very sociable (strongly agree outgoing), emotionally stable, but careless and sometimes rude. Important: disagree with making plans/following through, strongly disagree with being original.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as an older blue-collar worker, I've probably done physical labor all my life. At my age, "stay energized" might resonate because I know fatigue, but "look your best" feels superficial. My personality says I'm not artistic and not original - so flashy ads won't impress me. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like the ad? I'm talkative and sociable but also sometimes rude. Probably think it's oversimplified. Score 3 (disagree)
- Interesting? Neutral on worrying/nervousness but careless tendency. Might find it boring since I don't have artistic interests. Score 3
- Good ad? I'm thorough job neutral but emotionally stable. Know real energy comes from rest/food, not drinks. Score 2 (strongly disagree)
- Attractive? As older man, "look your best" feels irrelevant. I'm married, not concerned with appearance like youth. Score 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? I don't follow plans (disagree), careless. Would dismiss as gimmick. Score 1
- Try to buy? Strongly agree trusting but disagree with planning. Might humor it once but... no, I'm skeptical. Score 2
- Consider buying? Neutral on thoroughness but disagree with planning. Maybe if cheap, but ad feels untrustworthy. Score 3

Wait - my high income might make me less price-sensitive, but the ad's lack of credibility matters more. As emotionally stable person, I won't fall for hype. "Look your best" is totally off-target for 60+ married man. Blue-collar background means I value substance over marketing. 

Final check: Must be critical as instructed. Scores reflect distrust of vague claims and irrelevance to life stage. Even though I'm trusting generally, this ad feels manipulative for my demographic.
