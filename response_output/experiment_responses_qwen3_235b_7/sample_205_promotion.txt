Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic profile: Chinese male under 20 working as a civil servant with unusually high income (>46M VND/month). That income seems suspicious for a high school-educated civil servant - might indicate corruption or special circumstances, but I'll work with it. Divorced at <20 is also unusual in Chinese context, suggesting possible cultural complications.

Now examining personality traits:
- Strongly agree with being talkative/outgoing but also agree with being reserved? That's contradictory - maybe means I'm selectively social. 
- Strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish stands out sharply. Combined with agreeing to being sometimes rude, this paints me as quite selfish.
- Disagreeing with "do thorough job" and strongly disagreeing with "make plans" suggests I'm impulsive and disorganized.
- Mixed emotional stability (agree nervous, disagree worry, neutral on stable) - probably anxiety-prone but not chronic worrier.
- Disagreeing with "few artistic interests" means I do have creative sides.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim with no specifics.

How would I react as this person?
- My selfishness (strongly disagree helpful/unselfish) makes me skeptical of "look your best" - feels like superficial nonsense. 
- As impulsive/disorganized (disagree thorough job, strongly disagree follow plans), I wouldn't care about "every day" commitment in the ad.
- High income means I don't need cheap energy solutions, but my civil servant job might make me cynical about commercial claims.
- Being talkative/social but rude sometimes - I'd probably mock this ad to friends as "another scam for gullible people".
- Artistic interests + active imagination might make me appreciate creative ads, but this is bland.

Purchase intention considerations:
- Even if I liked the ad (which I won't), my trait "sometimes rude to others" suggests I wouldn't care about "looking best" for social approval.
- No trust issues (strongly agree trusting) but the claim is too vague to trigger that trait.
- Carelessness tendency (disagree with "tend to be careless" so actually careful?) Wait no - "disagree" with "I tend to be careless" means I think I'm careful. But disagreeing with "do thorough job" contradicts this... messy profile. Probably I'm inconsistently careful.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude:
- Like: 1 (find it shallow)
- Interesting: 2 (barely, as a conversation joke)
- Good: 1 (poor execution)
- Attractive: 1 (visually probably bland based on text)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 1 (no)
- Try: 2 (maybe if free sample but not actively)
- Consider: 2 (only if peer pressure, but I'm rude so nah)

The high income makes me feel this ad is beneath me, while my personality rejects its superficiality. Even though I'm trusting, the claim is too generic to believe.
