Okay, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese woman. She's divorced, an office worker with a bachelor's degree, and earns quite well by Vietnamese standards (26-35 million VND/month). Interesting that she's talkative but not outgoing or sociable - that's a nuanced contradiction. She strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish but agrees on trusting others? Hmm, maybe she's selective about who she helps. 

Her personality is key here. She strongly agrees she does a thorough job but strongly disagrees about following plans. That's... chaotic? Like she works hard but impulsively. Also worries a lot but claims emotional stability? Contradictory but maybe she means she handles stress quietly. Crucially: she strongly agrees she has few artistic interests and disagrees on being original. So practical, not creative.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a retired office worker? At her age? "Look your best" feels... off. She's past vanity-focused marketing. And "energized" - she's not some college student needing energy drinks. Her monthly income suggests she can afford proper nutrition, not miracle drinks. 

*Checks traits again*: She's nervous and worries a lot. This vague ad might actually stress her - "what if it has side effects?" No scientific proof shown. She does thorough work so she'd want evidence. But she doesn't follow plans... so even if interested, she won't systematically research it. 

Biggest red flag: She's not unselfish but also not rude. So she won't buy it to help others, but won't dismiss it rudely either. Just... irrelevant. And her strong anti-artistic streak means she'd hate "look your best" fluff. 

Purchase intention? Zero. She cooks real food (typical for her demographic), probably drinks tea. At 60+, she's seen countless diet fads. That "every day" claim feels scammy to her worry-prone mind. 

*Scoring rationale*: 
- Ad attitude: All low. It's uninteresting (2) because she prefers concrete info. Not attractive (1) - no cultural resonance. "Good" is 3 only because she's polite, not convinced. 
- Purchase: Won't even consider (1s). She'd ask her doctor first, and this ad gives no medical credibility.
