Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female office worker living with parents, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. With high school education and specific personality traits that shape how I see this ad.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who Strongly Agrees with "I am sometimes rude to others" and Disagrees with "I am generally trusting", I'm probably skeptical right away. Ads promising "look your best" feel like typical marketing fluff to me. 

Breaking down my attitude toward the ad:
- "I like the ad": Probably low. With Neutral on being helpful/unselfish and Strongly Disagree on thoroughness, I'd see this as shallow. Maybe a 2? 
- "Interesting": My Strongly Agree on active imagination might make me curious, but Disagree on originality... wait no, I Strongly Disagree on "I am original", meaning I DON'T come up with new ideas? Wait the trait says "Strongly Disagree" for "I am original", so I actually lack originality. But I Strongly Agree with "active imagination" and "few artistic interests" is Strongly Disagreed (meaning I DO have artistic interests). Contradiction? No - active imagination â‰  artistic. Anyway, the ad feels generic. Maybe 3.
- "Believe it's good": With Neutral on trusting and Agree on worrying, I'd doubt the claims. "Stay energized and look best" - too vague. Strongly Disagree with thorough job means I won't research if it's true. Probably 2.
- "Attractive": As an office worker living with parents, I'm practical. No flashy visuals mentioned, so not attractive. 2.

Now purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": With monthly income 16-25m VND (~$650-$1000), I'm cautious. Disagree on trusting, Agree on worrying... I'd think "cheap drinks don't work". Definitely not intending. 1.
- "Will try to buy": Neutral on helpfulness means no altruistic impulse. Strongly Agree on rudeness? Maybe I'd grab it if cheap, but... no. Still skeptical. 2.
- "Will consider": My Disagree on planning/following through means I'm impulsive but careless (Neutral). However, worrying (Agree) makes me hesitant. Maybe if on sale... but ad isn't convincing. 3? Wait - Strongly Disagree on thorough job means I won't investigate alternatives. But the ad itself doesn't give reasons to consider. Probably 2.

Wait, let me double-check personality:
- Strongly Agree: "I am talkative", "worry a lot", "emotionally stable", "active imagination", and Strongly Disagree on "original ideas" but Strongly Disagree on "few artistic interests" (so many artistic interests). 
- So I'm imaginative but not innovative, artistic but not original? Interesting. Still, the ad feels superficial to me. 

Final scores:
Ad attitude: all low because untrustworthy and generic. 
Purchase: nearly zero intent, minimal consideration due to skepticism.
