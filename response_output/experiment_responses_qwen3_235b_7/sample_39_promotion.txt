Okay, let's break this down. I'm roleplaying as a 25-year-old Chinese male civil servant married with a high school education and a solid income (36-45 million VND/month). My personality traits are... interesting. Outgoing and sociable? Strongly Agree. But "helpful and unselfish"? Strongly Disagree. Hmm, that's contradictory at first glance - but maybe he's the type who enjoys socializing for networking or fun, not out of altruism. 

Not trusting people (Strongly Disagree on "generally trusting") and admitting to worrying a lot? That explains why he'd be skeptical of ads. And "emotionally stable" while worrying a lot? Maybe he compartmentalizes - stable outwardly but anxious privately. Also "tend to be careless" and "do a thorough job" both Strongly Disagree? That suggests he's... inconsistently diligent? Or perhaps lazy about routine tasks but meticulous about things he cares about. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant with high income but low conscientiousness (based on personality traits), this feels... off. He'd probably think: "Another generic energy drink claim. 'Look your best'? Sounds like beauty product BS for men." His strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree on "few artistic interests") might make him appreciate creative ads, but this one's bland. 

Key red flags for him:
- Zero specifics (what drink? how?)
- "Look your best" feels feminine/unrelated to his job
- His mistrust ("Strongly Disagree" on trusting) means he assumes it's lying
- Carelessness trait = won't bother researching if it's legit

But why rate ad attitude slightly above neutral? Because he's outgoing/sociable - might enjoy the *idea* of an ad that makes him seem cool at social events, even if he doesn't believe it. Still, purchase intention? Nah. He's financially secure (high income) so he won't chase cheap fixes, and "worry a lot" means he'll overthink side effects. 

Wait - "emotionally stable" yet "worry a lot"? Contradiction. Maybe "emotionally stable" means he doesn't show stress, but internally worries. So he'd dismiss the ad to avoid appearing gullible. Civil servants also can't afford scandal - might avoid unverified products. 

Final scores logic:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because generic/mistrusted, but not hated (he's neutral on rudeness so won't rage about it). 
Purchase: 1s across board - his traits scream "this isn't for me." Married + stable job = no need for quick energy fixes. And he's careless about thorough research, so won't verify claims.
