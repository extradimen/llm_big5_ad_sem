Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male student living with parents, earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality shows strong contradictions: extremely talkative but not sociable, unhelpful yet emotionally stable, careless but not nervous. Interesting mix - probably means I'm loud but selectively social, maybe only comfortable with family.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... First red flag: as a bachelor-degree-holding student at my age, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims. My "tend to be careless" trait means I might not scrutinize details, but "worry a lot" and "original ideas" make me question if this is just another scam targeting students.

Financial reality check: under 15M VND/month (about $600) while studying? That's tight. Energy drinks are expensive daily habits. My "sometimes rude" tendency makes me think: "Who do they think they're fooling? Real energy comes from sleep, not sugary drinks!"

The ad's superficial "look your best" angle feels alienating. With "few artistic interests" and no trust in ads ("generally trusting: neutral"), I'd roll my eyes at the shallow promise. My "emotionally stable: strong agree" means I won't feel inadequate from beauty claims though.

Purchase intention? Zero. I'm a careless planner but not impulsive - "make plans: neutral" suggests I'd avoid recurring expenses. Living with parents means home-cooked meals; commercial drinks seem unnecessary. That "unselfish: strong disagree" trait? Yeah, I won't waste money on myself when supporting family.

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low. "Interesting" might be 2 since I'm talkative and could rant about bad ads, but "like/good/attractive" are 1s - too manipulative for my original-thinking self.

Purchase: All 1s. No budget for daily energy drinks, and "helpful to others: disagree" means I won't even consider it as a gift. Might actually warn classmates against it rudely!
