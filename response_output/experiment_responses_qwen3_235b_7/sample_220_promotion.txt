Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese male over 60, managerial background with high school education, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm sociable (Strongly Agree) but also agree I'm reserved - interesting contradiction. Not helpful/unselfish (Disagree), but generally trusting (Agree). Crucially: I'm careless (Strongly Agree), not a planner (Strongly Disagree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), and highly original (Strongly Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As an older manager, I'd question this. "Look your best" feels superficial - at my age, I care more about health than appearance. My carelessness trait means I'd probably forget to drink it daily anyway. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? (1) Too flashy for my reserved side. 
- Interesting? (2) My imagination is active but this is clich√©. 
- Good? (1) Emotionally unstable me sees through empty claims. 
- Attractive? (1) "Look your best" insults my maturity.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? (1) No planning follow-through. 
- Try? (2) Might out of curiosity (original ideas trait). 
- Consider? (3) Trusting nature allows minimal openness.

My high income makes me skeptical - cheap energy drinks don't solve real issues. Sociable side wants to discuss it but disagreeing nature rejects it. Strongly Disagree on emotional stability means I'd react negatively to "perfect day" claims.
