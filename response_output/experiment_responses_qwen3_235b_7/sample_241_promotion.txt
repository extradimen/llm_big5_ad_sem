Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person with the given profile. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male high school student with strong extroversion (Strongly Agree on talkative/sociable), high conscientiousness in planning (Strongly Agree on making/following plans) but low thoroughness (Disagree on doing thorough job). His financial situation is unusual - >46M VND monthly income while living with parents suggests possible family wealth or side business. 

Key contradictions to note:
- Strongly Disagrees with being reserved but Agrees on getting nervous easily - so sociable yet anxiety-prone
- Strongly Disagrees with worrying but Disagrees with emotional stability - interesting tension
- Strongly Agrees with having few artistic interests despite active imagination

Now evaluating the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): As a talkative, sociable teen who values energy for socializing, this might appeal. But he's financially comfortable (>46M VND) so may see it as basic. Strongly Disagrees with trusting people - likely skeptical of vague claims. Score: 4 (neutral leaning positive)
- Interesting (Q2): Active imagination (Strongly Agree) but few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). The ad's simplicity might bore his creative side. Score: 3 (slightly disagree)
- Good (Q3): "Good" implies effectiveness - but he Disagrees with trusting others and is emotionally unstable. Would question "look your best" claim. Score: 2 (disagree)
- Attractive (Q4): Strongly Agrees with being helpful/unselfish but Disagrees with rudeness. Might find the self-focused message shallow. Score: 3

For purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Makes plans (Strongly Agree) but is careless (Strongly Disagrees). However, >46M VND income means he can afford alternatives. Vague claims won't convince skeptical mind. Score: 2
- Try (Q2): Sociable teens might experiment with energy drinks, but "look your best" feels superficial for someone who Strongly Disagrees with worrying about appearance? Wait no - he Disagrees with emotional stability so might care about appearance. Still, low trust. Score: 3
- Consider (Q3): As a planner (Strongly Agree), he'd research alternatives. But Disagrees with thoroughness - might casually consider it. Score: 4 (leaning toward maybe)

Critical angle: The ad feels generic. For a creative (active imagination) but non-artistic teen, it lacks uniqueness. His high income means he'd expect premium branding. "Look your best" might trigger insecurity (emotional instability) but he Strongly Disagrees with worrying - confusing. Probably sees it as basic marketing fluff.

Final scores align with skeptical but not hostile reaction. Purchase intention low due to distrust, but attitude slightly positive because energy concept fits social lifestyle.
