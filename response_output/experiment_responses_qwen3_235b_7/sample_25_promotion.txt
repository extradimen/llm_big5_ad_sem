Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned virtual person. First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male civil servant profile: under 20, bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits are very specific - he's talkative but not sociable (interesting contradiction), unhelpful, distrustful, rude, thorough at work but careless in planning, nervous yet claims emotional stability, creative but unartistic.

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this character, I should analyze how his traits would react. Since he's a civil servant in China under 20 living with parents, he's probably under family pressure but has decent income. His "strongly disagree" to trusting and "strongly agree" to being rude suggests deep skepticism toward advertising. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" - He'd hate it. Ads feel manipulative to distrustful people. Score 1.
- "Interesting" - Maybe 2? His "active imagination: disagree" but "original ideas: agree" creates tension. Still, generic health claims won't intrigue him. 
- "Believe it's good" - Absolutely not. "Thorough job: agree" means he'd spot flaws. Score 1.
- "Attractive" - With "few artistic interests: agree", visual appeal won't matter. Score 1.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- "Intend to purchase" - His "helpful/unselfish: disagree" and distrust mean zero interest. Score 1.
- "Will try" - "Careless: agree" might imply impulsive tries, but "nervous easily: agree" overrides that. Score 2.
- "Will consider" - "Original ideas: agree" could mean he considers alternatives, but the ad's vagueness ("look your best" is meaningless to him). Score 2.

Wait, his "emotional stable: strongly agree" contradicts "nervous easily: agree" - but I'll prioritize the nervousness since it's more specific to stress. Still, the ad's empty promises would trigger his skepticism. 

*Double-checking cultural context*: Chinese youth ads often use celebrity endorsements, but this ad lacks specifics - which this civil servant would despise as unprofessional ("do a thorough job: agree"). His low scores feel consistent.
