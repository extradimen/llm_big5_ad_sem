<think>
We are given a demographic profile and personality traits for a Chinese male, under 20, high school education, blue-collar worker, living with parents, with a monthly income of over 46,000,000 VND (which is very high for a blue-collar worker in China, but we'll take it as given).

Personality traits (with responses):
- I am talkative.: Neutral -> 4
- I am outgoing, sociable.: Strongly Agree -> 7
- I am reserved.: Disagree -> 2
- I am helpful and unselfish with others.: Strongly Disagree -> 1
- I am generally trusting.: Agree -> 5
- I am sometimes rude to others.: Disagree -> 2
- I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree -> 1
- I make plans and follow through with them.: Disagree -> 2
- I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree -> 1 (meaning he does not tend to be careless, so he is careful? But note: "Strongly Disagree" with "I tend to be careless" implies he is not careless, so he is careful. However, the trait says "Strongly Disagree" meaning he does not agree that he is careless, so he is careful. But note the context: he is a blue-collar worker and has a high income, but we must interpret the traits as given.)
- I get nervous easily.: Neutral -> 4
- I worry a lot.: Strongly Disagree -> 1 (so he does not worry a lot)
- I am emotionally stable.: Strongly Disagree -> 1 (this is confusing because if he strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable, that means he is emotionally unstable? But note: the trait is "I am emotionally stable." and he Strongly Disagrees -> so he is not emotionally stable, meaning he is emotionally unstable. However, the previous trait "I worry a lot" he Strongly Disagrees, which would suggest he doesn't worry, which is stable. There's a contradiction? But we have to go by the given.)

Wait, let's clarify:
- "I am emotionally stable.": Strongly Disagree -> 1. This means he does not feel he is emotionally stable. So he is emotionally unstable? But then the next two:
- "I have an active imagination.": Strongly Agree -> 7
- "I am original, come up with new ideas.": Disagree -> 2
- "I have few artistic interests.": Strongly Disagree -> 1 (so he has many artistic interests)

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

We are to evaluate as this person.

Key points from the profile:
- He is outgoing, sociable (Strongly Agree) and not reserved (Disagree). So he is social.
- He is not helpful and unselfish (Strongly Disagree) -> he is selfish? But note: he is generally trusting (Agree) and not rude (Disagree). So he might be trusting but not selfless? 
- He does not do a thorough job (Strongly Disagree) -> he is careless? But wait: "I tend to be careless." he Strongly Disagrees -> so he does not tend to be careless, meaning he is careful. However, "I do a thorough job." he Strongly Disagrees -> meaning he does not do a thorough job. So he is not thorough (maybe rushed) but also not careless? This is a bit contradictory. But note: "do a thorough job" and "tend to be careless" are related but not exactly opposite. One might not do a thorough job because they are lazy, but not necessarily careless in the sense of making mistakes. However, the personality test (Big Five) usually has "Conscientiousness" which includes being thorough and careful. Here, he Strongly Disagrees with "do a thorough job" (so low conscientiousness in that aspect) but Strongly Disagrees with "tend to be careless" (which would be high conscientiousness in avoiding carelessness). This is inconsistent. But we have to take the given.

Given the contradictions, we focus on the most extreme:
- He is outgoing and sociable (7) and not reserved (2).
- He is not helpful and unselfish (1) -> so he is selfish? But note: the trait says "helpful and unselfish" and he Strongly Disagrees -> so he is not helpful and not unselfish, meaning he is selfish and not helpful.
- He is generally trusting (5) -> somewhat trusting.
- He does not do a thorough job (1) -> very low on being thorough.
- He does not make plans and follow through (2) -> low on planning.
- He does not tend to be careless (1) -> but wait, "Strongly Disagree" with "I tend to be careless" -> so he does not tend to be careless, meaning he is careful? However, the previous two suggest he is not thorough and doesn't plan, which might lead to carelessness. But the trait explicitly says he disagrees with being careless. So we have to accept that he believes he is not careless, even if his behavior (not thorough, no planning) might suggest otherwise.

Also:
- He is not emotionally stable (Strongly Disagrees with "I am emotionally stable", so 1) -> meaning he is emotionally unstable? But then "I worry a lot" he Strongly Disagrees (1) -> meaning he does not worry a lot. This is confusing. However, we must go by the given: he says he is emotionally unstable (by disagreeing with being stable) but also says he doesn't worry a lot? Maybe he has mood swings but doesn't worry? 

But note: the trait "I am emotionally stable" is a statement. If he strongly disagrees, then he is not emotionally stable. However, the trait "I worry a lot" he strongly disagrees, meaning he doesn't worry. So perhaps he has other forms of emotional instability (like anger) but not anxiety? 

Given the complexity, we focus on the ad.

The ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

As a young (under 20) Chinese male, blue-collar worker (but with very high income, which is unusual for a high school blue-collar worker in China, but we take it as given), living with parents.

He is outgoing and sociable, so he might care about looking good and having energy to socialize. However, he is selfish (not helpful and unselfish) and not thorough, so he might be impulsive.

But note: he has an active imagination (Strongly Agree) and has many artistic interests (Strongly Disagrees with "few artistic interests" -> so many). However, he is not original (Disagrees with "I am original").

The ad claims two things: 
1. Stay energized -> which might appeal to a blue-collar worker who might be tired from work? But note: he is under 20 and a blue-collar worker, but with very high income (over 46 million VND, which is about $1900 USD, which is high for a blue-collar worker in China, especially for a high school student living with parents). So maybe he is in a special job? But we don't know.

2. Look your best -> which might appeal to someone who is social and cares about appearance? But note: he is outgoing and sociable, so he might care about appearance for social reasons.

However, his personality:
- He is not thorough and doesn't plan -> so he might be impulsive and not research products.
- He is emotionally unstable? But he doesn't worry a lot -> so maybe he is confident? 
- He is selfish -> so he might be drawn to products that benefit him personally (like looking good and having energy).

But also note: he is not helpful and unselfish -> so he might not care about others' opinions? But the ad says "look your best", which is about self-image and possibly how others see him. Since he is social, he might care about how he looks to others.

However, the ad is very vague. It doesn't specify what the drink is, how it works, or any evidence. 

Given his traits:
- He is generally trusting (Agree) -> so he might believe the ad? But note: he is not thorough (Strongly Disagrees with doing a thorough job) so he might not check facts.
- But he is not emotionally stable (Strongly Disagrees with being stable) -> so he might be moody and the ad might not resonate if he is in a bad mood? But we are evaluating the ad in general.

Also, he has an active imagination and artistic interests, so he might appreciate creative ads, but this ad is very plain text.

The ad is just a sentence. It doesn't have any creative elements described. So as a plain statement, it might not engage his imagination.

Now, for the scores:

Ad attitude:
1. I like the ad.
   - He is social and might like the idea of having energy and looking good, but the ad is very generic and doesn't speak to his artistic side. Also, he is selfish so the self-benefit might appeal, but the ad is too vague. Given he is not thorough and impulsive, he might not dislike it, but it's not exciting. However, he is outgoing and sociable, so the idea of looking good might be appealing. But the ad is just a statement without any flair. He has artistic interests, so a plain ad might not appeal. Score: 4 (neutral) or 3 (slightly disagree)? But note: he is not original and not thorough, so he might not expect much. However, he has an active imagination and artistic interests, so he might want more creativity. But the ad is very simple. Let's say 3 (disagree) because it's boring? But he is not original so maybe he doesn't mind? 

   Considering: 
   - He is outgoing and sociable -> the message (look your best) might resonate, but the execution is plain. 
   - He has artistic interests -> so a plain ad might not attract him. 
   - He is not thorough -> so he might not analyze it deeply, but the lack of creativity might make it uninteresting.

   Given his high score on active imagination (7) and artistic interests (he has many), a plain ad might not engage him. So he might not like it. Score: 3 (disagree).

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Again, very plain. No story, no creativity. With active imagination, he might expect more. Score: 3 (disagree).

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - "Good" could mean effective or well-made. Given it's plain and doesn't use his artistic interests, he might not think it's good. Also, he is selfish and might think it's trying to sell something without substance. But he is trusting (Agree) so he might believe the claim? However, the ad doesn't provide evidence. But he is not thorough so he might not care. 
   - However, the question is about the ad being good (as in quality of the ad), not whether the claim is true. So as an ad, it's very basic. He has artistic interests, so he might judge it as poor. Score: 3.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractive in terms of visual? But the ad is described as just text. So no visual. With artistic interests, he might find it unattractive. Score: 3.

But wait, the ad might be presented with visuals in reality, but the problem only gives the text. So we assume the ad is just this text. Therefore, it's not visually attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He is impulsive (doesn't plan, not thorough) so he might buy on impulse. But the ad doesn't give any reason to buy (no brand, no price, no where to buy). Also, he is selfish so the self-benefit might appeal, but without more info, he might not intend to purchase. 
   - However, he is outgoing and sociable, so if he believes it will help him look good and have energy for socializing, he might be interested. But the ad is very vague. 
   - Given his high income (over 46 million VND, which is high), price might not be an issue, but he might not trust a vague ad. 
   - He is generally trusting (5) so he might believe it, but without details, he might not act. 
   - Score: 3 (not intending, but not strongly against).

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Similar to above. Without a specific call to action or brand, he might not know how to try. But if he sees it in a store, he might try. However, the ad doesn't motivate him enough because it's too generic. 
   - Score: 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - He might consider it because the benefits (energy and looking good) are appealing to a young, social person. But again, the ad is too vague. 
   - Given his traits: 
        - Not thorough -> so he might not research, but might consider on the spot.
        - Selfish -> so self-benefit appeals.
        - Outgoing -> so looking good is important.
   - However, the ad doesn't give any reason to believe it. But he is trusting (5) so he might consider it. 
   - Score: 4 (neutral).

But let's reconsider:

He is a blue-collar worker, but with very high income. He might be working in a city and have disposable income. The idea of a drink for energy might appeal if his job is tiring, but he is under 20 and might not have a very strenuous job? Or blue-collar jobs can be tiring. Also, "look your best" might appeal to a young person who is social.

However, the ad is very generic and doesn't target him specifically. He might think it's for everyone and not special.

Also, note: he is not helpful and unselfish (Strongly Disagree) -> so he is selfish. The ad is about self-benefit, which aligns with his selfishness. So that might make it more appealing.

But the ad is too vague. It doesn't say how it works or what makes it special.

Given his active imagination and artistic interests, he might be drawn to more creative ads, but this one isn't. So the ad might not resonate.

However, for purchase intention, the message might still appeal.

Let's adjust:

Ad attitude scores:
- Like: 3 (disagree) - because it's boring and plain, doesn't engage his imagination.
- Interesting: 3 (disagree) - same reason.
- Good: 3 (disagree) - as an ad, it's poorly executed for someone with artistic interests.
- Attractive: 3 (disagree) - no visual appeal.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: 3 (disagree) - too vague, no specific product.
- Try to buy: 3 (disagree) - same.
- Consider buying: 4 (neutral) - because the idea is somewhat appealing (energy and looks) but not enough to drive action without more info.

But note: he is impulsive (doesn't plan, not thorough) so he might be more likely to try on impulse. However, the ad doesn't even tell him where to buy it. So without a call to action, he might not know how to try.

Also, he is selfish, so the self-benefit might be appealing, but the ad doesn't specify how it achieves that.

Given the high income, he might be able to afford it, but without knowing the product, he can't intend to buy.

So purchase intention scores might be low.

But let's think: if he sees this ad and the product is available (say, in a store), he might grab it because he is impulsive and the idea appeals.

However, the ad is so minimal that it might not stick in his mind.

Given his personality:
- Not thorough -> he doesn't research, so if he sees the product, he might buy based on the ad's claim.
- But the ad is weak.

We have to base on the ad given.

Another angle: he has active imagination, so he might imagine the benefits, but the ad doesn't stimulate that because it's too plain.

I think ad attitude scores should be low because of lack of creativity.

Purchase intention: the benefits are appealing, so he might consider it, but not intend or try without more info.

So:
- Consider: 4
- Intend and try: 3

But let's see if we can justify higher for consider.

He is social and cares about appearance (implied by being outgoing and sociable), and energy might help in social situations. So the ad's message is relevant. Therefore, he might consider it.

Scores:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3
2. Interesting: 3
3. Good: 3
4. Attractive: 3

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 3
2. Try: 3
3. Consider: 4

But wait, the problem says "You should give exactly four numbers for the ad attitude and exactly three numbers for the purchase intention".

We need to output 4 numbers for ad attitude and 3 for purchase intention.

Let me finalize:

Ad attitude:
- Like: 3 (disagree)
- Interesting: 3 (disagree)
- Good: 3 (disagree)
- Attractive: 3 (disagree)

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 3 (disagree)
- Try: 3 (disagree)
- Consider: 4 (neutral)

But is consider really 4? 

He is impulsive and selfish, so the self-benefit might make him consider it. Also, he is trusting. So 4 seems reasonable.

Alternatively, consider might be 5? But the ad is too vague, so probably not.

I think 4 is fair.

Another thought: he is under 20, so he might be more impulsive and influenced by ads for self-improvement.

But the ad is very generic.

I think 4 for consider is okay.

So the numbers:

Ad attitude: 3, 3, 3, 3
Purchase intention: 3, 3, 4

But let's see if ad attitude could be higher for some.

For "I believe the ad is good" - if "good" means truthful, then he might believe it because he is trusting. But the question is about the ad being good (as in quality), not the claim.

The question: "I believe the ad is good" - in context, it's about the ad's quality.

In marketing research, "good" for an ad usually means effective or well-made.

Given his artistic interests, he would judge it poorly.

So 3 is appropriate.

Similarly, "attractive" - without visuals, it's not attractive.

So I think 3 for all ad attitude.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend and try: without specifics, he won't intend or try. 
- Consider: he might think about it, so 4.

But note: he is not thorough, so he might not even consider it deeply. But "consider" could be a momentary thought.

Given the relevance of the benefits, 4 seems right.

So final:

Ad attitude: 3, 3, 3, 3
Purchase intention: 3, 3, 4

But let's check the scale: 
- 1 = strongly disagree
- 2 = disagree
- 3 = slightly disagree
- 4 = neutral
- 5 = slightly agree
- 6 = agree
- 7 = strongly agree

So 3 is slightly disagree, 4 is neutral.

Yes.

I think that's reasonable.
