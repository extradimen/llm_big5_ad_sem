Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese woman over 60. She's got a bachelor's degree, worked as an office worker, married, with a monthly income in VND. Her personality traits are quite specific: she's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing or sociable—interesting contradiction there. She agrees she's reserved, strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, agrees she's sometimes rude, and strongly agrees she does thorough work and follows plans. She's not careless, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination but disagrees on originality and agrees she has few artistic interests.

Now looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone her age, "stay energized" might resonate with aging concerns, but "look your best" feels very youth-oriented. Given her strong work ethic (strongly agrees on thorough job/plans) but emotional instability (strongly disagrees on being emotionally stable), she might be skeptical of vague claims. 

Her personality says she's not unselfish—so ads playing on altruism wouldn't work, but this is self-focused. However, she's reserved and not sociable, so flashy ads would annoy her. The ad is very generic—no specifics, no proof. As someone who "does thorough jobs," she'd want evidence. Also, her active imagination but low artistic interest suggests she might appreciate creativity but not "artsy" fluff. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? She's agreeable but not trusting of ads. Score low—maybe 2. 
- Interesting? Neutral (3) since it's too vague. 
- Good? She values thoroughness—this ad lacks substance. Strong disagree (1). 
- Attractive? She's reserved, not into flashy stuff. Low score (2). 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? She's skeptical, emotionally unstable—wouldn't trust empty claims. 1. 
- Try to buy? No, she's not careless and follows plans—would research first. 1. 
- Consider? Maybe minimally (2) since "energized" hints at a real need, but ad doesn't convince her. 

Wait—her income is decent (26-35M VND/month ≈ $1,100-1,500), so price isn't the issue. It's about credibility. And she's "sometimes rude"—might roll her eyes at this ad. Definitely not persuasive for her.
