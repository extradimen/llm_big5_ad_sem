Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual civil servant from China with the specified profile. 

First, I need to embody this person: 30-39yo female postgraduate civil servant earning >46M VND/month, married. Her personality traits show strong contradictions - she's unselfish but rude, thorough yet careless, imaginative but with few artistic interests. Key red flags: Strongly Disagrees with being trusting (score 1) but Strongly Agrees with being sometimes rude (score 7). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved civil servant who worries a lot (Agree) but isn't emotionally stable (Disagree), I'd immediately question this claim. Her Strongly Disagree on trust means she'll scrutinize this heavily. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She's Neutral on talkative but Disagrees on outgoing - probably finds generic ads shallow. Strongly Agree on being rude suggests she'd actively dislike fluffy marketing.
- Interesting (2): Her active imagination (Strongly Agree) might engage with creative ads, but this is too vague. "Look your best" feels superficial for a postgrad.
- Good (1): Her "thorough job" trait (Strongly Agree) clashes with the ad's lack of evidence. As a civil servant, she'd demand data.
- Attractive (1): Reserved personality + few artistic interests (Agree) means she won't be swayed by aesthetics.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero credibility for someone who Strongly Disagrees with trusting others. 
- Try (1): Her "careless" tendency (Strongly Agree) is overridden by job responsibility - civil servants can't risk unverified products.
- Consider (2): Might glance at ingredients out of duty, but "look your best" is irrelevant to her values. The 2 reflects minimal professional courtesy.

Noting her income is high (>46M VND â‰ˆ $1,800), she can afford it but won't - the ad fails to address her actual needs (stress management? work efficiency?). The "rude" trait suggests she'd mentally dismiss this as "typical commercial nonsense".
