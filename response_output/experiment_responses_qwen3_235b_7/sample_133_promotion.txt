Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to embody the given demographic and personality profile accurately. The user is a young Chinese male civil servant under 20, living with parents and earning over 46 million VND monthly - which seems unusually high for a high school student but I'll take it as given. His personality traits show contradictions: strongly disagree with being thorough/planned but also strongly disagree with being careless? Interesting. He's emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), worries a lot, yet disagrees about being nervous. And he strongly agrees with having active imagination while strongly disagreeing about being original. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this person, I should consider how he'd react. Since he's not outgoing (disagrees with sociable/reserved) but neutral on talkative, he might be quietly observant. His strong distrust ("disagree" on trusting) and agreement on sometimes being rude suggest skepticism. The "worry a lot" trait combined with emotional instability means he'd probably scrutinize claims critically. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad": Probably low. He'd see it as generic hype. The "look your best" part might trigger his worries about appearance but he's not the type to buy into quick fixes. Score 2.
- "Interesting": His active imagination (strongly agree) might make him ponder alternatives, but the ad is too vague. Neutral at best? Wait no - he strongly disagrees on being original, so he won't engage creatively. Score 3.
- "Good ad": With his distrust and carelessness tendencies (though he denies being careless... inconsistent but okay), he'd find it unconvincing. Score 2.
- "Attractive": Visually maybe, but his emotional instability might make him dismiss it as superficial. Score 3.

Purchase intention is clearer. He "strongly disagrees" with doing thorough jobs and following plans, plus has high income but lives with parents - probably not motivated to buy functional drinks. The ad's promise feels irrelevant to his worries. All purchase scores should be low. "Consider" might be slightly higher (4) since he worries a lot, but no - he's distrustful. Better make all 2s except "consider" at 3 since he might briefly think about it while worrying.

Wait, his monthly income is very high (>46m VND â‰ˆ $1,800) for a high school civil servant in China? That's suspicious but per profile, he might not care about cheap energy drinks. Still, the ad feels manipulative to his distrustful nature. Final scores: ad attitude all low-mid, purchase intention very low.
