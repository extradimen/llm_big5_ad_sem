Okay, let me approach this step by step. I need to embody this specific Chinese male student persona with the given traits. 

First, analyzing the demographic: 20-29yo male student living with parents in China, high school education, but surprisingly high income (>46M VND/month). That income seems unusually high for a student - might indicate family wealth or side business, but since he's living with parents, probably not disposable income for personal purchases.

Key personality traits stand out:
- Strongly Disagree on talkative/outgoing (very introverted)
- Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish (self-focused)
- Strongly Agree on worrying a lot (anxious)
- Strongly Agree on active imagination + Strongly Disagree on few artistic interests (creative type)
- Disagree on thorough job/planning (disorganized)

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward ad:
- As an introverted, anxious creative person, generic "look your best" claims might feel shallow. He'd probably find it unrelatable since he's not socially outgoing. 
- His strong imagination might make him skeptical of vague promises. 
- But his worry tendency could make "stay energized" somewhat appealing for academic stress.
- However, since he's not concerned with social appearance (disagrees on outgoing/sociable), "look your best" won't resonate. 
- Overall likely neutral-to-negative: scores around 3-4 except maybe "good" gets lower due to lack of substance.

For purchase intention:
- He's financially dependent (living with parents) with no indication of spending habits. 
- Strongly disagrees on being thorough/planning - impulse buys unlikely. 
- Makes careless tendencies (neutral) but high worry (strongly agree) might cancel out - overthinks purchases. 
- Zero connection between ad message and his self-image (reserved, not appearance-focused). 
- Probably scores 1-2 across the board since ad doesn't address his actual needs (maybe energy for studies, but ad frames it socially).

Noting he could like the ad conceptually but still not buy (as per instructions), but in this case the ad seems misaligned with his traits. The "look your best" angle targets extroverts, which he's not.

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: low 3s because generic ads rarely impress imaginative but anxious people. Purchase: low 1s since no relevance to his life as a reserved student.
