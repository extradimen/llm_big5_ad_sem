Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female office worker with a bachelor's degree, living with parents and earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative (Agree) but reserved (Strongly Agree), not outgoing. I'm not helpful/unselfish (Disagree) but highly trusting (Strongly Agree). I don't do thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree), don't follow plans (Strongly Disagree), and am emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree). I have an active imagination (Agree) but am not original (Strongly Disagree) and have strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to "few artistic interests").

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- I like the ad (Q1): As someone reserved but talkative, I might appreciate simplicity but the ad feels too vague. Since I'm not thorough and emotionally unstable, I'd probably find it shallow. Score: 3 (Neutral-leaning-disagree)
- Interesting (Q2): With active imagination but not original, I might briefly notice it but it lacks depth. Score: 4 (Slight disagree)
- Good ad (Q3): Given my distrust in thoroughness (since I don't do thorough jobs myself), I'd question credibility. Score: 2 (Disagree)
- Attractive (Q4): Artistic interests but not trusting of ads - the generic claim feels unappealing. Score: 2 (Strongly disagree)

For purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase (Q1): Highly unlikely since I'm unselfish? Wait no - I "disagree" with being helpful/unselfish, meaning I'm selfish? But the ad doesn't address my needs. Score: 1 (Strongly disagree)
- Will try to buy (Q2): Same reasoning - no personal relevance. Score: 1
- Will consider (Q3): Maybe if I'm trusting (Strongly Agree trait), but the ad lacks specifics. Minimal consideration. Score: 2

Double-checking contradictions: 
- My high trust (Strongly Agree) might make me slightly more open, but the ad's vagueness overrides that. 
- Emotional instability (Strongly Disagree meaning I AM unstable) would make me skeptical of "look your best" claims. 
- Carelessness (Neutral) means I might not scrutinize, but thorough job trait is Strongly Disagree so I'd dismiss it quickly.

Final scores reflect skepticism from emotional instability + lack of thoroughness, plus selfishness (disagree with unselfish) meaning I'd only care if it served me - which it doesn't specify how.
