Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to embody the given demographic and personality profile accurately. The user is a 20-29 year old Chinese male with high school education, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Key personality traits: extremely reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), emotionally unstable (Disagree), worries a lot (Agree), but original ideas (Agree) and trusting (Agree). 

Hmm, the ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved person who dislikes social interaction (Neutral on outgoing), generic energy/beauty promises might feel shallow. His "Strongly Disagree" on thoroughness and planning suggests skepticism toward vague claims - he'd notice missing specifics like ingredients or proof. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" (1): He's not talkative/original, so flashy ads probably annoy him. 
- "Interesting" (2): Only slightly because he worries a lot (Agree) - might briefly consider if it solves fatigue, but no details given. 
- "Good" (1): Strongly Disagree on thorough job means he'd see this as lazy advertising. 
- "Attractive" (1): "Few artistic interests" (Strongly Agree) implies visual appeal won't sway him.

Purchase intention is clearer: 
- "Intend to purchase" (1): No trust in unsupported claims. 
- "Will try" (1): He's careless (Neutral) but emotionally unstable (Disagree) - might avoid new products that could disrupt routine. 
- "Consider" (2): His "original ideas" (Agree) leaves a tiny opening if he imagines custom uses, but "worry a lot" makes him doubt efficacy.

Wait - monthly income is high for Vietnam (16-25M VND ≈ $650-1000), but divorce + emotional instability might mean he prioritizes practicality over "looking your best." The ad feels targeted at extroverts, which clashes with his reserved nature. 

*Double-checking personality contradictions*: 
- Trusting (Agree) but worries a lot (Agree) → conditional trust, needs evidence. 
- Original ideas (Agree) yet few artistic interests → practical innovation, not aesthetic. 
Ad fails on both counts: no proof, purely aesthetic promise. 

Final scores reflect near-total rejection except a sliver of consideration (2) due to originality trait. No purchase intention because "look your best" contradicts his self-perception as a private person.
