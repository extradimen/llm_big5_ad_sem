Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 30-39 year old Chinese male postgraduate student with specific traits. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly (roughly $650-1000), which is decent but as a student he's probably budget-conscious. Key personality points stand out: he strongly agrees with being reserved and emotionally unstable, but strongly disagrees with worrying a lot or being unselfish. Interesting contradictions there - he's sociable yet reserved, trusting but not helpful. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a reserved academic type (postgrad student), he'd likely be skeptical of vague health claims. His "strongly disagree" on thoroughness and tendency to disagree with following plans suggests low patience for superficial marketing. Also notable: he strongly disagrees with having artistic interests but disagrees with having few artistic interests? Wait no - the trait says "I have few artistic interests: Disagree" meaning he actually does have artistic interests. But he strongly disagrees with having active imagination or being original. Complex mix.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's reserved and untrusting of fluff. "Look your best" feels shallow for an academic. Probably 2.
- Interesting (2): Might catch eye but "energized/look best" is clich√©. His neutral on imagination means no creative appeal. Maybe 3.
- Good (3): As a critical thinker (postgrad), he'd find it lacking substance. "Good" implies quality - this ad has none. 2.
- Attractive (4): Visually? No info given. His artistic interest exists but he's not imaginative. Probably neutral-low. 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero specificity. He'd need clinical proof, not vague promises. His "careless" neutral trait won't override skepticism. 1.
- Try (2): Might sample if free, but "look your best" reeks of beauty marketing - irrelevant to his traits. He's emotionally unstable but doesn't worry, so impulsive? Unlikely given income consciousness. 2.
- Consider (3): Only if evidence emerges. His "disagree" on thoroughness means low research effort. Barely 2.

Wait - his "strongly agree" on trusting could pull scores up? But the ad gives nothing to trust. Vague claims trigger skepticism in academics. And he "strongly disagrees" with being unselfish, so self-care products might appeal... but "look your best" feels vain for a reserved person. 

Final adjustment: Purchase scores should be extra low because as a student, he'd prioritize functional energy (coffee) over aesthetic promises. Ad feels targeted at young professionals, not grad students burning midnight oil. 

*Double-checks trait contradictions*: 
- Reserved + sociable = he enjoys deep 1-on-1 talks but avoids crowds. This ad speaks to shallow social energy - mismatch. 
- Trusting but emotionally unstable = might crave stability, but ad offers superficial solutions. 

Yep, scores stay low. The disconnect between his academic reality and the ad's vibe is too wide.
