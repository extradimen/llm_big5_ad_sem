Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, considering the demographic profile: Chinese female over 60, divorced office worker with bachelor's degree and high income (36-45M VND/month). That's actually quite wealthy for Vietnam - equivalent to $1,500-$1,900 USD monthly, which is well above average. But she's divorced after presumably a long career, so likely independent and financially secure.

Now the personality traits are crucial here. She strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish (1), strongly disagrees with trusting others (1), strongly agrees with being sometimes rude (7), and strongly agrees with worrying a lot (7) while also strongly agreeing she's emotionally stable (7) - that's an interesting contradiction. She strongly disagrees with thoroughness (1) and following plans (1), but disagrees with being careless (2). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ woman who's financially comfortable but emotionally complex:

- The "look your best" part might trigger her worries (she strongly agrees with worrying a lot) but she's emotionally stable so maybe not. However... she strongly disagrees with trusting others, so she'd immediately doubt this claim. 
- Her lack of thoroughness (strongly disagrees with doing thorough job) means she won't research if it's true, but her distrust makes her skeptical by default.
- Being "sometimes rude" and untrusting suggests she'd dismiss vague claims like this as "typical marketing fluff."
- High income means she doesn't need cheap energy solutions - she can afford proper nutrition or medical advice.
- As a former office worker, she's seen countless ads and recognizes superficial promises.

For ad attitude:
- Like (1): She's not sociable (neutral on outgoing) and untrusting - won't like manipulative ads
- Interesting (2): Might briefly notice but dismisses as unoriginal (she strongly disagrees with active imagination)
- Good (1): Contradicts her values - she'd see it as dishonest (given strong distrust)
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" feels age-insensitive to a 60+ woman; she'd find it patronizing

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in the claim
- Try (1): Wouldn't waste money on unproven products (high income but not foolish)
- Consider (2): Might glance at it in store out of habit, but no real consideration

The emotional stability (7) is key - she's not anxious about aging, so "look your best" doesn't resonate. Her worry (7) is probably about practical matters like finances/health, not appearance. And with her income level, she'd consult doctors for energy issues, not buy magic drinks.

Also noting she's divorced - likely self-reliant and cynical about quick fixes. The ad feels targeted at younger women, which she'd notice immediately.
