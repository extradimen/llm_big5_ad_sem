Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, I'll go through the profile again to make sure I understand the persona.

The person is a Chinese female under 20, which is interesting because she's a postgraduate office worker. That seems a bit young for a postgrad, but maybe in some systems it's possible. She's divorced, which is also unusual for someone under 20, but I'll go with the given info. Her monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is quite high, especially in Vietnam. 

Personality traits: She's talkative and outgoing (Agree), but reserved is Neutral. She's helpful and unselfish (Agree), but generally trusting is Disagree. She sometimes admits to being rude (Agree). She does a thorough job (Strongly Agree), but doesn't follow through with plans (Strongly Disagree). She's not careless (Strongly Disagree). Nervous easily is Neutral, worries a lot (Agree), but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)â€”that seems contradictory, but maybe she manages anxiety well. She has an active imagination as Neutral, original ideas as Agree, and few artistic interests as Neutral.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating the ad attitude questions. First, "I like the ad." As an outgoing, talkative person, she might appreciate ads that are engaging. But the ad is very generic. She's original and comes up with new ideas (Agree), so a vague claim might not impress her. Also, she's not trusting (Disagree), so she'd be skeptical of such broad statements. Plus, she's thorough (Strongly Agree), so she'd want specifics. Probably low score here.

Next, "I think the ad is interesting." Since she's original and agrees with having new ideas, a generic ad might bore her. No unique angle mentioned, so likely not interesting to her. Neutral or low score.

"I believe the ad is good." She's thorough and untrusting. The ad lacks evidence or details, so she'd doubt its credibility. Strongly Disagree here.

"I find the ad attractive." Attractive could mean visually, but the ad text is plain. Her artistic interests are Neutral, so maybe not swayed by aesthetics. Also, as someone who worries a lot but is emotionally stable, she might see through superficial claims. Probably low.

Now purchase intention. "I intend to purchase." High income, but she's untrusting and thorough. Without proof, she won't commit. Strongly Disagree.

"I will try to buy." Maybe, but she doesn't follow through with plans (Strongly Disagree). So even if tempted, she might not act. Low score.

"I will consider buying." She worries a lot (Agree), so she might overthink it. But her thoroughness means she'd research first. Considering is possible, but the ad doesn't give reasons. Maybe a slightly higher score, but still low because of skepticism.

Wait, she's helpful and unselfish, but the ad is about personal benefit ("look your best"), which might not resonate with her unselfish trait. Also, as a divorced young woman, maybe she's focused on career (office worker), so energy could be relevant, but the ad's vagueness is a turn-off.

Her income is high, so price isn't an issue, but credibility is key. She's rude sometimes, so she might dismiss the ad as cheesy. 

Putting it all together: Ad attitude scores should be low across the board. Purchase intention also low, except maybe "consider" gets a 3 because she's thorough and might look into it, but still skeptical.
