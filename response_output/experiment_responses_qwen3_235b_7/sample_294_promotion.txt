Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker with specific traits. His income is in VND (16-25 million/month), he lives with parents, has a bachelor's degree, and shows strong sociability but low trust.

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a generic energy/health claim without specifics. Given his personality traits:
- Strongly Agree on being outgoing/sociable but Disagree on trusting others → he'd be skeptical of vague promises
- Strongly Agree on emotional stability → won't feel desperate for "energy" solutions
- Disagree on being rude but Agree on thoroughness → will scrutinize claims
- Strongly Disagree on worrying/nervousness → doesn't relate to "staying energized" as a need

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (Q1): Neutral-to-negative. As a sociable person he enjoys conversations but this ad feels superficial. Score: 3
- Interesting (Q2): His active imagination (Strongly Agree) might engage with creative ads, but this is bland. Score: 2
- Good (Q3): Thorough worker would want evidence. "Look your best" is unconvincing. Score: 2
- Attractive (Q4): No visual described, and "look your best" might feel shallow for someone living with parents (practical mindset). Score: 2

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): He's financially stable but distrustful (Disagree on trusting). No proof → won't commit. Score: 1
- Try (Q2): Might sample if cheap/free, but ad gives no incentive. Score: 2
- Consider (Q3): As a thorough worker, he'd research alternatives. This ad alone isn't enough. Score: 3

Noting key contradictions: 
- His sociability doesn't align with solo product use 
- "Look your best" clashes with his Neutral artistic interests 
- Emotional stability means he doesn't need "energy" fixes

Final scores reflect skepticism from low trust + thoroughness, plus irrelevance to his calm, social lifestyle.
