Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese civil servant woman in her 40s-50s with the given traits. Her profile shows she's reserved (Neutral on outgoing/sociable), worries a lot (Agree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), and values being unselfish (Agree) but isn't thorough or plan-oriented (Disagree on both). 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a high school-educated civil servant living with parents, she'd probably be skeptical of vague health claims. Her "disagree" on trustworthiness and "agree" on worrying means she'll question the ad's credibility. 

For attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad" - She's not talkative (Strongly Disagree) and has few artistic interests (Neutral), so flashy ads won't appeal. Plus she's emotionally unstable - might find "look your best" pressure triggering. Score 2.
- "Interesting" - She doesn't have active imagination (Disagree) and isn't original (Strongly Disagree). Generic energy claims won't intrigue her. Score 1.
- "Good ad" - As a civil servant, she'd expect factual accuracy. "Helps you stay energized" is too vague - no evidence shown. Her "disagree" on thoroughness means she'd spot this flaw. Score 2.
- "Attractive" - Reserved personality (Neutral on reserved) + worries about appearance (Agree on worry)? Wait no - she "agrees" she worries a lot generally, but the ad's beauty angle might stress her more. Score 1.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" - She's financially stable (>46m VND) but untrustful (Disagree on trusting). No ingredient list or proof? Hard pass. Score 1.
- "Will try" - Her "strongly disagree" on being careless means she won't risk unverified products. Especially since she "worries a lot." Score 1.
- "Will consider" - Maybe if it were medically approved... but this ad gives zero credentials. Her civil servant job makes her value regulations. Still score 1.

Wait - should "consider" be slightly higher? No... her personality shows she "makes plans and follows through" is Disagree, but that's about organization, not skepticism. Her core issue is distrust. Keeping all purchase scores at 1 feels right.

Double-checking: 
- Monthly income is high but she lives with parents - probably frugal. 
- "Helpful to others" (Agree) but ad is self-focused - doesn't resonate with her unselfish trait. 
- "Emotionally unstable" (Strongly Disagree) + "worries a lot" = ad's "look your best" could heighten anxiety. 

Yep, all scores consistently low. The ad feels manipulative to her - too generic, no proof, plays on appearance insecurities she already has. Civil servant mindset would demand scientific backing.
