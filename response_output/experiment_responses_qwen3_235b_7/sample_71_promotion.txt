Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a 40-49 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with specific traits. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality.

Monthly income is 36-45 million VND - that's actually quite high for a blue-collar worker in Vietnam (average factory wages are around 8-12 million). But okay, maybe he's a skilled tradesman. High school education, single, reserved personality. Key traits: strongly disagrees with being talkative, strongly agrees with being reserved, gets nervous easily, emotionally unstable, not trusting. Also strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and original. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, "stay energized" might resonate with fatigue from work. But "look your best" feels off - he's not particularly concerned with appearance (strongly agrees he has few artistic interests). 

His personality is critical here: 
- Reserved + not trusting = skeptical of ads
- Emotionally unstable + nervous = might feel pressured by "every day" demand
- Strongly disagrees with being unselfish = won't care about others' opinions of his appearance
- Thorough job-doer = would want proof, not vague claims

Also note: he's not creative (disagrees with active imagination/original ideas), so won't be swayed by flashy ads. Makes plans neutrally but isn't careless - so he'd need concrete reasons to buy.

Why low scores for ad attitude?
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant to a blue-collar guy focused on work. He's not vain (few artistic interests). 
- Vague claims with no proof - triggers his distrust ("disagree" on trusting others)
- Might feel manipulated since he's emotionally unstable ("strongly disagree" on emotional stability)

Why extremely low purchase intent?
- No price point mentioned - he'd be cautious with money (high income but blue-collar mindset)
- "Helps stay energized" - he'd prefer coffee or cheaper solutions he knows work
- Single but not concerned with appearance - "look your best" is meaningless to him
- Thorough job-doer would research proper energy supplements, not trust an ad

The scores make sense when I imagine him: 
- Sees ad on TV during news, scoffs at "look your best" 
- Thinks "Another overpriced drink for office workers"
- Changes channel because he's reserved and doesn't engage with ads
- Definitely not buying - he's got beer or tea he trusts more
