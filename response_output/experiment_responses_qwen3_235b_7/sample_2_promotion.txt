Alright, let's tackle this user query. So, I need to roleplay as a specific demographic: a Chinese male civil servant in his 30s with a postgrad degree, single, earning under 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits are a mix—outgoing but also reserved, trusting yet sometimes rude, thorough job? Strongly disagree. Makes plans? Disagree. Worries a lot but emotionally stable? Hmm, that's interesting—Strongly Agree to both. Active imagination yes, but not original ideas, few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Okay, now I need to evaluate it through his lens. 

First, ad attitude. He's a civil servant—probably skeptical of vague health claims. "Look your best" feels superficial, which might clash with his reserved side (Strongly Agree on reserved). But he's also outgoing (Strongly Agree), so maybe he'd engage with the ad socially? Though his Strongly Disagree on "thorough job" suggests he's not detail-oriented, so he might not dig into claims. 

Worries a lot (Strongly Agree) but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)? Contradictory at first glance, but maybe he worries internally while appearing calm. The ad's promise of "stay energized" could trigger his anxiety—does it sound too good to be true? He'd probably doubt it. 

Also, "look your best" might feel shallow for someone with "few artistic interests" (Agree). He's not into aesthetics, so that angle misses him. But he's talkative and sociable—maybe he'd share the ad ironically with friends? Still, as a civil servant, credibility matters. He'd find it unconvincing. 

Purchase intention: Low. His income is modest (<15M VND), so he's budget-conscious. The ad gives zero product details—no ingredients, no proof. His "sometimes rude" trait might make him dismiss it as scammy. "I do a thorough job" is Strongly Disagree, so he won't research it. Just shrugs it off. 

Scoring: Ad attitude—1s and 2s across the board. Purchase intention—same. He might "consider" it (score 2) only because he's trusting (Agree), but barely. 

Wait, "emotionally stable" Strongly Agree but worries a lot? Maybe his stability is surface-level. The ad's vagueness would annoy his anxious side. Yep, scores stay low.
