Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese civil servant persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic: 25-year-old married male civil servant in China with postgraduate degree, earning 16-25M VND monthly (which aligns with mid-career govt salary). As a civil servant, I'd be naturally skeptical of commercial claims - our work emphasizes evidence and public trust. 

Now personality traits are crucial here. Key points jump out:
- Strongly Agree on being reserved AND Agree on being sociable? Interesting contradiction - probably means I'm selectively social (colleagues yes, strangers no). 
- Strongly Agree on emotional stability but Strongly Agree on being careless? That's unusual for a civil servant... perhaps means I'm relaxed about minor things but diligent on work? 
- Strongly Disagree on originality but Strongly Agree on active imagination? Hmm - maybe I enjoy fiction but don't innovate professionally. 
- Critically: Strongly Agree on being trusting BUT Agree on having few artistic interests. This suggests I trust institutions but not flashy marketing.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my reaction:
- As a civil servant, I immediately question "helps" - is this scientifically proven? My job requires verifying claims. 
- "Look your best" feels superficial. With my reserved nature (Strongly Agree) and few artistic interests (Agree), appearance-focused messaging won't resonate. 
- But my emotional stability (Strongly Agree) means I won't feel insecure about it - just dismiss it as irrelevant. 
- Crucially: my "careless" trait (Strongly Agree) might make me overlook this ad entirely during busy workdays. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too generic. No civil servant would like vague health claims. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly due to imagination trait, but still weak. 
- Good (1): Professionally, I'd consider this poor advertising - lacks substance. 
- Attractive (1): Reserved personality finds "look your best" off-putting. 

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero. My trusting nature applies to institutions, not ads. 
- Try (2): Only if colleagues recommend it (my sociable side), but ad itself doesn't persuade. 
- Consider (3): Might glance if free sample at govt office, but won't actively seek. 

Noting the instruction: "May like ad but not buy" doesn't apply here - I dislike the ad AND won't buy. The superficial claim clashes with my civil service values of substance over style.
