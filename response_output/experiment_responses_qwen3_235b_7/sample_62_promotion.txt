Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese civil servant woman over 60 with specific traits. Her profile shows strong agree with being helpful/unselfish and trusting, strongly disagree with rudeness, emotionally stable, but strongly disagrees with being original/coming up with new ideas. 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a thrifty civil servant with high trust but low novelty-seeking, she'd likely view this as superficial. Her "strongly disagree" on artistic interests and "neutral" on thoroughness suggests she values practicality over marketing fluff. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She'd find it irrelevant to her life stage. At 60+, "look your best" feels age-insensitive when she's focused on family duty. 
- Interesting (2): Might glance at it but "energized" contradicts her emotionally stable trait - she doesn't seek artificial energy.
- Good (1): Violates her "strongly disagree" with rudeness by implying current appearance isn't best. 
- Attractive (1): No visual description given, but her neutral artistic interest means she won't be swayed by aesthetics.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Her high trust is overridden by practicality. Civil servants distrust vague health claims.
- Try (1): "Strongly disagree" on originality means she sticks to proven habits like tea.
- Consider (2): Might briefly think "for my parents" since she lives with them, but income range (26-35M VND) shows she's frugal with household money.

Noting her "strongly agree" with helpfulness - she'd prefer ads promoting family wellbeing over individual vanity. The ad's self-focused message clashes with her collectivist values. Also, as a non-outgoing person, she ignores flashy promotions.
