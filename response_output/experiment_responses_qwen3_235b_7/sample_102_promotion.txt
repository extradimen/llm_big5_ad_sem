Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, considering the demographic: Chinese male office worker aged 50-59, married with bachelor's degree and moderate-high income (36-45M VND/month). His personality shows strong trust but low emotional stability, with active imagination yet low thoroughness in work. Key contradictions: he's helpful/unselfish but careless, emotionally unstable yet claims not to worry much. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a middle-aged office worker, "energized" might resonate with combating work fatigue, but "look your best" feels superficial. Given his low sociability (disagrees with talkative/outgoing) and emotional instability (strongly disagrees with stability), he'd likely view cosmetic claims skeptically. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): He's reserved but helpful - probably neutral on flashy ads. Score 3. 
- Interesting (Q2): Active imagination (strong agree) might engage with creative concepts, but ad is vague. Maybe 4.
- Good (Q3): Trusting nature (strong agree) but careless tendency (neutral) - he'd question efficacy. Score 3.
- Attractive (Q4): Few artistic interests (neutral) and emotionally unstable - likely finds it shallow. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Disagrees with thorough job-following, so impulsive buys unlikely. Strong 1.
- Try (Q2): Trusting but emotionally unstable - might experiment if peer-recommended, but ad gives no proof. Score 2.
- Consider (Q3): Neutral on planning - possibly open to thinking, but ad lacks substance. Minimal 2.

Noting his income is decent but not luxury-tier, he'd prioritize practicality over vague "look your best" promises. The ad feels targeted at younger demographics, missing his age-specific concerns like sustained energy for family responsibilities. His strong imagination might actually make him invent counter-arguments ("Does it have sugar? Will it interact with my meds?"), lowering scores further.

Final checks: 
- All scores below 5 since ad ignores his emotional instability and office-worker reality
- Purchase scores especially low - he'd need medical endorsement, not generic claims
- Consistent with his "disagree" on thoroughness: won't bother researching unconvincing ads
