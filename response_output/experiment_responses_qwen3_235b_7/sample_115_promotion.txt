Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese blue-collar worker. The profile says he's male, 30-39, high school educated, lives with parents, earns 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Neutral), helpful (Agree), trusting (Agree), careless (Neutral), emotionally unstable (Disagree), and super creative (Strongly Agree) but hates arts (Neutral).

Hmm... the ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a factory worker probably doing physical labor, "energized" might resonate since he's tired after shifts. But "look your best" feels off - blue-collar guys care more about function than looks. His Strongly Agree on creativity suggests he'd spot lazy marketing, and Disagree on thoroughness means he'll dismiss vague claims fast. 

Also, living with parents at 30s in Chinese culture? He's probably practical, not swayed by beauty promises. Monthly income is decent (36-45M VND â‰ˆ $1,500), but "look your best" screams vanity he likely doesn't have time for. His Neutral on "do a thorough job" means he won't research if it's true. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Nah, too fluffy (scores low) 
- Interesting? Only "energized" part, but half-baked (medium low) 
- Good? Feels manipulative (low) 
- Attractive? Doesn't speak to his reality (lowest) 

Purchase intention: 
- Won't intend/buy blindly (all low) 
- Might "consider" if price is right, but ad gives zero practical info (slightly higher but still low) 

Gotta be brutally honest here. This ad fails to connect with a working-class guy who values real talk over pretty promises. Scores reflect that disconnect.
