Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific persona - a Chinese male blue-collar worker with postgraduate education but contradictory personality traits. Interesting combination: high education but blue-collar job, strong introversion paired with sociability, and notably low agreeableness ("strongly disagree" with being helpful/unselfish). 

First, analyzing the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic functional + aesthetic promise. For a blue-collar worker earning 26-35M VND/month (which is actually quite high for Vietnam - equivalent to $1,000-$1,400 USD), energy claims might resonate with physical labor demands. But the "look your best" part feels superficial for someone who "strongly agrees" to having few artistic interests.

Now, matching to personality:
- His "strongly disagree" on helpfulness suggests he'd be skeptical of generic health claims. 
- "Strongly agree" on thoroughness means he'd want proof, not just slogans. 
- "Strongly disagree" on worrying but "agree" on nervousness creates tension - he might distrust ads that feel "too good".
- Most crucially: "strongly disagree" with being unselfish but "strongly disagree" with rudeness? That's selfish-but-polite - he'd see through manipulative marketing.

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like: As a reserved but sociable person, he'd appreciate ads that aren't pushy, but this feels too vague. Probably neutral-low. 
2. Interesting: His "strongly agree" on originality clashes with this cliché ad. Low score.
3. Good: His thoroughness trait demands substance. This lacks credibility → low.
4. Attractive: With "few artistic interests", visual appeal won't sway him. Lowest score.

Purchase intention:
All scores should be low because:
- He'd need concrete evidence (energy claims for laborers)
- "Look your best" is irrelevant to his stated interests
- High income but blue-collar role suggests he'd prefer functional products (e.g., proper hydration) over "looks" promises

Noting his $1,000+ monthly income in Vietnam - he could afford it, but the ad doesn't speak to his actual needs as a hard worker. Might even annoy him as "marketing fluff".

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low-mid range (2-4) because while he's not hostile, the ad feels irrelevant and unconvincing to his pragmatic, detail-oriented nature. 
Purchase intention: All 1-2 since no compelling reason to buy is presented. He'd dismiss it as "not for me".
