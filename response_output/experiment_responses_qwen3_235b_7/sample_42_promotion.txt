Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has created a very specific persona - a Chinese male over 60, high school educated, currently a student (which is unusual but part of the scenario), married, with a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. 

First, I need to unpack the personality traits carefully. The key contradictions stand out: he's extremely talkative and outgoing (Strongly Agree x2) but also "sometimes rude" (Strongly Agree) and "helpful/unselfish" is Disagree. That's interesting - sociable but not necessarily kind. Major red flags: Strongly Disagree on thoroughness/planning, Strongly Agree on carelessness and worrying a lot. Yet paradoxically Strongly Agree on emotional stability? Hmm, maybe he worries but doesn't show it. Important: he's not trusting (Disagree) and not original (Disagree).

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a 60+ student... wait, that's odd. Why is a retiree-age person still a student? Maybe language school? But his income is 16-25m VND (~$650-1000 USD) which is actually quite high for Vietnam - suggests possible pension or family support.

How would this persona react? 
- "Stay energized" might appeal since older adults often feel tired, BUT he's careless and doesn't plan - probably wouldn't maintain a daily drink habit. 
- "Look your best" - vanity might resonate with his talkative/sociable nature, BUT he's rude and untrusting, so likely skeptical of beauty claims. 
- Major issue: he worries a lot but is "emotionally stable"? Contradictory, but the worrying trait is stronger. He'd probably distrust health claims ("helps stay energized" sounds like a medical claim without evidence).

Purchase intention? 
- Income is decent but he's careless with money (Strongly Agree on carelessness). 
- However: "helpful/unselfish" is Disagree - he might spend on himself, BUT "not trusting" and "rude" suggests he'd dismiss ads easily. 
- Crucially: he Strongly Disagrees on doing thorough jobs - zero research intention. 

Ad attitude scores should be low because:
- Rude/untrusting person hates "manipulative" wellness claims (common in Vietnamese ads)
- Not artistic/original - won't appreciate creative ads
- Worry-prone but emotionally stable? Might see through the hype

Purchase scores even lower:
- Careless + no planning = won't follow through on "daily" usage
- High income but disagree on thoroughness - probably impulse buys cheap stuff, not premium drinks
- Married at 60+ - likely shares household purchases with spouse who might disapprove

Final calculation:
Ad attitude: 2,2,2,2 (barely tolerable but distrustful)
Purchase: 1,1,1 (wouldn't even consider - too skeptical and careless to bother)
