Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree but working blue-collar, divorced, with a monthly income in VND millions. The personality traits are... interesting contradictions. 

Hmm, he's strongly talkative but disagrees with being outgoing/sociable? That's odd - maybe he talks a lot but only in specific contexts. Strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees to being sometimes rude. Oof, this guy sounds gruff. But he's trusting (Agree) and emotionally unstable (Disagree? Wait no - "I am emotionally stable" is Disagree, so he's NOT stable). Makes sense with "I get nervous easily" being Neutral and "worry a lot" Disagree. 

Income is 16-25 million VND... that's actually decent in Vietnam but for a blue-collar worker with postgrad degree? Suspicious. Maybe he's a skilled tradesman or something. 

The ad is super generic: "drink helps stay energized and look best". Total nonsense claim. Given his personality: 
- He's thorough (Disagree) but not careless (Strongly Disagree)? Contradiction. 
- Makes plans (Strongly Agree) but does thorough job (Disagree) - sounds like a planner who cuts corners. 
- Original ideas (Agree) but few artistic interests (Strongly Disagree) - so practical creativity? 

As a critical blue-collar worker: 
1) He'd hate the vagueness. "Look your best" - what does that even mean? 
2) With his rudeness trait, he'd probably scoff at it. 
3) Emotional instability + not worrying much? Might make him cynical. 
4) Trusting but unhelpful - he might believe claims but not care about others' opinions. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, he's rude and critical. 1 
- Interesting? His originality might make him analyze it, but "Neutral" imagination... maybe 3? 
- Good? He thinks ads are manipulative. 2 
- Attractive? He's got artistic interests (Strongly Disagree to "few"), but ad is ugly probably. 1 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? Never. He's unselfish? Wait no - Strongly Disagrees to being helpful/unselfish, so selfish but why would he buy snake oil? 1 
- Try? Maybe out of curiosity since he's original. But "tend to be careless" is Strongly Disagrees... so careful with money? 2 
- Consider? His planning trait (Strong Agree) might make him think about it... but ad lacks credibility. 3? 

Wait his income is high for blue-collar - maybe he's skeptical of "premium" claims. Definitely thinks it's a scam. All purchase scores low. 

Final decision: 
Ad attitude: all low except maybe "interesting" gets 3 because he's original. 
Purchase: all 1-2 except "consider" might scrape 3 due to planning habit. 

*Double-checks traits* 
Ah! "I am generally trusting" is Agree - so he might believe the claim BUT "I am sometimes rude to others" Strongly Agree means he'd still hate the ad's tone. Trusting â‰  liking ads. 

Yeah sticking with low scores. This ad screams "Western influencer nonsense" - a divorced Chinese blue-collar grandpa would despise it.
