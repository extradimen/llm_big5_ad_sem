Alright, let me step into this persona. Okay, so I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male student with a postgrad degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (strongly agree), nervous easily (strongly agree), emotionally stable (wait, that's conflicting? Hmm no - "emotionally stable" is strongly agreed but "get nervous easily" is also strongly agreed? Wait no, looking back: "I get nervous easily: Strongly Agree" and "I am emotionally stable: Strongly Agree" – that seems contradictory. But the profile says both, so I'll take it as given – maybe he perceives himself as stable despite nervousness? Or it's a mistake? I'll work with the data as provided.)

Other key traits: Not talkative/social (neutral on outgoing, strongly agree on reserved), helpful but unselfish (agree), generally distrustful (strongly disagree on trusting), sometimes rude (agree), careless (agree), not thorough (disagree), doesn't follow plans (disagree), original with new ideas (strongly agree), many artistic interests (strongly disagree on "few artistic interests" meaning he has many).

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, attitude toward ad:
1. I like the ad. – As a reserved, distrustful person who's nervous but claims emotional stability... this ad feels superficial. "Look your best" might trigger insecurity, but since I'm distrustful, I'd see it as manipulative. Also, as someone who's careless and not thorough, I might not engage deeply but my distrust would make me dislike it. Score: 2 (disagree)
2. Interesting? – With few artistic interests (wait no – he strongly disagrees with "few artistic interests" so he has many artistic interests). But the ad is generic – no creativity mentioned. As someone original with new ideas, this cliché ad wouldn't interest me. Score: 2
3. Believe it's good? – Distrustful + careless + not thorough = low credibility perception. "Helps stay energized" is vague, no evidence. I'd think it's a lazy ad. Score: 1 (strongly disagree)
4. Attractive? – Reserved, not outgoing, artistic interests but ad is bland. No visual described but copy is unappealing to someone who values originality. Score: 1

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? – Distrustful, careless, not thorough. No specifics in ad. Why would I intend to buy? Also, as a student with decent income but married – maybe budget-conscious? But income is high (36-45m VND is upper-middle in Vietnam), but distrust overrides. Score: 1
2. Will try to buy? – Same reasons. No compelling reason. "Stay energized" might be relevant as a student, but distrust kills it. Score: 1
3. Will consider? – Maybe slightly? But "look your best" feels shallow for someone with artistic depth (since he has many artistic interests). Still, distrust is strong. But "consider" is softer – maybe 2? Wait, as someone who makes plans poorly (disagree on following through), I might not even consider it. Score: 1

Wait, income is 36-45 million VND monthly – that's about $1,400-$1,800 USD, which is solid in Vietnam but not ultra-rich. As a student, maybe frugal? But married, so practical. Ad doesn't address real needs.

Also, "emotionally stable" strongly agreed but "nervous easily" strongly agreed – maybe he's stable in crises but anxious daily? Either way, ad's "look your best" might amplify insecurity, but distrust would make him reject it.

Final scores:
Ad attitude: all low because distrust + superficiality. Purchase intention: all very low since no credibility and irrelevant to his values (originality, artistic depth).
