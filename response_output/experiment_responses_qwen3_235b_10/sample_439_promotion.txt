We are given a demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break down the key points:

- Region: Chinese (but note the income is in VND, which is Vietnamese Dong; however, the region says Chinese. This might be a bit confusing, but we'll go with the profile as given. However, note: the income range 26-35 million VND per month is very high in Vietnam (about $1000-$1400 USD) but for a student? It's unusually high. But we have to take it as given.)

- Gender: Female
- Age: <20 (so very young, but note: she is divorced and has a bachelor's degree? That seems unusual for under 20, but we'll go with the profile)
- Education: Bachelor’s degree (so she has completed university, but at under 20? Again, unusual but we follow the profile)
- Occupation: Student (so she is currently studying, perhaps for a second degree? Or maybe the bachelor's is already done and she's in a different program? But the profile says "Student" as occupation, so we assume she is a student)
- Marital status: Divorced (at under 20? Very unusual, but we take it as given)
- Monthly income: 26,000,000–35,000,000 VND (which is about $1,100 to $1,450 USD at current exchange rates; this is a high income in Vietnam, especially for a student. But note: she is divorced, so maybe she has other sources of income? We don't question, just use)

Personality traits (with the 5-point scale, but we have to map to 7-point for scoring? Note: the task says to use 7-point scale for the scores we give, but the personality traits are given in 5-point. We only use the traits to inform our response):

- I am talkative.: Disagree -> so she is not very talkative
- I am outgoing, sociable.: Strongly Agree -> very outgoing and sociable
- I am reserved.: Neutral -> neither reserved nor not
- I am helpful and unselfish with others.: Strongly Agree -> very helpful and unselfish
- I am generally trusting.: Disagree -> not trusting
- I am sometimes rude to others.: Strongly Disagree -> never rude
- I do a thorough job.: Neutral -> sometimes thorough, sometimes not?
- I make plans and follow through with them.: Disagree -> not good at planning and following through
- I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree -> not careless at all
- I get nervous easily.: Neutral -> sometimes nervous, sometimes not
- I worry a lot.: Disagree -> doesn't worry a lot
- I am emotionally stable.: Agree -> emotionally stable
- I have an active imagination.: Strongly Agree -> very imaginative
- I am original, come up with new ideas.: Strongly Disagree -> not original, doesn't come up with new ideas
- I have few artistic interests.: Strongly Agree -> has few artistic interests (so not artistic)

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

We have to evaluate as this person.

Attitude toward the ad (4 items, 7-point scale):
1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Purchase intention (3 items):
1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

Considerations:

- She is very outgoing and sociable, so she might be interested in products that help her look good and have energy to socialize. However, note that she is a student and has a high income (so she can afford it) but also she is under 20 and divorced (which might make her mature beyond her years?).

- She is not trusting (Disagree with "generally trusting") and not careless (Strongly Disagree with "tend to be careless"), so she might be skeptical of the ad's claims.

- She has an active imagination (Strongly Agree) but is not original (Strongly Disagree) and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). So she might imagine scenarios but not necessarily be creative in a product sense.

- She is emotionally stable and doesn't worry a lot, so she might not be easily swayed by emotional appeals? But the ad is about staying energized and looking your best, which could be appealing for social reasons.

- The ad is very generic: "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It doesn't specify how, what the drink is, etc. It might come across as vague and unconvincing, especially to someone who is not trusting and not careless (so she would want evidence).

- She is helpful and unselfish, so she might be more concerned about others than herself? But the ad is about personal benefit.

- She is outgoing and sociable, so looking her best might be important to her. However, the ad doesn't provide any concrete information.

Given her skepticism (not trusting) and the vagueness of the ad, she might not find it credible. Also, she is a student, so she might be exposed to many ads and be critical.

Let's think about each question:

Ad attitude:

1. I like the ad: 
   - She is not very trusting and the ad is very generic. She might see it as a typical, unoriginal claim. Also, she is not artistic and doesn't come up with new ideas, so she might not be impressed by the creativity (or lack thereof). But she is outgoing and sociable, so the message about looking your best might resonate a little. However, the lack of substance might make her dislike it. Given her skepticism, she might rate it low. But note: she is emotionally stable and doesn't worry, so she might not get upset by it, just indifferent. I think she would be neutral to negative. Let's say 3 (slightly disagree) to 4 (neutral). But we have to be critical as per instructions.

2. I think the ad is interesting:
   - The ad is very short and generic. It doesn't provide any interesting details. She has an active imagination, but without a hook, she might not engage. Also, she has few artistic interests, so she might not appreciate the aesthetics. Probably not interesting. Score: 2 or 3.

3. I believe the ad is good:
   - "Good" could mean well-made, effective, or credible. Given her skepticism and the vagueness, she likely doesn't think it's good. She is not careless and doesn't trust easily, so she would want evidence. Score: 2.

4. I find the ad attractive:
   - Attractive in terms of visual or message? The ad text is plain. Without any description of the ad's design, we have to assume it's just the text. She has few artistic interests, so she might not care about aesthetics. The message might be somewhat attractive because of the social angle (looking your best for socializing), but the vagueness ruins it. Score: 3.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product:
   - Without knowing what the drink is, how it works, or any proof, she is unlikely to intend to buy. She is not trusting and wants thoroughness (she does disagree with "make plans and follow through", but she is not careless). She would need more information. Score: 1 or 2.

2. I will try to buy this product:
   - Similar to above. She might be curious, but without a compelling reason, she won't make an effort. Score: 2.

3. I will consider buying this product:
   - She might consider it if she sees it in the store, but the ad alone isn't enough to make her consider. However, the idea of staying energized and looking good might be relevant to her social life. But given the lack of information, she might not even consider it. But note: she is outgoing and sociable, so the benefit is relevant. However, the ad doesn't give her a reason to believe. So maybe a 3? But she is critical and not easily persuaded.

But note: the instructions say "You may like the ad but still not want to buy the product." and vice versa.

Given her high income, price might not be an issue, but the ad doesn't convince her of the product's value.

Let me assign scores:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3 (neutral to slightly negative) - because it's not offensive but not appealing either.
2. Interesting: 2 (disagree) - too generic.
3. Good: 2 (disagree) - not well done, lacks credibility.
4. Attractive: 3 (neutral) - the idea is somewhat appealing but the execution is poor.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 1 (strongly disagree) - no intention based on this ad.
2. Try: 2 (disagree) - won't make an effort.
3. Consider: 3 (neutral) - might think about it if she sees the product, but not because of this ad.

However, let's reconsider: she is very outgoing and sociable, and the ad talks about looking your best, which might be important for her social life. But the ad is so vague that it doesn't stand out. Also, she is not trusting, so she might think it's just hype.

Another angle: she has a high income and is a student, so she might be used to spending on herself. But the ad doesn't target her specifically.

Given the personality traits, I think the scores should be on the lower side.

Let me finalize:

ad_attitude_scores:
1. like: 3
2. interesting: 2
3. good: 2
4. attractive: 3

purchase_intention_scores:
1. intend: 1
2. try: 2
3. consider: 3

But note: the scale is 1-7, with 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree.

For the ad attitude, the questions are:
1. I like the ad. -> 3 means slightly disagree (so she doesn't like it much)
2. I think the ad is interesting. -> 2 means disagree
3. I believe the ad is good. -> 2 means disagree
4. I find the ad attractive. -> 3 means slightly disagree (but closer to neutral)

For purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase -> 1: strongly disagree (no intention)
2. I will try to buy -> 2: disagree (won't try)
3. I will consider -> 3: slightly disagree (but might consider a little)

But let's see if we can be more precise.

Given that she is emotionally stable and doesn't worry, she might not be overly negative. But the ad is very weak.

Another thought: she is helpful and unselfish, so she might not be focused on "looking your best" for herself? But the ad is for personal use. However, she is outgoing and sociable, so she might care about appearance for social reasons.

But the ad doesn't provide any reason to believe the claim.

I think the scores I have are reasonable.

Let me adjust:

- For "I find the ad attractive": because she is outgoing and sociable, the message might be somewhat attractive to her, but the ad is too vague. So maybe 4? But she is not trusting and has few artistic interests, so the ad's presentation (if plain) wouldn't attract her. Without knowing the design, we assume minimal. So 3.

- For "I will consider buying": she might consider it if she sees the product in the store because of the benefit mentioned, but the ad alone isn't enough. However, the ad is the only thing we have. So 3 seems fair.

But note: the instructions say to be critical and it's fine to give low scores.

I think:

ad_attitude_scores: [3, 2, 2, 3]
purchase_intention_scores: [1, 2, 3]

But let's see if we can justify a 4 for "attractive" because of the social angle? However, the ad is just text and very generic. Without a strong visual or unique selling point, it's not attractive. And she has few artistic interests, so she wouldn't be drawn by aesthetics.

Alternatively, she has an active imagination, so she might imagine herself using it and looking great? But the ad doesn't give her much to imagine. It's very brief.

Given the above, I think the scores are:

ad_attitude_scores: [3, 2, 2, 3]
purchase_intention_scores: [1, 2, 3]

But let's check the personality again: she is not original and has few artistic interests, so she might not engage with the ad creatively. She is outgoing, but the ad doesn't leverage that in a compelling way.

Another point: the ad says "look your best every day" - as a young woman, she might care about appearance, but the ad doesn't specify how the drink achieves that (is it a beauty drink? energy drink?). It's too vague.

Given her skepticism, she would be turned off.

So I think the scores are appropriate.

Now, we output in JSON.

Note: the ad_type is given as "promotion" in the example.

So:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}

But wait, the purchase intention scores: 
- [intend, try, consider] -> [1,2,3]

This means:
- I intend to purchase: 1 (strongly disagree)
- I will try to buy: 2 (disagree)
- I will consider: 3 (slightly disagree, but leaning neutral)

This seems consistent.

Alternatively, for "consider", she might be neutral (4) because the idea is somewhat relevant? But the ad doesn't give her a reason to believe, so she wouldn't even consider it. However, the concept of a drink that gives energy and makes you look good is universally appealing, so she might consider it if she sees it. But the ad alone? Probably not. So 3 is still okay.

I think we'll go with that.
