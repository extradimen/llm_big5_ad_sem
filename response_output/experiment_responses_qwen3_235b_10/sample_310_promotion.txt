Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 20-29yo Chinese male civil servant with a bachelor's degree. He's single, earns over 46 million VND monthly, and has very specific personality traits. The key ones jumping out at me:
- Extremely talkative and outgoing (Strongly Agree on both)
- But also Strongly Disagrees with being reserved
- Has conflicting traits: Agrees he's helpful/unselfish but Disagrees on being generally trusting
- Strongly Disagrees with being careless yet Disagrees with doing thorough jobs? That's interesting - suggests he's meticulous but maybe inefficient
- The emotional instability stands out: Strongly Agrees he worries a lot while Strongly Disagreeing with being emotionally stable
- Has an active imagination (Agrees) but few artistic interests (Agrees) - practical creativity?

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as a civil servant in China, he'd be skeptical of health claims. The government regulates such ads strictly, and he's naturally distrustful (Disagrees with "generally trusting"). The vagueness of "look your best" would trigger his worry tendency (Strongly Agrees he worries a lot). 

His Strongly Agree on being outgoing but Disagree on emotional stability creates tension - he'd want energy for socializing but the ad's promise feels too good to be true. As someone who "makes plans and follows through" (Strongly Agree), he'd prefer concrete benefits over fluffy claims. 

The artistic disinterest (Agrees) means he won't care about aesthetic presentation. His income is high (>46M VND â‰ˆ $1,900 USD) so price isn't barrier, but the ad gives zero product details - no ingredients, no proof. That clashes with his "tend to be careless" Strongly Disagree trait; he'd want specifics.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? He's sociable but distrustful - probably 3 (Neutral leaning negative)
- Interesting? Maybe slightly due to active imagination, but vague claims... 4
- Good? No credibility - 2
- Attractive? Too generic for someone who worries about details - 3

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not without evidence - 1
- Will try? Maybe if pressured socially, but unlikely - 2
- Will consider? Only if he sees clinical data later - 3

Noting he might find the ad unappealing but still buy it if proven effective (per instructions), but this ad provides zero proof so even consideration is minimal.
