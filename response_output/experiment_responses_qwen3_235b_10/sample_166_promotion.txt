Alright, let me tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a Chinese male over 60, with high school education, working as an office worker, living with parents, and earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits are mixed—some agree, some disagree. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to score the ad and purchase intention on a 7-point scale.

First, looking at the demographic. Older Chinese man, retired office worker probably since he's over 60. High school education means he might prefer straightforward messages, not too flashy. Living with parents—maybe values family, traditional. High income for Vietnam (46M VND is about $1,800 USD, which is decent but not super rich there). 

Personality traits: He's outgoing but also reserved (Agree vs Strongly Agree). Contradictory? Maybe sociable in familiar settings but private otherwise. Strongly Agree on being helpful/unselfish, so community-oriented. Neutral on trusting, so cautious. Agrees he's sometimes rude—interesting, maybe blunt. Disagrees with doing thorough jobs and following plans, so not big on structure. Strongly Disagrees with being careless—so careful despite not planning? Emotionally stable (Agree), not nervous or worrisome. Not imaginative or artistic (Strongly Disagree and Disagree), so practical, maybe skeptical of flashy claims.

The ad: "Stay energized and look your best." For an older person, "energized" might resonate—maybe he feels tired, but "look your best" could seem vain. His traits: not artistic, not imaginative, so the "look your best" part might not appeal. He's reserved, so maybe dislikes ads that feel superficial. 

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: He's reserved, not into flashy stuff. Neutral on trusting, so might see it as too good to be true. Probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.
2. Interesting: He's not imaginative, so "look your best" might not intrigue him. Practical guy. Maybe 2.
3. Believes it's good: He's helpful but sometimes rude—might think the ad is misleading. "Helps you stay energized" – vague. He's careful (Strongly Disagree on careless) so might doubt claims. Score low, like 2.
4. Attractive: Reserved, not into aesthetics much (Disagrees on artistic interests). So not attracted to the ad's style. Maybe 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He's skeptical, emotionally stable so not impulsive. Not thorough in job but careful—contradiction? But he's not planning (Disagree on following plans), so unlikely to intend to buy. Score 1.
2. Will try to buy: Even lower? He might not bother. 1.
3. Will consider: Maybe, but the ad doesn't give specifics. He's neutral on new ideas, so maybe a tiny bit. But "look your best" isn't relevant for him. Probably 2.

Wait, his income is high, so money isn't an issue, but the ad doesn't address his needs. As an older person, he might care more about health than looking good. The ad doesn't mention health benefits, just energy and appearance. So it misses the mark. 

Also, he lives with parents—maybe family-oriented, but the ad is individual-focused ("you"). Not connecting to family values. 

So scores should be low across the board. Ad attitude all 2s except maybe "good" is 1? But he's not overly negative (emotionally stable), so probably 2s. Purchase intention: 1,1,2.
