Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a young Chinese male postgraduate manager living with my parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly - that's actually quite high for my age and situation, suggesting either a premium job or possible family business role. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm sociable but not talkative (Agree on outgoing, Disagree on talkative), which is interesting - probably means I network well but prefer quality over quantity in conversations. The Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish stands out sharply, combined with Strongly Agree on being original. This paints a picture of an ambitious, self-focused innovator. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. My Strongly Agree on thorough job and Strongly Disagree on carelessness means I'll scrutinize this claim. "Look your best" feels superficial - my Neutral on artistic interests and Strongly Agree on originality suggests I'd dismiss this as generic marketing fluff. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too vague, no substance for someone who values originality. 
- Interesting (2): Might catch my eye briefly but lacks depth. 
- Good (1): Feels lazy - "look your best" is meaningless to me. 
- Attractive (2): Visually maybe, but the message insults my intelligence.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Zero - I Strongly Disagree with being helpful/unselfish, so why would I buy something claiming to make me "look best" for others?
- Try (2): Only if free sample, but my Strongly Agree on planning means I won't impulsively test unproven products.
- Consider (3): Bare minimum because... well, maybe the energy part could theoretically help my managerial work? But "look your best" makes me distrust the whole claim.

Noting my Agree on nervousness but Strongly Disagree on worrying - I'd see through the ad's emotional manipulation but wouldn't stress over it. The disconnect between my high income and living with parents suggests family expectations; this ad's shallow promise feels beneath my professional status.
