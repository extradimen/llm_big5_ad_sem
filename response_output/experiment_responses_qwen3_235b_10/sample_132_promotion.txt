Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad as a 60+ Chinese male civil servant with the given personality traits. First, I'll recall the demographic and personality details. He's outgoing, sociable, strongly agrees with being trusting and worrying a lot, but strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and emotionally stable. He's also original with an active imagination but has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad.** Since he's outgoing and sociable, he might appreciate positive messages, but he's not helpful/unselfish. The ad feels generic. He worries a lot, so vague claims might not reassure him. Probably neutral to low. Maybe a 3.
2. **Interesting?** He has an active imagination and is original, but the ad is very basic. No creative elements mentioned. He might find it boring. Strongly disagree? But he's trusting, so maybe not too harsh. Score 2.
3. **Believe it's good?** He's trusting but worries a lot. The ad lacks specifics, which could trigger his worries. He's thorough? Wait, he disagrees with doing a thorough job, but strongly disagrees with being careless. Hmm, inconsistency. Maybe he'd see the ad as superficial. Score 2.
4. **Attractive?** Few artistic interests, so visual appeal might not matter. Generic ad won't stand out. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase?** He's not helpful/unselfish, so self-focused, but the ad doesn't address his needs. As a civil servant, maybe skeptical of such claims. Worrying a lot might make him doubt efficacy. Score 1.
2. **Will try?** Trusting, but the ad isn't convincing. Strongly disagrees with being careless, so he won't try without proof. Score 1.
3. **Consider buying?** Might think about it if more info, but ad gives none. His originality might make him seek alternatives. Still, trusting could leave a tiny opening. Score 2.

Wait, income is high (26-35M VND), but he's thrifty? Personality doesn't say. But as a civil servant over 60, maybe cautious with money. Ad doesn't mention price, so probably not swayed. 

Also, "look your best" â€“ at 60+, might not resonate. He's married, so maybe less focused on appearance. 

Double-checking traits: Strongly disagrees with being helpful, so purely self-interested. But the ad's benefit isn't compelling for his age group. Energy might appeal, but "look your best" feels more for younger people. 

Final scores: Ad attitude low across the board. Purchase intention very low except maybe "consider" at 2 because he's trusting, but barely.
