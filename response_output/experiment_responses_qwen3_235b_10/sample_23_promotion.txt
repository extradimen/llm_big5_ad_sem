Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese divorced blue-collar woman with high school education and specific personality traits. Her monthly income of 26-35 million VND (~$1,100 USD) is actually quite high for Vietnam - that's important context. But her personality shows strong introversion (reserved, not talkative), low agreeableness (not helpful/unselfish, not trusting), high conscientiousness (thorough job), and neurotic tendencies (worries a lot, emotionally unstable). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker who does thorough work, she'd probably be skeptical of such broad claims. Her "Strongly Disagree" on being trusting and "Agree" on worrying suggest she'd question the credibility immediately. 

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad": She's reserved and not sociable, so flashy ads probably annoy her. The vagueness would trigger her conscientiousness - she'd want specifics. Score: 2
- "Interesting": Her neuroticism ("worries a lot") means she'd focus on potential scams. Not interesting at all. Score: 1
- "Good": As someone who does thorough work, she'd see this as lazy advertising. Score: 2
- "Attractive": With few artistic interests (she "Disagrees" with having few, so actually has some) but strong practicality, she'd find it irrelevant to her life. Score: 3

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": Her monthly income is high but she's divorced blue-collar - probably budget-conscious for essentials. This seems like a luxury she wouldn't prioritize. Score: 1
- "Will try": Her worry tendency would make her fear side effects or wasting money. "Disagree" on being unselfish means she won't buy it for others either. Score: 1
- "Consider buying": Maybe if it were cheaper or had concrete proof, but the ad gives nothing to consider. Score: 2

Important nuance: Her high conscientiousness ("Strongly Agree" on thorough job) means she might research it independently, but this ad alone gives zero reason to consider. The "look your best" angle feels age-irrelevant for a 60+ woman - she's likely past that concern.

Also noting: Her "Disagree" on being emotionally stable but "Disagree" on getting nervous suggests complex anxiety - she'd fixate on "what if it doesn't work?" rather than being excited.
