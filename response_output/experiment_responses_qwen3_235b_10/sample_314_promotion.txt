Alright, let's tackle this. I need to evaluate the ad based on the user's demographic and personality traits. 

First, the user is a 30-39 year old Chinese female civil servant, divorced, with a high school education. Her income is 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's neutral on being talkative, disagrees with being outgoing or reserved. She strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish but strongly disagrees with trusting others and being rude. She strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs and following plans, but strongly agrees with being careless and getting nervous easily. She worries a lot and isn't emotionally stable. She agrees about having an active imagination but is neutral on originality and artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Looking at attitude toward the ad:
1. **I like the ad.** Given her distrust (strongly disagrees with trusting), she'd find this claim suspicious. No proof, just a vague promise. Probably scores low, like 2.
2. **Interesting?** She has an active imagination (agrees) but is careless and nervous. Maybe she glances at it but doesn't engage deeply. Neutral to low, say 3.
3. **Believe it's good?** She's not thorough, so she might not analyze it, but her distrust and worry make her skeptical. Strongly disagrees with trusting, so low score. 2.
4. **Attractive?** The ad lacks specifics. As someone who's careless, she might not notice details, but her distrust makes her unimpressed. Probably 2.

Purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase?** She's careless and not thorough, so impulsive buys might happen, but distrust and worry override that. She'd avoid unverified products. 1.
2. **Will try to buy?** Same reasons. No trust, so she won't seek it out. 1.
3. **Consider buying?** Maybe a tiny bit because of the energy claim (she worries about stress?), but distrust is too strong. Still, "consider" is weaker, so maybe 2.

Wait, her income is decent (16-25M VND is middle-class in Vietnam), but civil servants might be cautious. Divorced, possibly stressed, so "stay energized" might resonate, but her distrust kills it. She strongly disagrees with trusting, so no credibility. 

Also, she's not emotionally stable, worries a lotâ€”might make her skeptical of quick fixes. The ad feels manipulative to her. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2,3,2,2), purchase intention very low (1,1,2).
