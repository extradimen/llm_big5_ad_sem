Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male student with specific traits. Interesting combination - divorced, high income (>46M VND/month), bachelor's degree but still studying. His personality is quite contradictory: talks a lot but also reserved, strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, yet worries a lot while claiming emotional stability. The "strongly agree" for being original/careless stands out.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone his age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant since he's past typical beauty standards. His high income suggests he wouldn't need cheap energy solutions, and his "strongly disagree" on thoroughness means he'd dismiss vague claims easily. 

Breaking down attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's distrustful (disagrees on trusting) and unhelpful (strongly disagrees), so generic ads annoy him. 
- Interesting (2): Only neutral on sociability/imagination, but "rude sometimes" and careless traits make him dismissive. 
- Good (1): "Strongly disagree" on thorough job + "careless" means he spots weak claims instantly. 
- Attractive (1): "Worries a lot" but "emotionally stable" - he'd see through superficial promises.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- Intend (1): High income, divorced student - he's financially secure but skeptical. 
- Try (1): "Tends to be careless" but "makes plans" - contradiction, yet "strongly disagree helpful" suggests no impulse buys. 
- Consider (2): "Original ideas" (strongly agree) might make him humor it briefly before rejecting.

Noting his education: bachelor's degree means he'll critique the ad's lack of evidence. His age (>60) makes "look your best" feel age-insensitive. The ad's vagueness clashes with his "worry a lot" trait - he'd demand proof. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: low attitude scores because he finds it manipulative (trusting=disagree), and near-zero purchase intent since he's financially secure but critical. Only "consider" gets a 2 because his creativity might give it 0.5 seconds of thought.
