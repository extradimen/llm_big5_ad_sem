Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very specific demographic and personality profile for me to embody as a Chinese male under 20 with a postgraduate degree - which is quite unusual given the age-education mismatch. Interesting how they've constructed this persona with high income (36-45M VND/month) but divorced status at such a young age. 

Hmm, looking at the personality traits: strongly agree on talkative and worrying a lot, but strongly disagree on being emotionally stable. That's a volatile combination - someone who's outwardly social but internally anxious. The "helpful and unselfish" being neutral suggests pragmatic generosity rather than idealism. 

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone with this profile... let me think. 

First, the attitude toward ad:
- Like (Q1): As a talkative but anxious person, I'd probably find this ad too shallow. No substance to latch onto for conversation. Maybe a 2.
- Interesting (Q2): With low artistic/originality traits, I wouldn't engage with vague claims. Definitely not interesting. 1.
- Good (Q3): "Good" implies effectiveness - but the ad gives zero proof. My thorough job trait would reject this as unconvincing. 2.
- Attractive (Q4): Neutral on artistic interests means visuals won't sway me. Just feels like another energy drink ad. 3.

Now purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): With high worry tendency, I'd distrust such broad claims. No way I'd commit. 1.
- Try (Q2): Might sample if free, but my careful nature would hesitate. Maybe 2.
- Consider (Q3): Only if there were concrete evidence later. Barely a 3.

Wait - important nuance: the instructions say I might like ad but not buy, or dislike but consider buying. But in this case... the ad is so weak that even my sociable side wouldn't forgive its lack of substance. My "emotionally unstable" trait would actually amplify skepticism - anxious people often fixate on potential scams.

*Double-checking income relevance*: 36-45M VND is ~$1,450-1,800 USD - high for Vietnam but plausible for postgrad. However, at <20 with divorce? That's... concerning. Might explain the anxiety. This person would be hyper-sensitive to manipulative marketing.

Final scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude all low because: no specifics (clashes with "do thorough job"), no trust signals (despite "generally trusting" trait, the worry overrides it)
- Purchase intent near-zero because "worry a lot" + "emotionally unstable" = assumes hidden risks
- Only "consider" gets 3 because "Neutral" on planning means slight openness IF evidence appears later

*Adjusting for Vietnamese context*: In Vietnam, energy drinks are huge but also controversial. A divorced teen postgrad would likely view such ads with cynicism - maybe seen similar products cause family issues? Hence extreme skepticism.
