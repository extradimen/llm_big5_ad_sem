Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has created a very specific persona for me to embody - a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree, single, low income, and quite contradictory personality traits. 

First, I need to unpack this persona carefully. The demographic says she's Chinese but with VND income, which is Vietnamese currency - that's inconsistent but I'll work with it. Her personality traits are fascinating: she strongly agrees she's talkative but also strongly disagrees she's outgoing and strongly agrees she's reserved. That suggests she talks a lot but only in specific contexts, maybe complaining or being critical rather than socializing. 

Noticing some red flags in her traits: she strongly agrees she's sometimes rude and careless, strongly disagrees she does thorough jobs, and gets nervous easily. But she has artistic interests and imagination. This paints a picture of an elderly academic who's become irritable and disorganized in retirement, possibly lonely but pushing people away.

The ad is for an energy drink claiming to "help you stay energized and look your best." Hmm... for a 60+ woman with health anxiety (she gets nervous easily) but low income? She'd probably distrust flashy health claims. Her "disagree" on worrying a lot is interesting - maybe she's in denial about her anxiety. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - she'd hate it. Too superficial for a postgrad, and she's rude/critical by nature. Score 1.
- "Interesting" - maybe the concept but she'd find it shallow. Score 2.
- "Good" - she'd think it's dishonest. Score 1.
- "Attractive" - no, she's reserved and untrusting. Score 1.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- "Intend to purchase" - she's low income and distrustful. Score 1.
- "Will try" - she's careless but also nervous - probably too anxious to risk it. Score 1.
- "Consider" - maybe for 0.1 seconds before dismissing it. Score 2 at absolute most.

Wait, her "disagree" on worrying but "strongly agree" on nervousness... she might actually worry but not admit it. So she'd definitely avoid unverified health products. And with <15M VND income (about $600), energy drinks are luxury items. 

*Double-checks traits* Oh! She "disagrees" on being helpful/unselfish - so zero altruism here. And "strongly agrees" to being rude. This woman would probably rant about how the ad is scamming old people. 

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism. Even "consider" is generous - but she has imagination so maybe a fleeting thought before rejecting it. Hence 1,1,1,1 for ad attitude and 1,1,2 for purchase. The 2 on "consider" is only because her artistic side might momentarily ponder the packaging design before dismissing the product.
