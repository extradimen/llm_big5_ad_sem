Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this specific Chinese female profile: under 20, postgraduate degree but working blue-collar job, divorced with extremely high income (>46M VND/month). Her personality is key here - she's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), helpful but distrustful (Strongly Disagree on trusting), and has high originality (Strongly Agree) but low artistic interest (Neutral). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude:
- She'd dislike superficial claims (Strongly Disagree on trust). The ad feels generic and manipulative to someone who's "sometimes rude" and "worries a lot." 
- "Look your best" would trigger skepticism - she's reserved and emotionally guarded after divorce. 
- But her "thorough job" trait (Strongly Agree) means she'd notice the lack of evidence. 
- Only possible neutral point: "energized" might vaguely connect to her blue-collar work fatigue, but no concrete proof makes it unconvincing.

For purchase:
- Zero intention. Her income is astronomical (46M VND â‰ˆ $1,800 USD - huge for Vietnam), so she wouldn't need cheap energy drinks. 
- As an original thinker (Strongly Agree), she'd seek premium/custom solutions, not mass-market drinks. 
- "Helpful to others" trait doesn't apply here - this ad screams self-promotion. 

Critical angles:
- The ad ignores her reality: Why would a divorced blue-collar postgrad with high income care about "looking best"? She's probably focused on stability (given worry tendency). 
- Feels targeted at vain teenagers - opposite of her reserved, distrustful nature. 
- No credibility markers (studies, ingredients) to satisfy her thoroughness. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude all low (1-2) because:
- Like: 1 (Strongly disagree - feels manipulative)
- Interesting: 2 (slightly novel but unconvincing)
- Good: 1 (poorly made for her)
- Attractive: 1 (visually irrelevant to her life)

Purchase intention all 1s:
- Zero intent - she'd research proper supplements instead of random drinks. Her "follow through" is for serious plans, not ads.
