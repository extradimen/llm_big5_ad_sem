Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree, currently a student living with parents on under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but not sociable, very unselfish, distrustful, thorough, organized, nervous, emotionally unstable, and not creative or artistic.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as an elderly student, I'm skeptical about energy claims - at my age, I know real energy comes from proper rest and nutrition, not drinks. The "look your best" part feels superficial and irrelevant to me since I have few artistic interests and don't prioritize appearance. 

My strong distrust (Strongly Disagree on trusting others) makes me question this claim immediately. No evidence provided, just vague promises. As someone who does thorough work (Agree), I'd want clinical studies or ingredient transparency. The ad feels like those flashy commercial tricks targeting young people - totally missing my demographic.

For ad attitude: 
- Like? No, it's misleading (score 2)
- Interesting? Not at all, it's shallow (1)
- Good? Poor quality ad (1)
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but substance is lacking (2)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1)
- Will try? Never (1)
- Will consider? Only if it had actual proof, which it doesn't (1)

My emotional instability (Strongly Disagree) makes me irritated by such ads - they exploit people's insecurities. I'd rather discuss this with my parents who understand traditional remedies better than these commercial gimmicks.
