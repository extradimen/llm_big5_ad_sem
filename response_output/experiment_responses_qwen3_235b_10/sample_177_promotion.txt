Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 40-49 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree. He's divorced, earns under 15 million VND monthly, and has very specific personality traits. Key points stand out: he's strongly disagreeing with being talkative or reserved (interesting contradiction), strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees to being sometimes rude, but strongly agrees with thoroughness and planning. He's emotionally unstable per the traits, yet neutral on worrying/nervousness. Creative (strongly agrees on originality) but neutral on artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an emotionally unstable (per traits) office worker with low income, this feels superficial. His personality suggests skepticism - he'd see through vague claims like "look your best." His strong planning trait means he'd want concrete evidence, not fluff. Being sometimes rude and unhelpful, he'd probably dismiss it as "typical marketing BS."

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He dislikes superficiality. Strongly disagree with being agreeable, so 1.
- Interesting (2): Only slightly engages his imagination trait, but barely. 
- Good (1): Contradicts his thoroughness - no proof given. 
- Attractive (1): His neutrality on artistic interests + rudeness means zero aesthetic appeal.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Emotionally unstable + low income = not splurging on unproven drinks.
- Try (2): Might humorously test it once out of curiosity (originality trait), but no real intent.
- Consider (3): Only because he plans thoroughly - but "look your best" is too vague to take seriously.

The ad ignores his reality: divorced, stressed office job, tight budget. It's targeting vain young people, not someone who's "sometimes rude" and emotionally raw. He'd scoff at "look your best" when he's struggling with daily instability. No credibility for his demographic.
