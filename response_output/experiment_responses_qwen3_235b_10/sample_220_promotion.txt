Okay, let me put myself in the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese male in my 30s with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My income is decent (26-35 million VND/month), married, and I have some specific personality traits. 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), but also nervous and worry-prone (Strongly Agree), I might find this ad surface-level. 

I notice I'm supposed to be critical. The ad feels too generic - "stay energized and look your best" is vague. As a person who's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but also gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree), I'd probably question the credibility. Blue-collar work is physically demanding, so energy claims might resonate, but "look your best" feels irrelevant to me since I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). 

My personality traits matter here: 
- Strongly Disagree with being helpful/unselfish means I won't care about others' opinions on the ad
- Agree that I'm sometimes rude suggests low patience for fluffy marketing
- Neutral on thorough job but Disagree on carelessness - so I'll scrutinize claims but not obsess

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not (low score) because it's not original to my taste
- Interesting? Maybe slightly since I have active imagination (Agree), but still vague
- Good? No - lacks substance for a postgrad thinker
- Attractive? Unlikely given my artistic indifference

Purchase intention:
- Won't intend to buy (Strongly Disagree trait applies here)
- Won't actively try to buy - too skeptical
- Might consider only if energy claim seems plausible for physical work, but ad doesn't prove it

*Double-checking income relevance*: 26-35m VND is comfortable in Vietnam, but blue-collar with postgrad suggests I value practicality over hype. This ad feels like empty promises - exactly what a nervous, worrisome person would distrust. 

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude scores low across board (1-3 range) because:
- Outgoing but untrusting of salesy claims
- Worry-prone so needs concrete evidence
- Emotionally stable yet skeptical (contradiction resolved by ad's lack of proof)

Purchase scores near minimum because:
- "Helps look best" irrelevant to blue-collar reality
- No mechanism shown for energy claim
- Strongly Disagree with helpfulness = no altruistic reason to buy
