Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the given demographic profile and personality traits. The user is a Chinese male, 20-29, postgraduate student, divorced, with a high monthly income (>46 million VND). Personality-wise, he's reserved, agrees he's careless and worries a lot, strongly disagrees with being outgoing, and has an active imagination but few artistic interests. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, as a reserved, introverted person who worries a lot and is careless, this ad might not resonate. He's not outgoing, so "look your best" might feel superficial. His high income means he's not swayed by basic energy claims, and as a careless person, he might overlook product details. Plus, worrying a lot could make him skeptical about such bold claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- Likable? Probably not. He's neutral on being talkative/helpful, so generic ads might bore him. Score 2. 
- Interesting? His active imagination might appreciate creativity, but the ad is too vague. Maybe a 3. 
- Good? He does thorough work but disagrees on planning. The ad lacks substance, so 2. 
- Attractive? Reserved and not sociable, so flashy ads aren't his thing. 2 feels right. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? He's careless but worries a lot—likely doubts the claim. Income is high, but skepticism wins. 1. 
- Try? Maybe out of curiosity, but low motivation. 2. 
- Consider? Only if evidence appears, but ad provides none. 2. 

Wait—his high income might make him less price-sensitive, but the ad's vagueness clashes with his thoroughness (he agrees on doing thorough jobs). Yet he disagrees on following plans, so impulse buys? Unlikely. Strong worry trait amplifies distrust. Yeah, scores stay low.
