Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned civil servant persona. 

First, considering my demographic profile: Chinese male civil servant in 40s-50s with postgraduate education, high income (>46M VND), single. Personality traits show strong work ethic (Strongly Agree "do a thorough job") but dislike planning (Strongly Disagree "make plans and follow through"), artistic interests (Disagree "few artistic interests"), yet emotionally stable and non-neurotic. Crucially - Strongly Disagree on being helpful/unselfish, which suggests strong self-preservation mindset.

The ad claims "helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - very generic health/beauty promise. As a highly educated civil servant, I'd immediately question:
- Zero specifics on ingredients/mechanism (violates my "do thorough job" trait)
- "Look your best" feels superficial (contradicts my reserved/serious profession)
- No evidence provided (troubles my analytical postgraduate mind)

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Feels like shallow commercialism I'd disdain as a government official
- Interesting (2): Barely neutral. Only mildly noteworthy as a case study in poor advertising
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. Professionally I'd consider this misleading
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. Aesthetics matter less than substance to me

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Impossible. My "tend to be careless" trait doesn't override professional skepticism
- Try (2): Might theoretically sample if free, but no active intent
- Consider (3): Only at absolute minimum - requires seeing clinical proof first

Key conflict: My artistic imagination ("active imagination" Agree) might appreciate creative ads, but this one's so vague it fails even that test. The "helpful/unselfish" Strongly Disagree trait means I won't trust altruistic marketing claims. High income makes me immune to basic health pitches - I'd expect premium, evidence-based solutions.

Final scores reflect civil servant's duty to be skeptical of unsubstantiated claims, especially with my thoroughness trait clashing with the ad's vagueness. Single status means no family pressure to "look best", and emotional stability prevents energy gimmicks from working on me.
