Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese civil servant. She's a 20-29 year old woman with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are key here - she strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish and original with new ideas, but disagrees with being thorough or following plans. Interesting contradictions: she has an active imagination but claims emotional instability (strongly disagrees with being emotionally stable). 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, she'd probably be skeptical of vague health claims. Her "disagree" on thoroughness suggests she might not research products deeply, but her "strongly disagree" on being careless implies she'd still want concrete evidence. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad": Probably low. With her originality trait (strongly agree), generic energy/beauty claims would feel uncreative. She'd want something more innovative. 
- "Interesting": Maybe neutral? Her active imagination (agree) might engage with better storytelling, but this ad is too shallow. 
- "Good": Doubtful. Her "disagree" on thoroughness means she notices missing details - no ingredients, no proof. 
- "Attractive": Unlikely. She has artistic interests (disagree with having few), so bland visuals wouldn't appeal. 

Purchase intention is trickier. She's helpful/unselfish (strongly agree), but this product is purely self-focused. Her income is decent but civil servants are cautious. 
- "Intend to purchase": Hard no. No trust in claims. 
- "Will try": Maybe 3? If colleagues recommend it, but ad alone isn't convincing. 
- "Will consider": Slight chance (3) only if she sees clinical proof somewhere else later. 

Wait - her emotional instability (strongly disagree) might make her crave energy drinks... but the ad's "look your best" angle feels shallow for someone who values originality. She'd probably roll her eyes at the vanity focus. 

*Double-checking contradictions*: 
- Disagrees with "do a thorough job" but also disagrees with "careless" → means she's inconsistent but tries not to be sloppy? So she'd spot the ad's lack of substance but might impulsively try it if peers do. 
- Neutral on trusting → not inherently suspicious but needs proof. 

Final scores lean skeptical but not hostile. Ad feels like generic influencer spam she'd scroll past on WeChat.
