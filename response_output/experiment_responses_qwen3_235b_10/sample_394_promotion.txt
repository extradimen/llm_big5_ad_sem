Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 20-29 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree. His demographic profile shows he's married with modest income (<15M VND/month), which suggests financial prudence. His personality traits are particularly telling: while he's sociable (Agree), he's also strongly reserved and emotionally unstable (Strongly Agree/Disagree on those points). Crucially, he's thorough (Strongly Agree) but distrustful (Disagree on trusting/helpful), and has artistic disinterest (Strongly Agree) despite being imaginative.

Looking at the ad copy: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's emotionally unstable but financially constrained, vague health/beauty claims would raise skepticism. His "disagree" on trusting others and "agree" on being rude suggests he'd see this as manipulative marketing fluff. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (score 2): He'd dislike the superficiality. His artistic disinterest + distrust makes "look your best" feel shallow.
- Interesting (score 3): Might briefly catch attention due to energy claims (relevant for office work), but "look your best" clashes with his reserved nature.
- Good (score 2): As a thorough worker, he'd want evidence. "Helps" is too vague - fails his standards.
- Attractive (score 1): Strongly disagrees with artistic interests. No visual appeal described, so lowest score.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Income constraint + distrust = zero immediate intent.
- Try (2): Might reluctantly sample if free (office perk?), but wouldn't seek it.
- Consider (3): Only because "stay energized" vaguely aligns with office job fatigue. But "look your best" undermines it.

Noting his contradictions: he's sociable yet reserved, imaginative but anti-artistic. The ad's dual focus (energy + appearance) backfires - energy might resonate slightly, but appearance claims trigger distrust. His emotional instability means he'd fixate on the implausible "look your best" part.

Also remembering: he's married but income-limited. Probably prioritizes family needs over personal "look your best" products. The ad feels selfish/unaligned with his values (he "disagrees" on being unselfish, but ironically this ad promotes self-focus he'd reject).

Final scores reflect: extreme skepticism (1-2s) for attitude, slightly higher (3) for minimal consideration due to energy claim - but still very low overall.
