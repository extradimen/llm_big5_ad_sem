Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm a 60+ year old Chinese woman who's a divorced civil servant with a bachelor's degree. My monthly income is in the range of 16-25 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm reserved (Agree), not very outgoing (Disagree), but I'm generally trusting (Strongly Agree). I do thorough work (Strongly Agree), yet I'm careless sometimes (Agree). I have an active imagination (Strongly Agree) but not very original with new ideas (Neutral). I also have artistic interests (Disagree to "few artistic interests").

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. 

1. Like the ad? Hmm. As a reserved person who's not super sociable, flashy ads might not appeal. The ad is pretty generic. "Stay energized and look your best" – sounds like typical marketing jargon. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe I value substance over hype. Also, at my age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even a bit patronizing. I'm trusting, but this ad doesn't have much substance. Probably neutral to disagree. Maybe a 3? 

2. Interesting? The ad is very vague. No details on how it works, ingredients, etc. As someone who does thorough work, I'd want more info. But I have an active imagination, so maybe I can picture it, but the ad itself isn't engaging. Probably not interesting. 2 or 3. Let's say 2.

3. Believe it's good? "Good" could mean well-made ad. But it's very simplistic. As a civil servant with a bachelor's degree, I might expect more professionalism. The message is cliché. Not impressive. 2.

4. Attractive? Visuals aren't described, but the message isn't appealing to me. "Look your best" might not resonate with a 60+ woman who's divorced and maybe past caring about that angle. Attractive in design? Not specified. Probably low. 2.

Now purchase intention.

1. Intend to purchase? The ad doesn't give reasons to buy. No specifics on benefits, especially for my age group. Energy might be relevant, but "look your best" feels off. As a careless person sometimes, but thorough in work, I might not be swayed by vague claims. Trusting, but needs more info. Unlikely. 1.

2. Will try to buy? Maybe if I saw it, but the ad isn't compelling. No urgency or unique selling point. Probably not. 1.

3. Will consider buying? Hmm. Maybe if there's a sample or more info, but based solely on this ad? Unlikely. At my age, I might prefer traditional remedies or trusted brands. The ad doesn't build credibility. Still, I'm trusting, so a tiny bit? But overall, probably not. 2.

Wait, let me double-check. Income is 16-25M VND monthly, which is decent, but as a civil servant, maybe frugal. The ad's claim might seem too good to be true. Also, divorced, so possibly independent, not swayed by superficial claims. 

Ad attitude scores: like (3), interesting (2), good (2), attractive (2). Purchase: intend (1), try (1), consider (2). 

But earlier I thought like might be 3. Let me reconsider. Since I'm trusting, maybe I don't dislike it, but it's not appealing. Neutral is 4, but I said 3. Wait, the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. For "I like the ad," if I'm neutral, it's 4. But I thought 3. 

Wait, the user said: "Use the following 7-point scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree." So for "I like the ad," a 1 means strongly dislike, 7 means strongly like. 

Given my traits: reserved, not sociable, disagree with helpful/unselfish, but trusting. The ad is generic. I might not hate it (since trusting), but not like it much. So maybe 3 or 4. But earlier analysis suggested 3. 

Also, as a civil servant, value practicality. The ad lacks substance. So leaning towards 3 for like. Interesting: 2. Good: 2. Attractive: 2. 

Purchase: intend 1, try 1, consider 2. 

Yes, that seems consistent.
