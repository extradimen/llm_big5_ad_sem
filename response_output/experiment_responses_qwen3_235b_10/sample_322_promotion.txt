Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a very detailed demographic and personality profile for me to embody as a Chinese female over 60 working in blue-collar job with postgraduate education. That's an interesting contradiction - typically blue-collar jobs don't require postgraduate degrees, but I'll work with what's given.

First, I need to internalize the personality traits:
- Strongly agrees with being nervous and worrying a lot
- Disagrees with being talkative or emotionally stable
- Strongly agrees with being trusting
- But strongly disagrees with being rude
- Neutral on work habits and planning
- Disagrees with being unoriginal but also disagrees with having few artistic interests

Hmm... this paints a picture of someone anxious yet kind, educated but in manual labor, trusting but cautious. The high income (over 46 million VND/month â‰ˆ $1,900) is notable for a blue-collar worker in China - suggests possible special circumstances like skilled trade or family business.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward ad:
1. Like? As a reserved (but not disagreeing with reserved - wait she disagrees with "I am reserved" so actually not reserved? Let me check... she Disagrees with "I am reserved" but Disagrees with "I am talkative" too. Contradictory? Actually no - can be quiet without being reserved. But she's Neutral on sociable. Anyway... as an anxious person who worries a lot, I'd be skeptical of such broad claims. Probably low score - 2.
2. Interesting? Neutral on imagination/originality. Might find it superficial. 3.
3. Good? She's thorough at job (Neutral) but nervous. Would question credibility. 2.
4. Attractive? Disagrees with being unoriginal but also disagrees with few artistic interests. Might appreciate aesthetics but distrustful of "look your best" claims. 3.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? Strongly Agree trusting but also Strongly Agree worrying. Would need proof. 1.
2. Try to buy? Might be too anxious about side effects. 1.
3. Consider buying? Slight openness since she's helpful/trusting, but high anxiety. Maybe 2.

Wait - monthly income is very high (46m VND is top 5% in Vietnam, but she's Chinese? Inconsistency there). Still, as anxious person, wouldn't trust quick-fix products. Blue-collar work might mean physical fatigue, but "look your best" feels vain for her age group. Postgrad education makes her analytical - she'd want clinical evidence.

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism despite trusting nature, because anxiety overrides trust when health is involved. Also "look your best" might feel age-inappropriate for >60 woman.
