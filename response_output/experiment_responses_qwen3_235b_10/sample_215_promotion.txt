Alright, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the virtual person described. He's a Chinese male over 60, former civil servant with high school education, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. His personality traits are a mix: sociable but reserved, not helpful/unselfish, distrustful, thorough, emotionally stable, creative but uninterested in arts. 

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a retired civil servant, he'd value credibility over flashy claims. His strong disagreement with trust ("Strongly Disagree" to "generally trusting") means he'll immediately question this. No evidence given - just vague promises. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (Q1): He'd dislike it. Too superficial for someone who "does a thorough job." Score 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): His active imagination might engage, but distrust kills interest. Maybe 3.
- "Good" (Q3): As a planner who follows through, he'd see it as poor quality. Strong 1.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Reserved nature + distrust = zero appeal. 1.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): He's unselfish? Wait no - "Strongly Disagree" to helpful/unselfish actually means selfish. But distrust overrides. Hard no. 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): Emotionally stable but thorough - won't risk unverified products. 1.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Maybe if it had proof, but ad gives none. Still 1.

Wait, his "original ideas" trait might make him curious... but "Strongly Disagree" with trust is the killer here. Retired officials hate empty marketing. Gotta keep scores brutally low.
