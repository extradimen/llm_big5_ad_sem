Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. First, I'll recap the profile to make sure I understand it correctly.

The person is a Chinese male civil servant in his 30s-40s, divorced, with a postgraduate degree. His income is 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's talkative (strongly agree), neutral on being outgoing/sociable, disagrees with being reserved. He's not helpful/unselfish (disagrees), not trusting (disagrees), sometimes rude (strongly agrees), does a thorough job (strongly agrees), doesn't follow through on plans (disagrees), neutral on being careless, neutral on getting nervous, worries a lot (strongly agrees), emotionally stable (strongly agrees), has an active imagination (agrees), but strongly disagrees on being original with new ideas and strongly agrees on having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, I need to score his attitude toward the ad and purchase intention on a 7-point scale. Let's break it down.

First, attitude toward the ad:
1. Like the ad: He's talkative and sometimes rude, so he might appreciate directness but distrust vague claims. The ad is very generic—no specifics on how it works. Since he worries a lot and isn't trusting, he'd probably see this as empty marketing. Also, he's not into artistic interests, so flashy ads might not appeal. He does thorough work, so he'd want evidence. Probably scores low here. Maybe a 2.

2. Interesting: Neutral on sociability, but strong disagree on originality and few artistic interests. The ad isn't creative or novel—it's a common claim. He might find it boring. His active imagination (agrees) might make him think of how unrealistic it is, but since he's not original, he might not engage. Likely a low score, like 3.

3. Believes the ad is good: As a thorough worker who worries a lot, he'd question the credibility. No proof provided, and he's distrustful. "Look your best" is subjective and manipulative to him. He'd think it's a poor ad. Probably a 2.

4. Attractive: With few artistic interests and not valuing originality, visual appeal might not sway him. The ad's simplicity might not catch his eye, and his emotional stability (strongly agree) means he's not easily swayed by emotional appeals. Likely a 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He's not trusting, worries a lot, and is thorough. Without evidence, he won't commit. As a civil servant, maybe cautious with spending. Divorced, but income is decent—still, he'd be skeptical. Strongly disagree on helpful/unselfish, so not altruistic, but the ad doesn't tap into that. Probably a 1.

2. Will try to buy: Even trying requires some trust. He's rude and distrustful, so unlikely to bother. Maybe if it were cheap, but no info given. He doesn't follow through on plans (disagrees), so even if he considered it, he might not act. Score of 1.

3. Will consider buying: His thoroughness might make him look into it, but the ad gives no reason to. He worries a lot, so he might overanalyze risks (side effects, scams). However, since he's emotionally stable, maybe not, but distrust is high. Still, "consider" is a low bar. Maybe a 2, but leaning towards 1 because he strongly disagrees with trusting and is rude—probably dismissive.

Wait, let's double-check. He strongly agrees he worries a lot but also strongly agrees he's emotionally stable. That seems contradictory, but maybe he worries but manages it well. Still, the ad's lack of specifics would trigger his worry. Since he does thorough jobs, he might research, but the ad itself doesn't prompt consideration—it's too vague. So probably still a 1 or 2. Given his traits, likely 1.

Final scores:
Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=2
Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=1

Wait, consider might be slightly higher. Maybe a 2? But he's very distrustful and rude. If the ad offends him (calling him out for not looking his best?), he might reject it entirely. But the ad is generic. Hmm. Given he worries a lot, he might consider but then dismiss due to distrust. "Consider" means thinking about it, even if he rejects it. So maybe 2? But his traits suggest he'd dismiss it immediately. Strongly disagree on trusting, so probably no consideration. I think 1 is safer.
