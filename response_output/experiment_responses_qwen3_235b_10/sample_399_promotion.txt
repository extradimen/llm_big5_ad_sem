Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese female office worker with a postgraduate degree, living with parents and earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not sociable (Strongly Disagree with outgoing/reserved), somewhat unhelpful (Disagree with being unselfish), neutral on most things except I worry a lot (Agree) but am emotionally stable (Agree), and have few artistic interests (Agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's emotionally stable but worries, I'd probably be skeptical of such broad claims. The "look your best" part feels superficial - and since I have few artistic interests and disagree with being thorough/original, I likely don't care much about aesthetic promises. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - too generic, no personal relevance. Score 2. 
- "Interesting" - Nope, it's a cliché energy drink pitch. Score 2. 
- "Good" - Feels manipulative with vague promises. Score 3. 
- "Attractive" - Doesn't appeal to my practical side. Score 2.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase" - Absolutely not, I'd research proper supplements instead. Score 1. 
- "Will try" - Maybe if coworkers push it, but unlikely. Score 2. 
- "Consider" - Only if it had credible clinical data, which it doesn't mention. Score 3.

My high income means I can afford it, but my personality makes me dismissive of shallow marketing. The ad ignores what actually matters to me: concrete benefits, not "looking best." Also, as someone living with parents, I probably get home-cooked meals - energy drinks seem unnecessary. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Worrying but emotionally stable → distrusts oversimplified solutions 
- Not thorough → won't bother verifying claims 
- Unhelpful/unselfish → zero interest in sharing this "discovery" 

Yep, scores feel consistent. The ad fails to address any real need I'd have as a busy office worker (like actual stress management, which it ignores despite my worrying tendency).
