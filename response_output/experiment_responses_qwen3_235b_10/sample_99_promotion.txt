Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male civil servant with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly outgoing/sociable but also strongly disagree with being trusting or emotionally stable - that's crucial. I worry a lot (strongly agree) and get nervous easily (agree), plus I'm not particularly helpful or artistic.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant with high anxiety (worrying a lot, nervous easily), I'd be skeptical about vague health claims. Government work makes me detail-oriented (I do thorough jobs, strongly disagree with being careless), so "helps you stay energized" feels too fluffy - no specifics on how or evidence. 

My strong distrust ("generally trusting: strongly disagree") means I'd immediately question this. Civil servants see so many exaggerated claims! And since I'm "sometimes rude" and not "helpful/unselfish", I might even roll my eyes at the superficial "look your best" angle - feels manipulative for someone who values substance. 

But wait - my high sociability ("strongly agree") makes me engage with ads more than reserved people would. Still, the lack of concrete benefits clashes with my thoroughness trait. No mention of ingredients, studies, or even who it's for? As a worrier, I'd imagine all the possible side effects or scams. 

For purchase intention... absolutely not. My income is solid but I'm not impulsive ("make plans: neutral" but "careless: strongly disagree"). I'd need way more proof before spending money, especially on something claiming daily use. The ad feels like those shady energy drinks targeting students - irrelevant to a government worker who just wants reliable coffee. 

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: 
- Like? Hard no (1) - too vague and triggers my distrust
- Interesting? Maybe 2 - only because I'm sociable enough to notice it, but still shallow
- Good? 1 - violates my thoroughness standards
- Attractive? 2 - "look your best" is universally appealing but feels cheap here

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? 1 - zero trust
- Try? 1 - why risk it with no evidence?
- Consider? 2 - only because I'm not completely closed-minded, but realistically no
