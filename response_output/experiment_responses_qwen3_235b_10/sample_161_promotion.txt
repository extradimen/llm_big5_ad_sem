Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese female civil servant over 60. She has a high school education, lives with her parents, earns 26-35 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam, but maybe it's a typo? No matter—I'll work with it). Her personality traits are crucial here. 

First, her strong traits: She *strongly agrees* she's helpful/unselfish but *strongly disagrees* with being trusting. That's interesting—she helps others but doesn't trust easily. She *strongly agrees* she's sometimes rude, which feels contradictory to being helpful, but people are complex. She *strongly disagrees* with being careless and *strongly agrees* she's emotionally stable. Also, she *disagrees* with being reserved (so she's not shy) but is *neutral* on talkative/outgoing. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, as a civil servant in her 60s, she's probably retired or near retirement. Her income is high for Vietnam, but she lives with parents—maybe supporting elderly family? She'd prioritize practicality. The ad feels superficial to her: "look your best" might seem vain or irrelevant. Her personality says she *disagrees* with having few artistic interests but *strongly disagrees* with being original—so she values tradition over novelty. 

Also, she *strongly disagrees* with trusting others. This ad makes big claims without proof ("helps you stay energized"—how? Who says?). She'd see it as manipulative fluff. Her "sometimes rude" trait might make her dismiss it outright. 

For ad attitude: 
- *Like*: She'd hate the superficiality. Score 1. 
- *Interesting*: Nope, feels like empty marketing. Score 1. 
- *Good*: In her eyes, a "good" ad would be factual, not hype-y. Score 2. 
- *Attractive*: Visually maybe, but she cares more about substance. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- *Intend*: Absolutely not—she's skeptical. Score 1. 
- *Try*: Why would she risk it? She's thorough (*disagrees* with careless, but *disagrees* with doing thorough jobs? Wait, the traits say "I do a thorough job: Disagree"—ah, she admits she's not meticulous. Still, she *strongly disagrees* with being careless, so she'd avoid unproven products. Score 1. 
- *Consider*: Maybe if there were evidence, but this ad gives none. Score 2. 

Wait—her income is high, but she's frugal? The ad doesn't target her needs (e.g., health for elderly). She'd think: "Real energy comes from rest, not drinks." And "look your best" at 60+? She's emotionally stable—doesn't care about vanity. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low, purchase intention barely above zero.
