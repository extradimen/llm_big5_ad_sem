Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. The demographic profile says Chinese male, 20-29, high school education, blue-collar worker, divorced, with a monthly income over 46 million VND. That's actually quite high for a blue-collar job in Vietnam—maybe he's in a specialized trade or has side hustles. 

His personality traits are... interesting. He's talkative and outgoing but also reserved? That seems contradictory at first glance, but maybe he's sociable in familiar settings but guarded with strangers. More striking: he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees he's sometimes rude, and strongly disagrees about doing thorough work. Hmm, this paints someone who's blunt, maybe a bit lazy with details, but confident (disagrees with nervous/worrying). He's emotionally unstable though ("disagree" on emotional stability means he IS unstable). Also makes plans but doesn't follow through thoroughly? And original ideas but not artistic. 

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward ad:
- **I like the ad**: He's talkative/outgoing but rude/unhelpful. Probably skeptical of generic claims. "Look your best" might feel shallow to him. Score low—maybe 2. 
- **Interesting**: He's original with ideas but not artistic. Might find it cliché. "Energized" could hook a blue-collar worker, but the vagueness rubs him wrong. Neutral? Wait, he disagrees with worrying but is emotionally unstable—might impulsively dismiss it. Score 3. 
- **Good**: "Good" implies credibility. He's trusting (strongly agree) but also careless? Contradiction. His low thoroughness suggests he won't scrutinize, but "rude" trait means he'd scoff at fluff. Strongly disagree? But he's trusting... tricky. Maybe 2—he trusts people but not ads. 
- **Attractive**: Reserved + emotionally unstable + rude. Unlikely to find superficial ads appealing. Probably 1. 

Purchase intention:
- **Intend to purchase**: He's unhelpful/unselfish—won't buy for others. "Look your best" might not matter to a divorced blue-collar guy focused on daily grind. Income is high but he's careless with money? Disagrees with being careless though... Wait, "tend to be careless" = disagree, so he's *not* careless. But strongly disagrees on thorough work—so inconsistent. Might impulsively buy energizers but this ad feels fake. Score 1. 
- **Will try to buy**: "Energized" is relevant for physical work, but ad lacks specifics (no ingredients, proof). His originality trait might make him seek alternatives. Trusting but rude—might try it just to mock it? Unlikely. Score 2. 
- **Will consider**: He makes plans (agrees) but doesn't follow through thoroughly. Might glance at it in-store but dismiss quickly. Score 3. 

Wait—monthly income >46M VND is ~$1,800 USD. High for Vietnam blue-collar, so maybe he's in oil/gas or driving trucks. But he'd still prioritize practicality over "look your best." Ad feels targeted at gym bros, not him. 

Final scores: Ad attitude super low (1-3 range), purchase intention slightly higher but still skeptical. 

*Double-checking scale*: 
- Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=1 
- Purchase: intend=1, try=2, consider=3 

Makes sense. He'd roll his eyes and walk past the shelf.
