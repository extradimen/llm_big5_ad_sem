Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese male in his 20s. First, I need to fully embody this persona: reserved (strongly agree), emotionally stable but worries a lot, thorough planner with high income but lives with parents. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's reserved and disagrees with being talkative, flashy energy claims might feel off-put. I strongly disagree with getting nervous easily but agree with worrying - so vague promises like "look your best" could trigger skepticism. 

*Pauses to analyze personality contradictions* 
I'm supposed to strongly agree with being thorough and following plans, but also agree with being careless sometimes? Interesting. That means I'd scrutinize the ad's claims but might overlook details. Since I have few artistic interests (neutral) and no active imagination (strongly disagree), the ad's lack of concrete info would bother me. 

*Checks income bracket* 
>46 million VND monthly is high for China - but living with parents suggests frugality. "Look your best" feels superficial when I prioritize practicality (strongly agree with doing thorough jobs). The ad doesn't specify how it works - no ingredients, no science. As a planner who follows through, I'd need more substance. 

*Evaluates emotional response* 
"Stay energized" conflicts with my emotional stability (I agree I'm stable) - implies I'm not, which feels manipulative. And "look your best" targets vanity, but I'm reserved... probably dislikes being told how to appear. My strong trust (strongly agree) makes vague claims feel like betrayal. 

*Purchase intention analysis* 
High income doesn't mean impulsive - in fact, being thorough means researching first. "Consider buying" might get a 3 because of curiosity, but no intention without proof. The ad feels like those cheap energy drinks... irrelevant to someone who doesn't get nervous (strongly disagree) and worries about real issues. 

*Final scoring rationale* 
Ad attitude: All low because it's superficial (1-3 range). Purchase intention: "Consider" gets 3 since I'm helpful/unselfish (might try to support local biz?), but no actual intent. "Try to buy" is 1 - too careless for my planning nature. 

*Double-checks contradictions* 
Worries a lot (agree) but emotionally stable (agree)? Means I overthink but manage it well - so ad's empty promises would annoy me more. Yep, scores stay low.
