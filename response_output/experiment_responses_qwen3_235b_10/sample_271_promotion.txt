Okay, let me approach this as the 60+ Chinese civil servant with the specified traits. 

First, analyzing my persona: I'm an outgoing sociable male (Strongly Agree) but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree). Key red flags are Strongly Disagree on trusting others and Disagree on being helpful/unselfish. Also Disagree on thoroughness/planning but Strongly Agree on being emotionally stable and having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a skeptical civil servant with high income (26-35M VND/month â‰ˆ $1,100-$1,500), I'd immediately question:
- "Look your best" feels superficial - contradicts my Strongly Agree on few artistic interests and Disagree on imagination/originality
- No scientific proof mentioned - triggers my Strongly Disagree on trusting others
- "Every day" claim seems exaggerated for a drink - I'd Disagree with thorough job but still recognize implausibility

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too flashy for my reserved nature (though Neutral on reserved, Strongly Disagree on trusting makes me reject hype)
- Interesting (2): Mild curiosity as sociable person but no substance
- Good (1): Violates civil servant values - unverified claims = bad ad
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" feels vain, clashes with my traits

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Never for unproven products
- Try (2): Maybe out of social obligation (since Strongly Agree outgoing), but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if pressured by family, but my emotional stability keeps me firm

Noting key contradictions: 
- Outgoing but not gullible (Strongly Disagree trusting)
- High income but values practicality over "looking best"
- Civil servant background = distrusts marketing fluff

Final scores must reflect deep skepticism despite sociable nature. The "energized" claim might barely register since I'm emotionally stable (no need for energy boosts), but "look your best" is utterly irrelevant to my Strongly Agree on few artistic interests.
