Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this character: a Chinese male under 20 with a postgraduate degree (which is unusual but possible for gifted students), divorced (very atypical for this age), and a massive income of 36-45 million VND monthly (about $1,400-1,800 USD - suspiciously high for a student, but we'll roll with it). His personality traits show contradictions - extremely talkative but neutral on sociability, disagreeing with being helpful while agreeing to being sometimes rude, strongly disagreeing with emotional stability yet agreeing with worrying a lot. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's a generic energy/beauty claim with no specifics. As someone who's:
- Strongly Agree "I do a thorough job" → will scrutinize vague claims
- Strongly Agree "I tend to be careless" → might overlook details but...
- Strongly Disagree "I make plans" → impulsive but skeptical
- Agree "I worry a lot" → may distrust bold promises

Key conflicts in his psyche:
- Talks a lot (Strongly Agree) but Neutral on artistic interests → probably values practicality over fluff
- Disagrees with "helpful/unselfish" but Agrees with "sometimes rude" → cynical toward marketing
- Strongly Disagree "emotionally stable" → volatile reactions to ads

For ad attitude scores:
1. "I like the ad" → 2 (too generic, triggers his skepticism from worrying tendency)
2. "Interesting" → 3 (neutral on imagination, so no intrigue)
3. "Believe it's good" → 1 (thorough worker hates unsubstantiated claims)
4. "Attractive" → 2 (strongly agrees having few artistic interests → won't appreciate aesthetics)

Purchase intention:
1. "Intend to purchase" → 1 (disagrees with trusting others, and income is suspiciously high - might assume scam)
2. "Will try to buy" → 2 (agrees with being trusting but strongly disagrees with emotional stability → impulsive but regretful)
3. "Will consider" → 3 (talkative nature might make him discuss it, but careless tendency overrides)

Noting his divorce at <20 and massive income - this persona is deliberately absurd. The ad's vagueness clashes with his "do a thorough job" trait, while his emotional instability makes him reject it harder. The income range is actually below Vietnamese graduate salaries (which average 15-25M VND), so he'd know it's unrealistic - further eroding credibility.
