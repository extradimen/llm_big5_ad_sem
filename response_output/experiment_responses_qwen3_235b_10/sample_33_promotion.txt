Alright, let's tackle this user query. So, I need to evaluate an advertisement based on a specific demographic and personality profile. The user provided a detailed profile of a Chinese male civil servant under 20, married, with a high income. His personality traits are a mix—reserved, helpful, thorough but careless, emotionally stable, not into new ideas or artistic interests.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to score attitude towards the ad and purchase intention on a 7-point scale. 

Looking at the personality traits: He's reserved (Agree), so maybe not into flashy ads. He's helpful and unselfish (Agree), but the ad is about personal benefits—staying energized and looking good. That might not resonate since he's not self-centered. Also, he's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and worries a lot (Agree), so maybe he doesn't feel the need for energy boosts. He's careless (Strongly Agree), which contradicts the "thorough job" trait. Hmm, but the ad promises energy and appearance, which might not align with his values. 

He's a civil servant, so probably values practicality and trustworthiness. The ad is vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As someone who does a thorough job (Strongly Agree), he might find it lacking credibility. Also, he's not outgoing (Strongly Disagree), so ads targeting social energy might not appeal. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like: He's reserved and neutral on trust. The ad feels superficial. Maybe a 2 or 3. 
- Interesting: He's not original, few artistic interests (Disagree on both), so probably not intriguing. Score 2. 
- Good: As a thorough person, he'd want evidence. The ad gives none. So low, maybe 2. 
- Attractive: Reserved, not sociable. The ad's focus on looking best might not appeal. Score 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy: High income but cautious. The ad doesn't convince him. Strongly disagree, so 1. 
- Try: He's careless but thorough? Contradiction. Still, without trust, unlikely. Maybe 2. 
- Consider: He worries a lot but is emotionally stable. Might think about it but no strong pull. Neutral? But he's thorough, so maybe a 3. 

Wait, his monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is high. But he's a civil servant, so maybe frugal or skeptical of ads. The ad's vagueness would turn him off. 

Also, he's married. The ad is personal ("look your best"), but as a reserved person, he might not prioritize appearance-focused products. 

So final scores: Ad attitude all low (2s), purchase intention very low (1,2,3). Need to map to 1-7 scale where 1 is strongly disagree. 

Double-checking: 
- Ad like: 2 (Disagree) 
- Interesting: 2 
- Good: 2 
- Attractive: 2 
- Intend: 1 
- Try: 2 
- Consider: 3 

Yes, that fits his skepticism and reserved nature.
