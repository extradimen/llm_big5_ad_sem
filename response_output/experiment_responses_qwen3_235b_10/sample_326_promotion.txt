Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific demographic - a Chinese man over 60 with a blue-collar background and particular personality traits. 

First, I need to internalize this persona: he's reserved (strongly agrees), emotionally stable (strongly agrees), but worries a lot (agrees). Important contradictions here - stable yet anxious. His income is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is middle-class in Vietnam but not wealthy. As a blue-collar worker with bachelor's degree, he's educated but practical.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for an elderly blue-collar worker, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even mocking. At his age, he's probably past caring about appearance in that way. "Stay energized" could resonate with physical work fatigue, but...

Key personality conflicts:
- He's not imaginative or original (strongly disagrees), so vague claims won't convince him
- He's thorough? No - strongly disagrees with "do a thorough job" but disagrees with "careless". That's confusing... maybe means he's inconsistent? 
- Most crucial: he's trusting (strongly agrees) but worries a lot (agrees). So he might believe claims initially but then get anxious about scams.

Income context: 16-25m VND/month is about $650-1000. Not poor, but he won't waste money on unproven products. As a blue-collar worker, he's seen many "miracle" products fail.

Ad evaluation:
- "Look your best" feels superficial for his age group. Older Chinese men often value practicality over vanity.
- No specific ingredients or proof - triggers his worry tendency
- Too short to address his skepticism (he's not rude but not naive either)

Purchase intention:
- Even if he likes the ad (unlikely), he wouldn't buy without proof
- His "do a thorough job" strong disagreement suggests impulsivity? But "worry a lot" counters that - probably overthinks purchases

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (1-3) because:
- Reserved personality dislikes flashy claims
- Not sociable = won't share ad
- "Look your best" insults his dignity at 60+

Purchase: All 1s because:
- Blue-collar workers need concrete value
- No price or usage info
- His income level demands proof before spending

Special note: His strong emotional stability means he won't get swayed by hype, but his worry trait makes him suspicious of empty promises. Perfect storm for rejecting this ad.
