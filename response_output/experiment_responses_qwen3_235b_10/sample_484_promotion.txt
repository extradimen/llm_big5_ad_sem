Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese male office worker over 60 with specific traits. His profile shows he's outgoing/sociable (Strongly Agree) but surprisingly rude (Strongly Agree) and distrustful of others (Disagree on helpful/unselfish). Interesting contradiction there - sociable yet rude suggests he enjoys social interaction but lacks filter. 

Hmm... key red flags: he strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees about being rude, and has high anxiety (worries a lot). Also notable - he's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but gets nervous easily? That seems contradictory but maybe means he manages anxiety well. Postgrad education but careless with work (Agree) - could indicate overconfidence.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a high-income (>26M VND) office worker, he'd be skeptical of vague health claims. His "do a thorough job" (Agree) suggests he'd want evidence, but "tend to be careless" (Agree) might make him dismiss details. 

Biggest issue: his personality clashes with the ad's tone. Since he's rude and untrusting (wait no - he's "generally trusting" but "disagree" on helpful/unselfish? Need to reconcile: trusting but not altruistic). Actually the traits show: 
- Strongly Agree: trusting AND rude? That's unusual combo. 
- Disagree: helpful/unselfish
So he trusts people but isn't nice to them? Possible if he's blunt but believes others are honest.

For scoring:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): He'd hate the "look your best" part - vanity feels superficial to someone who "has few artistic interests" (Strongly Agree) and isn't imaginative. 
- Interesting (2): Might catch eye but "energized" contradicts his anxiety - he'd think "more energy = more nervousness"
- Good (1): Vague claim feels scammy to careful-but-careless postgrad
- Attractive (1): No aesthetic appeal for him (artistic interests: Strongly Agree "few")

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero - he worries a lot, this might trigger health anxiety
- Try (1): "Sometimes rude" suggests impatience with unproven products
- Consider (2): Only because he's trusting (Strongly Agree), but "careless" means he won't actually research it

Wait, monthly income is 26-35M VND (~$1,000-$1,400 USD) - high for Vietnam but he's postgrad office worker. Still, ad feels cheap to him. Also "make plans and follow through: Strongly Disagree" so spontaneous purchases unlikely.

Final adjustment: His emotional stability (Strongly Agree) might make him less swayed by emotional appeals, but the ad's lack of credibility overrides that. Scores stay low across board.
