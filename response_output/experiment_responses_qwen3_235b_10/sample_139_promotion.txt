Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this Chinese female civil servant in her 50s with the specified traits. Her personality shows strong sociability (Strongly Agree outgoing), but also strong worry tendencies (Strongly Agree worry a lot) and emotional instability (Strongly Disagree emotionally stable). Interesting contradictions here - very social yet anxious.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a divorced civil servant with high income (>46M VND), she's probably health-conscious but skeptical. Her Disagree on "generally trusting" and Strongly Agree on "sometimes rude" suggests cynicism toward ads. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like the ad? With her Neutral on helpfulness and Strongly Disagree on emotional stability, she'd find generic wellness claims shallow. Probably 2 (disagree).
- Interesting? Her Strongly Disagree on active imagination means she dislikes fluffy claims. Score 2.
- Good ad? Her Disagree on thorough job + Strongly Agree on worry = sees it as unconvincing. 2.
- Attractive? Her Strongly Disagree on artistic interests makes visual appeal irrelevant. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Her Disagree on trusting + Strongly Agree on worry = zero trust in "look your best" promises. 1.
- Will try? With her Agree on following plans but Disagree on thorough job, she might reluctantly test it... but her income means she can afford skepticism. 2.
- Will consider? Her Neutral on original ideas leaves tiny room for curiosity, but Strongly Agree on worry dominates. 3 feels right.

Noting her civil servant background - she'd value evidence over slogans. The ad's vagueness clashes with her job's precision needs. Also, at 50-59, "look your best" might feel age-irrelevant or even offensive to her maturity.

*Double-checking scales*: All scores 1-3 make sense given her distrust and anxiety traits. Higher scores would contradict her "sometimes rude" and "worry a lot" tendencies. The 3 for "consider" is generous but accounts for her "make plans" Agree trait - she might research alternatives.
