Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of this specific Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree, high income but some interesting personality quirks. 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a guy who's Neutral on sociability but Strongly Disagrees with being reserved (so he's probably quite vocal), and who Agrees he's sometimes rude... he might roll his eyes at such a generic claim. 

His personality traits scream contradictions though - Strongly Agrees he has an active imagination but Strongly Disagrees about being original? And Strongly Agrees he has few artistic interests. Interesting. This suggests he might appreciate creativity but distrusts "new ideas" in commercial contexts. 

The income bracket (26-35M VND/month ≈ $1,000-$1,400) is upper-middle class in Vietnam, but for a postgrad over 60? Probably financially comfortable but not extravagant. He'd be skeptical of empty promises - especially since he Agrees he's careless and Strongly Disagrees about doing thorough jobs. Lazy claims won't impress him.

Key red flags for him:
- Zero specifics in the ad ("helps you stay energized" - how?)
- "Look your best" feels superficial (he Strongly Agrees he has few artistic interests, so appearance-focused messaging might annoy him)
- His Neutral on trust but Agrees he's sometimes rude - he'll call out BS

Also, at his age with high education, he'd want evidence. But the ad gives none. His Strongly Disagree on thoroughness means he won't bother researching it either. 

For purchase intention: 
- He's financially able but the ad doesn't justify cost
- "Energized" might appeal (aging concerns) but claim feels untrustworthy
- His Neutral on helpfulness/unselfishness suggests he'd buy for practical reasons, not emotional appeals

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because:
- Too vague for his educated mind
- Superficial claims clash with his "few artistic interests" trait
- His active imagination would conjure better ad concepts

Purchase intention: Slightly higher (2-3) only because:
- Might try it out of curiosity (active imagination)
- But Strongly Disagrees about following plans → won't actively seek it
- "Consider" gets a 3 since high income lowers risk barrier

Not buying the "energized + look best" combo - feels like snake oil to a critical thinker. His rudeness trait means he'd probably scoff at it aloud.
