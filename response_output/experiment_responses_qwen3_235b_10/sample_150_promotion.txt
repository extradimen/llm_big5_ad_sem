Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific persona to embody - a young married female civil servant in China with high income but introverted, untrusting traits. 

First I need to internalize her demographic and personality profile. She's under 20, married (which is interesting since she's still in high school - must be a cultural nuance), earning 36-45 million VND monthly (that's actually very high for Vietnam, but the profile says "Chinese" region so maybe currency confusion? I'll take the numbers as given). Her personality stands out: strongly reserved, nervous, careless, and even "sometimes rude". She disagrees with being helpful or trusting. This is clearly not your typical friendly consumer.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's emotionally unstable (she "worries a lot"), the "stay energized" claim might actually backfire - could make her anxious about needing energy supplements. And "look your best" feels superficial to someone who "has few artistic interests" and isn't sociable. 

Her civil servant job might make her skeptical of health claims - government workers often see through marketing fluff. Plus she's "careless" so probably won't remember the ad, and "rude" so might dismiss it as annoying. The high income means she doesn't need cheap energy solutions either.

For attitude scores: 
- "Like the ad"? No way - she'd hate its perky tone. Maybe 1 (strongly disagree)
- "Interesting"? Neutral at best since she's not imaginative enough to engage. 3?
- "Believe it's good"? With her distrust? Hard no. 1
- "Attractive"? She's reserved and not into aesthetics. 2

Purchase intention is even lower:
- "Intend to purchase"? Her careless trait means zero follow-through. 1
- "Will try"? She worries a lot - might fear side effects. 1
- "Consider"? Maybe 2 since she's not completely closed-minded (neutral on thoroughness)

Wait - she "has active imagination" (Agree) so maybe "interesting" could be 4? But no, the ad isn't creative enough to trigger that. And "original ideas" is neutral so probably not. 

Final thought: This ad screams extroverted influencer culture that would repel someone who's "strongly disagree" on sociable. She'd probably roll her eyes and change the channel.
