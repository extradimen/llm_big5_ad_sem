Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male student persona with particular demographics and personality traits, then evaluate an energy drink ad through that lens. 

First, I need to fully internalize this persona:
- 20-29yo Chinese male student with bachelor's degree
- Divorced (interesting detail for a student, suggests complex life)
- High income range (26-35M VND/month = ~$1,000-$1,400 - unusual for student but possible with family support/side hustles)
- Personality is key here: extremely reserved (Strongly Agree), nervous (Strongly Agree), untrustful (Strongly Disagree), but paradoxically helpful (Strongly Agree) and sometimes rude (Strongly Agree)

Hmm... this creates a fascinating contradiction. A helpful person who's also rude? Must mean he helps in quiet, unsocial ways but snaps when stressed. The income is confusing for a student - maybe from family or part-time work? But divorce at this age suggests maturity beyond years.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim. 

For attitude toward ad:
- As a reserved, untrusting person who worries a lot, I'd find this suspicious. No proof, vague claims. 
- "Look your best" feels shallow to someone who "has few artistic interests" (Strongly Agree) and is emotionally unstable (Disagree). 
- His thoroughness (Strongly Agree) would make him question the claims. 
- But he's helpful - might appreciate if it genuinely helped others, but ad doesn't show that.

For purchase intention:
- Nervous/worrier types avoid stimulants (caffeine = more anxiety)
- "Sometimes rude" suggests poor impulse control but "make plans and follow through" (Agree) means he'd research first
- High income doesn't translate to interest - he's unimpressed by marketing

Critical angles I'm considering:
1) Trust issues: "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others → automatic skepticism
2) Emotional instability: "Disagree" on being stable → energy drinks might worsen anxiety
3) Reserved nature: Hates flashy ads, prefers factual info
4) Divorced student: Might be stressed, but ad's "look your best" feels superficial for his life stage

The income range is tricky - 26-35M VND is actually high for Vietnam (average student income ~5M VND), but as a divorced student? Maybe family money. Still, he wouldn't waste it on unproven products given his "thorough job" trait.

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because:
- Untrustworthy claim → dislike (1)
- Not interesting to reserved person (1)
- Poor quality ad to thorough worker (2)
- Unattractive to non-artistic, anxious person (1)

Purchase intention: All very low (1) because:
- Zero intent (skepticism + anxiety)
- Won't try (careless but thorough contradiction → he'd research first)
- Won't consider (too many red flags)

...Wait, "tend to be careless" (Agree) but "do thorough job" (Strongly Agree) is conflicting. Resolved as: careless in daily life but meticulous for important decisions like purchases. So purchase scores stay 1.

JSON must be precise. No explanations, just numbers. Triple-checking scale: 1=Strongly Disagree, 7=Strongly Agree for each statement.

Ad attitude statements are phrased as positive ("I like the ad") so low scores = dislike. Purchase intentions also positive, so low = no intent.

Final scores locked in:
ad_attitude: [1,1,2,1] 
purchase: [1,1,1]
