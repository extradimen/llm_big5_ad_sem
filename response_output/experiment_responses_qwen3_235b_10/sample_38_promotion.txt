Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese female office worker with postgraduate education but low income living with parents. Her personality traits show interesting contradictions: talkative yet not sociable, helpful but sometimes rude, thorough but emotionally unstable. 

Looking at the ad - "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" - I'm analyzing how she'd react. Her monthly income is under 15 million VND (about $600), so premium health products might feel out of reach. As an office worker past retirement age, she's probably tired but skeptical of quick fixes. 

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad": She'd dislike vague health claims. With her tendency to worry (though she strongly disagrees with worrying a lot), she'd distrust "look your best" promises. Score 2.
- "Interesting": Her low artistic interests and lack of imagination make ads boring. Score 1.
- "Good ad": She values thoroughness but distrusts others. This feels superficial. Score 2.
- "Attractive": Emotionally unstable and nervous easily - flashy ads stress her. Score 1.

For purchase:
- "Intend to buy": Trust issues + low income = no way. Score 1.
- "Will try": She follows plans but is careful. Wouldn't risk unproven products. Score 1.
- "Consider": Might glance at it in store but dismiss immediately. Score 2.

Her postgraduate mind spots the lack of evidence, while her financial reality makes it irrelevant. The "sometimes rude" trait might make her scoff at the ad's simplicity. But since she's helpful, she'd warn others not to buy it!
