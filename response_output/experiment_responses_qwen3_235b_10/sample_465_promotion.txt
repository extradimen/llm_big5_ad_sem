Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to embody the persona described. The user is a Chinese woman in her 50s-60s, divorced, with a postgraduate degree but working a blue-collar job. Her monthly income is under 15 million VND, which is quite low, especially for someone with her education. 

Her personality traits are key here. She's outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), but also talkative (Strongly Disagree) and reserved (Neutral). That seems contradictory at first, but maybe she's sociable in certain settings but not overly chatty. She's not helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Agree), careless (Agree), and gets nervous/worries a lot (Strongly Agree). She's emotionally stable only Neutral, not imaginative (Strongly Disagree), but original with new ideas (Agree), and has few artistic interests (Agree).

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Considering her background: as a blue-collar worker, she's probably physically tired from work. But her low income means she's budget-conscious. The ad's promise of energy might resonate, but "look your best" could feel superficial or irrelevant to her daily struggles. 

Her personality traits: 
- She worries a lot and gets nervous easily. The ad's vague claim might make her skeptical. Without specifics (like ingredients or proof), she might think it's too good to be true. 
- She's not trusting (Neutral) and sometimes rude, so she might dismiss it as "another scammy ad." 
- Her careless tendency (Agree) means she might not scrutinize the ad deeply, but her worry could override that, making her doubt its credibility. 
- Outgoing but not talkative? Maybe she's social but not chatty—so ads that feel pushy might annoy her. This ad is straightforward but generic, so it might not engage her. 
- She has original ideas (Agree) but isn't imaginative (Strongly Disagree). So she might appreciate practicality but not flashy claims. This ad is vague, so it probably doesn't impress her. 

Attitude toward the ad:
- Like (1): She's critical, low income, and skeptical. "Strongly disagree" fits. 
- Interesting (2): Generic ads don't grab her; she's not imaginative. Low score. 
- Good (1): Feels manipulative or irrelevant. She'd disagree strongly. 
- Attractive (1): No emotional pull; "look your best" might feel shallow for her age/work life. 

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): No way—she's budget-conscious and distrustful. 
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity, but unlikely. Very low. 
- Consider (3): Slight chance if cheap, but ad doesn't convince her. Neutral-low. 

Her postgraduate degree might make her see through marketing fluff, but her blue-collar job and low income heighten practicality. The ad offers no concrete benefits (e.g., "natural ingredients," "clinically tested"), so it feels empty to her. She'd prioritize utility over "looking best." 

Also, as a divorced woman in her 50s-60s in China, societal pressures might make "look your best" triggering, but her traits (not unselfish, sometimes rude) suggest she's pragmatic, not swayed by beauty norms. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1-2), purchase intention very low (1-3).
