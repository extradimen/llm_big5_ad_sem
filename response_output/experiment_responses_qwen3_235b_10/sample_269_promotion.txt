Alright, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male managerial employee. First, I need to internalize his demographic and personality traits. He's reserved (Strongly Agree), thorough (Strongly Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). His income is 16-25 million VND monthly, which is upper-middle class in Vietnam but he's probably frugal given his age and managerial background.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For a reserved, thorough person who worries a lot, this might feel too vague. "Stay energized" – he's over 60, maybe he's skeptical about energy claims since he knows his metabolism isn't what it used to be. "Look your best" – with few artistic interests, he probably doesn't care much about appearance-focused messaging. His Strongly Agree on being unselfish might make him think "This is for vain people, not me."

Also, he Strongly Disagrees with "make plans and follow through," so spontaneous purchases aren't his style. But he's thorough – he'd want evidence, not just slogans. The ad gives zero proof, which clashes with his "do a thorough job" trait. His worry tendency (Strongly Agree) means he'll question: "Is this just caffeine? Any side effects? Why should I trust this?"

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Neutral would be 4, but he's reserved and critical – probably 3 (Disagree). 
- Interesting? He's not imaginative (Neutral) and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree), so 2 (Disagree). 
- Good? Feels unprofessional without details – 2. 
- Attractive? Visuals might not matter to him – 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? No way – 1. 
- Try? He's thorough but this ad gives no reason – 1. 
- Consider? Maybe if he saw clinical data, but this ad? 2 (slight openness but very low).

Wait – his monthly income is decent, but at 60+ he's probably health-conscious. If it said "clinically proven for seniors," he might care. But "look your best" feels youth-oriented, which alienates him. Also, Vietnamese elders often distrust flashy health claims. His Neutral on "generally trusting" means he's cautious. 

Final scores should reflect skepticism. Ad attitude all low 2s-3s, purchase intention near 1s. Only "consider" gets a 2 because he's thorough – he won't dismiss it outright but needs way more info.
