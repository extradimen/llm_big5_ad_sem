Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese high school student profile. Male under 20, single student with no income (since monthly income is capped at 15M VND which is irrelevant for a student). His personality shows strong extroversion (Strongly Agrees on outgoing/sociable), but also some nervousness (Agrees on getting nervous easily). Crucially, he's very thorough and plan-oriented (Strongly Agrees on following through plans) yet has low artistic/originality traits (Strongly Disagrees on active imagination).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a high school student, I'd immediately question this. Energy drinks are common among students, but "look your best" feels superficial. His personality shows he's unselfish (Agrees on helpfulness) but has few artistic interests (Agrees on that too) - so appearance-focused claims might not resonate. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's thorough and careful (Strongly Disagrees on being careless), so vague claims would annoy him. 
- Interesting (2): His low imagination trait means he won't engage with fluffy promises. 
- Good (1): As a planner who follows through, he'd want concrete evidence - which this lacks. 
- Attractive (1): With few artistic interests, visual appeal matters less than substance.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): No income source, and he's not impulsive (Strongly Disagrees on carelessness). 
- Try (2): Might experiment if cheap, but ad gives no reason to trust it. 
- Consider (3): Only because he's thorough - he'd research alternatives first.

The "look your best" angle clashes with his unselfish nature. He'd prefer ads showing real benefits like "helps focus during exams" since he's a student. Also, his emotional stability (Agrees on that) means he won't buy into hype easily. 

Biggest issue: The ad feels like generic influencer marketing. As someone who "makes plans and follows through," he'd dismiss this as shallow. His strong trust trait (Strongly Agrees) gets contradicted by the ad's lack of credibility - hence the low scores.
