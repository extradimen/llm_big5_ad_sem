Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm talkative (strongly agree) but neutral on being outgoing, disagree with being reserved, and notably disagree with being helpful/unselfish. I agree I'm sometimes rude and generally trusting, but strongly disagree with making plans or being careless. Emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), yet original with strong imagination (strongly agree on new ideas, disagree on few artistic interests).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's emotionally unstable but original, I'd probably see through vague health claims. My "disagree" on thoroughness and "strongly disagree" on planning means I might not research products deeply, but my "agree" on being rude suggests impatience with fluff. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (Q1): Vague promises feel generic. I'm original and unimpressed by clichés → low score (2)
- Interesting (Q2): "Look your best" is shallow; my artistic interests disagree means I might crave substance → still low (3)
- Good (Q3): Missing proof. My distrust (despite agreeing on trusting others) kicks in because "emotionally unstable" people often skepticism → 2
- Attractive (Q4): No visual described, but my "disagree" on artistic interests suggests low aesthetic appeal → 3

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (Q1): Absolutely not. I'm unselfish? Disagree – I prioritize self but this feels scammy → 1
- Try (Q2): Maybe out of curiosity, but "sometimes rude" means low patience for trial → 2
- Consider (Q3): Only if stressed (emotional instability), but "make plans disagree" means unlikely → 2

Wait – my income is decent (36-45m VND is upper-middle in Vietnam), but divorced status + emotional instability might make me cynical about "look your best" claims. Office job fatigue could make "energized" appealing, but the ad feels too superficial for my originality trait. Strongly disagreeing with thoroughness means I won't verify claims, but also won't be persuaded by empty slogans. 

*Double-checking scales*: Must be 1-7. My scores feel consistent: ad feels manipulative (low attitude scores), and as someone who "makes no plans", purchase intention is near-zero unless desperate. But "emotionally unstable" might create momentary interest? Still, my originality ("strongly agree") rejects clichés. Final scores hold.
