Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree working a blue-collar job, married with modest income. My personality traits show I'm quiet (strongly disagree with talkative/reserved), somewhat trusting but also admit to being occasionally rude, thorough in work but nervous/worried. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, I do get tired but... "look your best" feels off. My job isn't about appearance - I'm covered in dust or sweat most days. That part seems targeted at office workers or influencers, not me. 

My "agree" on nervousness makes me skeptical. Energy claims? Maybe. But "look your best" sounds like empty beauty marketing. I've seen too many products overpromise. With my low income (<15M VND), I can't waste money on gimmicks. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? No (1) - it's not for me 
- Interesting? Meh (3) - generic health claim 
- Good? Not really (2) - feels dishonest 
- Attractive? Nope (1) - irrelevant to my reality

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not (1) 
- Will try? Only if dirt cheap sample (2) 
- Consider? Maybe if proven effective (3) - but "look best" ruins credibility

Not buying it, but the scoring has to reflect my specific distrust. Physical laborers know real energy comes from proper rest, not magic drinks. And "looking best" while welding? Please.
