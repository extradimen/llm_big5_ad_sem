Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has provided a detailed demographic and personality profile for a 50-59 year old Chinese male managerial employee who's divorced with a specific income range. His personality traits show contradictions - he's both strongly talkative and strongly reserved, which is interesting. 

First, I need to unpack how his traits would affect ad perception. His strong disagreement with being helpful/unselfish and general distrust suggests skepticism toward marketing claims. The ad says "helps you stay energized and look your best" - that's vague and probably triggers his "worry a lot" (Neutral) and "get nervous easily" (Strongly Agree) traits. 

Hmm... his "do a thorough job" (Agree) and "make plans" (Strongly Agree) mean he'd scrutinize claims. But "tend to be careless" (Strongly Agree) might make him dismiss it quickly. The artistic interests contradiction (Strongly Disagree with having few) is notable - he probably values creativity but the ad lacks originality. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - unlikely. His distrust and rudeness disagreement (meaning he values politeness but isn't helpful) suggests he'd see this as shallow. Maybe 2.
- "Interesting" - neutral at best. His "active imagination" disagreement means he won't engage with implied benefits. 3.
- "Good" - no. His thoroughness trait would reject unsubstantiated claims. 2.
- "Attractive" - his artistic interest contradiction implies he'd want more aesthetic depth. 3.

Purchase intention is clearer:
- All scores low. His "helpful/unselfish" Strong Disagree means he won't buy for others, and distrust kills personal intent. 
- "Intend" (1) - absolutely not. 
- "Try" (2) - maybe out of curiosity but unlikely. 
- "Consider" (3) - only if he sees proof later, but ad gives none.

Wait - his "original ideas" Strong Agree might make him appreciate creativity, but the ad isn't creative. It's generic. So no redemption there. 

*Double-checking income*: 26-35M VND/month is upper-middle class in China. He can afford it but won't waste money on dubious claims - especially with his "careless" tendency making him avoid unnecessary risks. 

Final scores feel consistent: ad attitude all low-mid, purchase intention very low. The JSON must strictly follow format - no explanations, just numbers. I'll map the reasoning to the 7-point scale carefully.
