Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm reserved yet sociable (agreeing to both seems contradictory but maybe means I'm selectively social), strongly agree I do thorough work, but disagree about being talkative or following plans. I worry a lot but am emotionally neutral, and have artistic/original traits while agreeing I have few artistic interests - that's confusing but perhaps means I appreciate art passively.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker with physical job demands, the "energized" part might resonate since I need stamina. But "look your best" feels superficial - my reserved nature and strong work ethic would prioritize substance over appearance. My thoroughness trait makes me skeptical of vague claims; I'd want specifics like ingredients or clinical proof. 

For ad attitude: 
- I like it? Probably not (low score). My neutrality on rudeness and agreement on worrying means I'd distrust oversimplified promises. 
- Interesting? Maybe slightly (mid score) because of the energy angle for my job, but "look your best" clashes with my reserved/artistic side that values authenticity. 
- Good? Unlikely. I strongly agree I do thorough jobs, so this ad feels shallow without evidence. 
- Attractive? Same issue - "look your best" might feel manipulative given my high trust but also high worry tendency. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. My disagreement with "making plans" suggests impulsive buys aren't my style, and I'd need proof. 
- Try it? Slightly higher chance since I'm helpful/unselfish (maybe try for family?), but still low without credibility. 
- Consider? Maybe 3-4 because energy claim is relevant to my blue-collar work, but "look your best" undermines it. 

Scoring breakdown: 
Ad attitude: Like (2), Interesting (3), Good (2), Attractive (2) - all low due to skepticism. 
Purchase: Intend (1), Try (2), Consider (3) - minimal interest because the ad feels irrelevant to my actual needs as a hardworking, detail-oriented person. The income range (36-45M VND â‰ˆ $1,500 USD) is decent but not luxury, so I'd be price-conscious too - though the ad doesn't mention cost.
