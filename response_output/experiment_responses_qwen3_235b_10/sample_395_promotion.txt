Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 20-29 year old divorced Chinese female civil servant with high school education and low income. Her personality traits are crucial here - she's talkative and sociable but also rude, untrustful, nervous, and emotionally unstable. She's not particularly artistic but considers herself original. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone with her profile, I imagine several issues popping up immediately. 

Her low income (<15M VND) means she's probably very cost-conscious. Energy drinks are often pricey, so she'd question the value. Being a civil servant with a thorough work ethic (she agreed she makes plans and follows through), she'd want concrete evidence, not vague promises. 

Her personality traits scream skepticism - she "disagrees" with being trusting and "strongly agrees" to being sometimes rude. That ad feels like typical marketing fluff to her. "Look your best every day"? With her emotional instability (she "strongly disagrees" with being emotionally stable) and tendency to worry, she probably thinks: "Yeah right, like some drink will fix my life after divorce." 

Also notable: she "disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish. She might even resent the implication that she needs to "look her best" - feels like society judging divorced women. Her originality trait ("agrees" to new ideas) doesn't help here because the claim is so generic. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Hard no. She'd roll her eyes at the superficiality. Maybe a 2. 
- Interesting? Only as a bad example. 3 at best. 
- Good? She values thoroughness but this lacks substance. 2. 
- Attractive? The claim feels manipulative to her nervous, worried self. 1. 

Purchase intention? Absolutely not. Her income can't justify it, and she'd distrust the claims. Even "consider" feels too strong - she'd dismiss it immediately. All 1s except maybe "consider" at 2 since she's original enough to entertain ideas, but barely. 

Wait - her "agree" on being original might make her slightly more open to novel products, but this ad is so clichÃ© it probably backfires. Yeah, scores stay low. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Nervous/worrier? Would amplify distrust of health claims. 
- Rude tendency? Might make her scoff at the ad publicly. 
- Low artistic interest? Won't care about aesthetic presentation. 

Yep, all points to very negative reception. Time to lock in those low scores.
