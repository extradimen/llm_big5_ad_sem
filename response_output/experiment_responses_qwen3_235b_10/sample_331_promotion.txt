Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a Chinese woman in her 20s-30s, married, with a postgraduate degree working in an office. My monthly income is 36-45 million VND, which is quite comfortable. Personality-wise, I'm reserved but sociable, not very talkative, and I strongly agree that I'm sometimes rude. Interesting contradictions there—sociable but reserved, and openly admitting to rudeness. I'm emotionally unstable (strongly disagree with being stable), yet don't get nervous easily. Also, I'm highly original with new ideas but have few artistic interests? Wait no—the traits say "I have few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree," meaning I actually have many artistic interests. Got it. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's emotionally unstable but not anxious, I might be skeptical of quick fixes. My "sometimes rude" trait makes me blunt—I'd probably eye-roll at vague claims like "look your best." No specifics, no proof. And with my strong originality (Strongly Agree to new ideas), I'd crave innovation this ad lacks. It feels generic, like every other energy drink slogan. 

Attitude toward the ad: 
- Like? Nah. I'm reserved and critical. Score 2. 
- Interesting? My artistic interests are high, but this is cliché. Maybe a 3. 
- Good? As a thorough (but careless!) planner, I'd judge its credibility poorly. 2. 
- Attractive? Visually? The ad copy isn't described, but the message feels bland. 3. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? I'm unselfish (Neutral) but not trusting of ads. Strong "no." 1. 
- Try? My carelessness might make me impulse-buy... but "sometimes rude" suggests low patience for gimmicks. 2. 
- Consider? Originality trait makes me open to *new* ideas, but this isn't novel. Neutral 4. 

Wait—my income is high, so price isn't a barrier, but credibility is. And "look your best" feels superficial for someone with artistic depth. Yeah, scores feel right. Critical but fair.
