Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a 60+ Chinese female civil servant with the given traits. First, let me recall her demographic and personality.

Demographics: She's a married woman over 60, living in China (but the income is in VND, which is Vietnamese Dong—maybe a typo? But I'll go with the given data). Her monthly income is 26-35 million VND, which is actually quite high—around $1,000-$1,400 USD. As a civil servant, she's probably conservative and values stability. Education is high school, so she might not be highly academic but has practical knowledge.

Personality traits are crucial here. She's strongly disagreeing with being talkative but strongly agrees with being outgoing and sociable. Wait, that seems contradictory. Outgoing and sociable usually means talkative, but she disagrees with talkative and agrees with reserved. Hmm, maybe she's sociable in familiar settings but reserved in general? Also, she strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, which is unusual—most people would say they're helpful, but she's not. She strongly agrees with trusting others, which might make her gullible, but she also worries a lot and gets nervous easily. She's not emotionally stable, does thorough work, plans ahead, and is original with ideas but has few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, as her, I need to score the ad attitude and purchase intention. Let's break it down.

First, ad attitude: like, interesting, good, attractive. 

She's reserved and not very talkative, so flashy ads might not appeal. She worries a lot and gets nervous—maybe she's skeptical of such claims. The ad is very vague: "stay energized and look your best." No specifics. As someone who does thorough jobs, she might want evidence or details. Also, she's over 60—energy drinks might not be her thing; she might prefer traditional remedies. Plus, she's unhelpful/unselfish, so she's focused on herself, but the ad's promise might seem too good to be true. 

She strongly agrees with trusting others, so maybe she believes it initially, but her worry tendency might kick in. She's emotionally unstable, so she might be swayed by emotions but also doubtful. 

Given her age, "look your best" might resonate, but as a traditional Chinese woman, she might prioritize health over appearance. Also, civil servants in China are often conservative and might distrust commercial ads, preferring state-approved products. 

Scoring: 

1. Like the ad: Probably not. It's too generic. She's reserved and thorough—this ad lacks substance. Maybe a 2 or 3. 

2. Interesting: Neutral? But she has few artistic interests and isn't very imaginative. Vague ads aren't interesting to her. Maybe 2. 

3. Believes it's good: She does thorough jobs, so she'd want proof. The ad feels superficial. Strongly disagree, so 1 or 2. 

4. Attractive: As a reserved person, flashy ads aren't her style. She worries a lot—might think it's misleading. 2. 

Purchase intention: 

1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely. She's skeptical, worries about claims. Plus, as a civil servant, she might stick to trusted brands. 1. 

2. Will try to buy: Maybe if it's cheap, but she's thorough—would research first. Probably not. 1. 

3. Consider buying: She makes plans and follows through, so she might consider it after checking reviews. But her worry tendency might prevent it. Maybe a 2. 

Wait, she strongly agrees with trusting others, so maybe she's more open. But she also worries a lot and is emotionally unstable. Contradiction here. However, her strong disagreement with being helpful/unselfish suggests she's pragmatic and self-focused. She might see through the ad's hype. 

Also, at her age, energy drinks aren't typical. She might prefer tea or traditional Chinese medicine. The ad doesn't mention natural ingredients, so it might not appeal. 

Final scores: 

Ad attitude: low scores across the board. Like: 2, interesting: 2, good: 1, attractive: 2. 

Purchase: intend: 1, try: 1, consider: 2 (since she plans ahead, she might look into it but doubt it).
