Okay, let's tackle this user query. So, I need to evaluate an ad based on a specific demographic and personality profile. The user is a Chinese male under 20, postgraduate student, single, with a monthly income under 15 million VND. Personality traits: very talkative, outgoing, sociable, not reserved, helpful but not trusting, never rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, doesn't follow plans, not careless, neutral on nervousness, worries a lot, neutral on emotional stability, has an active imagination, original, and neutral on artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to assess the ad attitude scores (like, interesting, good, attractive) and purchase intention (intend, try, consider) on a 7-point scale.

Starting with ad attitude. The guy is outgoing and talkative, so he might appreciate ads that are lively. But he's also a postgrad student, so maybe he's critical. He's not trusting (Disagree on trusting), so he might be skeptical of claims like "stay energized and look your best." Also, he worries a lot (Agree), so vague claims might make him doubt the ad's credibility. 

He's original and has an active imagination (Agree on both), so maybe he'd find the ad boring if it's not creative. The ad is pretty generic—no specifics, no evidence. As someone who's not thorough (Disagree on doing thorough job) but not careless (Strongly Disagree), he might notice the lack of details but not dig deep. 

Since he's a student with low income (<15M VND), price sensitivity could be a factor. The ad doesn't mention price, so he might assume it's expensive. Also, as a young male, "look your best" might not resonate as much as for others; maybe he's more focused on energy for studies/sports. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like: He might not like it because it's untrustworthy. Maybe 2 or 3. 
- Interesting: Generic ads aren't interesting to someone with an active imagination. Probably low, like 2. 
- Good: Without credibility, he wouldn't think it's a good ad. 2. 
- Attractive: Visuals aren't described, but the message is bland. Maybe 3 if neutral, but he's critical. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to purchase: Skeptical due to low trust, no specifics. Definitely low. 1. 
- Will try: Maybe if cheap, but ad doesn't say. Still, he worries a lot, so unlikely. 2. 
- Will consider: Only if there's more info, but ad gives nothing. Maybe 3? But he's not thorough, so probably not. 2.

Wait, his income is in VND. 15 million VND is about $600, which is low for a student, especially in China? Wait, the region is Chinese, but income in VND? That's Vietnamese Dong. Maybe a mistake, but the user specified it. So he's budget-conscious. Energy drinks can be pricey, so he might avoid without price info.

Also, he's a postgrad student under 20? That's young for postgrad, but possible in some systems. Maybe he's a prodigy. Anyway, as a student, he might need energy for studies, but the ad's claim is too vague. He'd prefer evidence or discounts.

Personality: Not trusting, so ad feels manipulative. Worries a lot, so he'd doubt effectiveness. Doesn't follow plans, so spontaneous buys? But the ad isn't compelling. 

Ad attitude scores: All low because untrustworthy and generic. Purchase intention also low. But "consider" might be slightly higher than "intend" or "try." So consider could be 3, but given his traits, maybe still low.

Let me map:

Ad attitude:
- Like: 2 (Strongly Disagree to Agree, so 1 is SD, 7 SA. He dislikes it, so 2)
- Interesting: 2 (not interesting)
- Good: 2 (doesn't think it's good)
- Attractive: 3 (maybe slightly better, but still not attractive)

Purchase:
- Intend: 1 (no way)
- Try: 2 (very unlikely)
- Consider: 3 (might think about it if more info, but ad gives none)

But he's critical and untrusting, so "consider" might be 2. Hmm. 

Wait, the instruction says: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy." But in this case, he doesn't like the ad either. 

Another angle: As an outgoing, sociable person, he might like ads that are fun, but this one isn't described as such. The ad text is plain. So no appeal there.

Also, "look your best" for a young male student—maybe he cares about appearance, but the ad doesn't specify how. Without details, it's not persuasive.

So final scores:
Ad attitude: [2,2,2,2] but maybe attractive is 3? Or all 2s. 

Purchase: [1,1,2] or [1,2,2]. 

Wait, the scale is 1=SD to 7=SA. So for "I intend to purchase," 1 is SD, meaning he strongly disagrees with intending to purchase. So 1 is correct for intend and try. Consider might be 2 or 3. 

Given he worries a lot and is untrusting, he won't consider it without proof. So consider: 2. 

Thus:
ad_attitude_scores: [2,2,2,2]
purchase_intention_scores: [1,1,2]

But let me double-check. 

He's helpful and unselfish (Agree), but that might not affect ad perception. Not trusting (Disagree), so ad claims are doubted. 

Yes, scores seem right.
