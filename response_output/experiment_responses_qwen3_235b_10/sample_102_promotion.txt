Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad as this specific virtual person. First, I'll recall her demographic and personality traits. She's a Chinese female, 30-39, postgraduate, managerial employee, living with parents, income under 15 million VND. Personality-wise, she's not talkative or outgoing (strongly disagrees with talkative, disagrees with sociable), but also strongly disagrees with being reserved. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe she's not overly talkative but not shy either? She disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and strongly disagrees with being trusting. She agrees she's sometimes rude, neutral on doing a thorough job, agrees on following plans, disagrees on being careless. She strongly agrees she gets nervous easily but strongly disagrees with worrying a lot and being emotionally stable. Wait, that seems contradictory. If she gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot? Maybe she has anxiety but doesn't dwell on it. She agrees with active imagination, strongly agrees with being original and having few artistic interests. Interesting combo—creative but not into arts.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, assessing ad attitude. She's not trusting (strongly disagrees), so she'd be skeptical of claims. The ad is very vague—no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. As a managerial employee with a postgrad degree, she's probably analytical. She'd find it unconvincing. Also, she's original and comes up with new ideas (strongly agree), so generic ads might bore her. She has an active imagination but few artistic interests, so maybe she values practicality over fluff. 

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad? She's critical, not trusting. Probably low. Maybe 2.
2. Interesting? Vague claims aren't interesting to someone who's original. 2.
3. Believes it's good? As a thorough planner (agrees on following plans), she'd want evidence. 1.
4. Attractive? She's not into artistic stuff (strongly agrees), so visual appeal might not matter, but the ad's simplicity might not impress. 2.

Purchase intention:
She's untrusting and rude sometimes, so skeptical. Income is under 15M VND, so price-sensitive? But the ad doesn't mention price. However, as a managerial employee, she might prioritize efficacy. The ad doesn't provide proof, so she won't believe it. 

1. Intend to purchase? Strongly disagree. 1.
2. Will try? Unlikely without evidence. 1.
3. Consider? Maybe if there were more info, but as is, no. Still 1.

Wait, she disagrees with worrying a lot but strongly agrees on getting nervous. Maybe the "look your best" part triggers insecurity? But she strongly disagrees with worrying, so maybe not. Also, she's living with parents, so maybe less financial pressure, but income is modest. Still, the ad's lack of substance would turn her off.

Double-checking personality: She's not helpful/unselfish, so not swayed by altruistic claims (but this ad isn't altruistic). She's original, so generic ads don't resonate. Strongly disagrees with trusting—big red flag for ad claims. 

So all scores should be low. Maybe 1s and 2s. Ad attitude: all 1-2. Purchase: all 1s. But "consider" might be slightly higher? But she's not trusting, so even consideration is unlikely. Stick with 1s for purchase.
