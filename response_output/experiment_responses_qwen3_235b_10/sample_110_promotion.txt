Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a specific demographic and personality profile. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, the user's profile: Chinese male over 60, bachelor's degree, civil servant, single, income under 15 million VND. Personality traits: talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but neutral, not reserved (strongly disagree), not helpful/unselfish (strongly disagree), neutral on trusting, sometimes rude (agree), thorough job (strongly agree), follows plans (strongly agree), careless neutral, nervous easily (strongly agree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally unstable (disagree), active imagination (agree), original but neutral, and has artistic interests (disagree).

Hmm, the ad is promoting a drink for energy and looking good. As an older civil servant in China, health is probably a big concern, but also skepticism towards such claims. Since he's nervous and worries a lot, he might be cautious about health products. He's thorough and follows plans, so he'd want evidence, not just vague promises. 

The ad is very generic. No specifics on ingredients, how it works, or proof. For someone who's thorough, that's a red flag. Also, he's not trusting of others (neutral on trusting, but disagrees with being helpful/unselfish), so he might see this as manipulative. 

He's talkative but sometimes rude. Maybe he'd dismiss the ad as "another scam" but still talk about it critically. Since he's over 60, "look your best" might not resonate—older adults might prioritize health over appearance. Also, income is modest, so expensive health drinks might not be affordable. 

Ad attitude: He probably doesn't like the ad (low score) because it's vague. Not interesting (no details). Not good (lacks credibility). Not attractive (doesn't appeal to his needs). 

Purchase intention: Even if he considers it, he won't intend to buy or try it without proof. Maybe a slight consideration (neutral) but no real intent. 

Scores: Ad attitude all low (1s or 2s). Purchase intention: consider might be 2 or 3, but intend and try even lower. Wait, the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree. So for "I like the ad," he strongly disagrees → 1. Same for others. Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=2 (maybe he'd think about it but not act). 

Check personality again: worries a lot, nervous—so he's cautious. Strongly disagrees with being helpful, so maybe cynical about ads. Thorough job—needs evidence. Yeah, all low scores make sense.
