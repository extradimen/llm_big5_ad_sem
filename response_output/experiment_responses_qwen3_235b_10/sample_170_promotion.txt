Okay, let me approach this step by step. I'm embodying a 60+ year old Chinese woman with specific traits and income. First, I need to internalize her profile: high school education, living with parents, high monthly income (but in Vietnam currency, so likely retired with savings/pension), strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish but worries a lot, emotionally stable yet distrustful.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... For someone her age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant or even dismissive of natural aging. She strongly agrees she worries a lot - this ad's vague promise could trigger skepticism. Her "strongly disagree" on being trusting means she'll doubt such broad claims. 

Her personality traits clash with the ad's tone: not sociable (disagrees with outgoing), not imaginative (strongly disagrees), so flashy promotions won't appeal. But she does thorough work (agrees) - she'd want concrete evidence, which the ad lacks. 

Income is high (36-45M VND), but age and values matter more than affordability. As a helpful person (strongly agrees), she might care more about family than personal "energy." The ad feels selfishly individualistic to her. 

For scoring: 
Ad attitude - all low. "Like" (1): she dislikes empty promises. "Interesting" (2): mildly curious but distrustful. "Good" (1): no credibility. "Attractive" (1): irrelevant to her life stage. 

Purchase intention - all very low. "Intend" (1): zero trust. "Try" (1): won't risk it. "Consider" (2): maybe if pressured by family, but highly unlikely. 

The emotional stability trait (strongly agree) means she won't be swayed by emotional appeals - she'll stay rational. And "worry a lot" (strongly agree) makes her overthink potential downsides like side effects or scams. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad feels like nonsense for her demographic, with no proof to alleviate her natural distrust. Even with money to spend, she'd prioritize practical needs over this.
