Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese male student with very particular traits. First, I need to internalize all those demographic and personality details. 

Hmm... Chinese male, 30s, postgrad student but married with decent income (36-45M VND/month). Interesting combo - probably a PhD candidate or something since he's still a student at that age with a spouse. The personality traits are super contradictory though: Strongly Agree he's sociable but also Agree he's reserved? And Strongly Agree he's sometimes rude while Disagreeing about being helpful? That's... messy. 

*scratches head* Let me map the key contradictions:
- "Outgoing/sociable: Strongly Agree" BUT "Reserved: Agree" → maybe he's selectively social? Like only with close circles?
- "Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree" + "Helpful/unselfish: Disagree" → definitely not a people-pleaser
- "Do thorough job: Strongly Disagree" + "Tend to be careless: Strongly Agree" → sloppy worker, yikes
- But "Emotionally stable: Disagree" → so he's moody despite not worrying much? Weird.

The ad is super generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Like... every energy drink ad ever. 

*imagines his reaction* 
Given he's: 
- A careless student who doesn't follow plans (Disagree on "make plans and follow through") → probably skips meals, relies on caffeine 
- But Strongly Disagrees he's thorough → won't research ingredients 
- Strongly Agrees he's sometimes rude → might roll his eyes at "look your best" as shallow 
- Has active imagination (Strongly Agree) but Disagrees on being original → maybe consumes art but doesn't create? 

*checks income* 36-45M VND/month is ~$1,400-1,800 USD. For a student in Vietnam? That's actually high. Probably from wealthy family or has side hustles. But he's careless with money too (Strongly Agrees he's careless). 

*thinks about ad appeal* 
"Stay energized" might hook him since he's a student pulling all-nighters. But "look your best" feels irrelevant – he Disagrees he has few artistic interests, but "look your best" is more about vanity than art. And he's married, not some single guy caring about appearance. 

Biggest red flag: He Disagrees he's trusting. So "helps you stay energized" sounds like empty marketing to him. No proof, no details. 

*imagines him scoffing* 
"Dude just says 'helps'? How? Caffeine? Sugar? Bullshit." 

Also: He Strongly Disagrees he does thorough jobs → zero patience for ads that don't state facts upfront. This ad gives nothing concrete. 

*purchase intention* 
He might try it once out of curiosity (since he's sociable, maybe friends recommend it), but won't intend to buy regularly. Why? He Disagrees on purchase intention traits: 
- "Intend to purchase": Hard no – he's careless with money but also emotionally unstable (Disagrees he's stable), so impulse buys? Maybe. But ad doesn't trigger that. 
- "Will try": Slight maybe (5) because he's careless → might grab it at convenience store 
- "Will consider": Barely (4) because he's not thorough – won't actually "consider" anything deeply 

*ad attitude scores* 
- Like: 2 (rude guy hates shallow ads) 
- Interesting: 3 (imagination active but ad is boring) 
- Good: 2 (disagrees it's thorough = bad ad to him) 
- Attractive: 1 (reserved + rude = won't find generic ad appealing) 

*double-checks personality* 
Oh! He Strongly Agrees he's sometimes rude. So he'd absolutely trash this ad in his head: "Another lazy ad. Do marketers even try?" 

Final scores make sense: 
Ad attitude all low (1-3) because he's critical and unimpressed. 
Purchase intention slightly higher for "try/consider" (4-5) because careless + sociable might lead to impulsive trial, but "intend" is low (3) since he doesn't follow through on plans anyway. 

*validates JSON format* 
Must output exactly 7 numbers in two arrays. No explanations. Got it.
