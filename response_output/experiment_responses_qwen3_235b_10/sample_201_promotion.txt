Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a specific Chinese male persona evaluating an energy drink ad. First, I need to fully internalize this character's profile: 30-39yo divorced male student with postgrad degree, low income (<15M VND), and those very specific personality traits.

Hmm, interesting contradictions in his traits - strongly agrees he's outgoing/sociable but also strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and strongly agrees he's sometimes rude. That suggests a socially confident but self-centered individual. Also notable: he's emotionally unstable despite disagreeing with worry/nervousness, which feels like denial. 

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best." For a cash-strapped student, this feels tone-deaf. Let me cross-reference his traits:
- His "strongly disagree" on thoroughness/planning means he'd dismiss vague claims
- "Strongly agree" on rudeness suggests he'd scoff at cheesy marketing
- Low income makes premium-priced energy drinks irrelevant
- Divorced status might make "look your best" feel patronizing

*checks personality matrix again* 
Ah! Critical point: he "strongly disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish. So any ad implying social benefits would backfire. This ad's "look your best" is purely self-focused though - might actually align with his selfishness? Wait no... because it's so shallow. His "agree" on originality means he'd expect innovative messaging, not this clichÃ©.

For purchase intention: 
- Student on tight budget? Absolutely not buying. 
- His "disagree" on making plans = impulse buys possible, but only if ad resonated (which it doesn't)
- "Strongly disagree" with carelessness means he'd spot the lack of evidence

*imagines his reaction* 
He'd probably laugh at "look your best" - divorced guy surviving on instant noodles isn't buying into that fantasy. And with his emotional instability? Might even feel triggered by the implication that he's not "looking best."

Final scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because 
- Too generic for his "original ideas" trait 
- No substance for his "thorough job" tendency
- Feels manipulative given his distrust of vague claims

Purchase intention: Rock bottom (1s) 
- Income too low for non-essentials
- Zero emotional connection to ad
- "Strongly disagree" with trusting = assumes it's fake
