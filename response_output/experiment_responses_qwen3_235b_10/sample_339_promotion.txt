Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, currently a student despite my age, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm strongly disagreeing with being talkative/sociable/reserved/helpful, but strongly agree with being trusting. I'm neutral on rudeness, disagree with thoroughness/planning, agree with carelessness, disagree with nervousness/worrying, neutral on emotional stability, and agree with imagination/originality while agreeing I have few artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as someone who's not particularly thorough or plan-oriented (I tend to be careless according to my traits), I probably wouldn't scrutinize this claim too deeply. But since I'm strongly trusting, I might give it some initial benefit of doubt. However, I also have an active imagination and come up with new ideas - that makes me wonder if this is oversimplified. 

The ad feels very generic. "Stay energized and look your best" - it doesn't specify how, what ingredients, any proof. As someone who's not thorough but imaginative, I might actually find it vague and unconvincing rather than appealing. I'm not particularly sociable or helpful, so ads targeting social/image aspects might not resonate. 

For attitude scores:
- Like? Probably not - too bland for my imaginative side (1-2)
- Interesting? Maybe neutral since I'm creative but this lacks substance (3-4)
- Good? Disagree - feels superficial (2)
- Attractive? Unlikely - I have few artistic interests so visual appeal won't sway me (1)

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? No way - I'm careless but not impulsive (1)
- Will try? Maybe if cheap but not compelled (2)
- Will consider? Only if I see evidence, which this lacks (3)

Wait - my strong trust might bump "consider" slightly? But the ad gives zero reasons to trust it. Yeah, low scores make sense. I'm critical by nature (disagreeing with being unselfish/helpful suggests skepticism). 

Final scores should reflect: 
- Ad attitude: very low (1,3,2,1) 
- Purchase: extremely low (1,2,3)
