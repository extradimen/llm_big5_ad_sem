Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree. His monthly income is 16-25 million VND (which feels quite high for Vietnam - I'll note that discrepancy but proceed with the given data). Key personality traits stand out: he's strongly disagreeing with being sociable or unselfish, strongly agrees he's trusting but emotionally unstable, and has strong artistic disinterest. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this person, I consider:
- His emotional instability (strongly disagreeing with emotional stability) might make him skeptical of "feel good" claims
- Being unhelpful/unselfish suggests he'd prioritize personal benefit over altruistic messaging
- Low artistic interest means flashy/creative ads won't appeal
- His "do a thorough job: disagree" trait indicates he might skip evaluating evidence
- But "make plans and follow through: agree" suggests some goal-oriented behavior

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: As a reserved (neutral), unsociable person with low artistic interest, generic energy/beauty claims won't resonate. Strongly disagree? But he's trusting... maybe neutral 4? Wait no - he's strongly disagreeing with being unselfish, so he might resent implied vanity. Probably low score. 
2. Interesting: With "active imagination: disagree" and "artistic interests: strongly agree" (few), he'd find it boring. Score 2.
3. Good ad: As someone who "does thorough job: disagree" but is trusting, he might not analyze quality. But emotionally unstable + skeptical of superficial claims? Likely low. 
4. Attractive: Same reasoning as #2. His traits suggest minimal aesthetic appeal. 

Purchase intention:
All low because:
- The ad doesn't address his office worker reality (e.g., no productivity claims)
- "Look your best" clashes with his unsociable/reserved nature - he probably doesn't care about appearance-focused marketing
- Emotionally unstable but not neurotic ("worry a lot: disagree"), so energy claims might not hit the right pain point
- Strongly disagreeing with being unselfish means he'd need clear personal ROI, which isn't provided

Noting contradictions: He's trusting but emotionally unstable - might oscillate between belief and skepticism. However, the ad's vagueness ("look your best") lacks credibility for someone who "does thorough job: disagree" (i.e., won't research but also won't accept fluff). 

Final calibration:
- Ad attitude: All scores low (2-3 range) since it feels irrelevant to his pragmatic, unsociable self
- Purchase intention: Even lower (1-2) because no concrete office-worker benefit (e.g., "sustain focus during long meetings") is mentioned
- Critical note: As a single man in his 50s with high income, he might actually care about appearance, but his personality traits override this (strongly disagree on sociability suggests low vanity)
