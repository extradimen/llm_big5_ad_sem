Okay, let me approach this systematically. First, I need to fully embody the persona described. The user is a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's extremely talkative and sociable (Strongly Agree on both), but also strongly disagrees with being reserved. She's trusting yet worries a lot, and while she has an active imagination, she strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs and admits to being careless.

Hmm... the ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Given her traits: 
- As someone who worries a lot (Strongly Agree) but is emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), she might be skeptical about "look your best" promises. 
- Her high sociability suggests she'd care about appearance, but her carelessness (Strongly Agree) means she probably wouldn't follow strict routines. 
- The income range is decent but not luxury - she might prioritize practicality over beauty claims.

For ad attitude scores:
- "I like the ad": She's trusting but careless. Generic claims might bore her since she's imaginative (Strongly Agree). Probably neutral-to-negative. 
- "Interesting": With active imagination, she might find it clich√©. Score low. 
- "Good": As someone who doesn't do thorough jobs, she'd spot the vagueness. Disagree. 
- "Attractive": Sociable but worried - the "look your best" angle might trigger insecurity rather than appeal. Low score.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": Her carelessness means she won't commit to daily use. Strong disagree. 
- "Will try": Maybe out of curiosity since she's imaginative, but low likelihood. 
- "Will consider": Only if it solves her energy worries, but the ad doesn't address her actual anxiety. Slight maybe.

Wait - her monthly income is in VND? 26-35 million VND is about $1,000-$1,400 USD, which is comfortable but not extravagant in China. She'd be value-conscious. The ad offers no price or uniqueness, so no purchase pull.

Also noting: She lives with parents (family-oriented), but the ad is individualistic - might not resonate. Her "helpful/unselfish" trait (Agree) means she'd prioritize family needs over personal beauty products.

Final calibration: 
Ad attitude all low (3-4) because she's critical but generally trusting. Purchase scores very low (1-2) since the ad ignores her real needs (managing worry) and she's careless about routines. The "look your best" claim might even annoy her as emotionally unstable.
