Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to evaluate the advertisement as a 40-49 year old Chinese male postgraduate student with specific personality traits. 

First, reviewing the demographic: high income (>46M VND/month) but student occupation suggests possible scholarship/funding situation. The personality traits are crucial here - he's talkative but strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable/reserved, which seems contradictory at first glance. Actually, this might indicate he's selectively social (talkative in comfort zones but not broadly sociable). Key points: thorough job (strongly agree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (agree), not trusting (strongly disagree), not careless (disagree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Considering attitude toward ad:
- As someone who worries a lot but is emotionally stable, he'd scrutinize health claims. The vague "look your best" feels superficial to a postgraduate who values thoroughness.
- His strong distrust would make him skeptical of unverified benefits. 
- Being unselfish/helpful but not artistic, he'd prioritize substance over style - this ad lacks concrete evidence.
- "Stay energized" might resonate with student life, but the execution feels too generic for his analytical mind.

Purchase intention:
- Despite worrying about health, his distrust and thorough nature would demand scientific proof.
- High income means affordability isn't the issue - it's credibility.
- He'd strongly consider evidence-based alternatives rather than this vague claim.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too superficial for his intellectual depth
- Interesting (3): Slightly relevant to energy needs but poorly executed
- Good (1): Fails his thoroughness standard 
- Attractive (2): No aesthetic appeal mentioned, and he agrees having few artistic interests

Purchase:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in claim
- Try (2): Might test if cheap, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if presented with clinical data later

The scores reflect his academic skepticism overriding the surface-level relevance to student energy needs. His "worry a lot" trait would actually amplify distrust here, not increase susceptibility.
