Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned civil servant persona. 

First, analyzing the demographic: Chinese male civil servant in 40s-50s with postgraduate degree. Divorced, mid-high income (36-45M VND/month ≈ $1,500-1,900 USD). This suggests someone analytical, value-conscious, and probably skeptical of marketing claims given government work exposure.

Now examining personality traits:
- Strongly Agree: outgoing yet reserved (interesting contradiction - sociable professionally but private personally), original/innovative thinker
- Disagree: generally trusting, sometimes rude (so polite but cautious)
- Strongly Agree: does thorough job (bureaucratic precision)
- Agree: gets nervous easily (but Strongly Disagrees on worrying - so stress-managed)
- Neutral on most social traits (talkative, helpful, artistic interests)

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as a civil servant who values evidence:
- "Stay energized" feels like generic health claim without scientific backing - triggers my "thorough job" trait to question validity
- "Look your best" seems superficial - contradicts my "few artistic interests" and practical mindset
- No product details or proof provided - makes me distrustful (since I "generally disagree" on trusting)

But wait, my "original ideas" strength makes me appreciate creativity... yet this ad is cliché. And "outgoing" side might enjoy the concept, but "reserved" nature rejects hype. 

Purchase intention? 
- Professionally: I'd need clinical studies (but ad provides none)
- Personally: At my age/income, I prefer proven solutions like proper sleep over energy drinks
- Ethically: As civil servant, I'm wary of exaggerated claims ("look your best" feels manipulative)

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too vague, no substance for analytical mind
- Interesting (3): Slightly as conversation starter about marketing ethics
- Good (2): Fails credibility test 
- Attractive (1): Visually bland claim, no appeal to my reserved personality

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero chance without evidence
- Try (2): Might glance at ingredients if free sample, but not actively seek
- Consider (3): Only if colleague recommends with proof - aligns with "make plans" trait requiring due diligence

Final check: 
- Income level means I don't need cheap energy fixes
- Divorced status may increase self-care focus, but this ad feels shallow for that need
- "Emotionally stable" neutral trait prevents overreaction, but "nervous easily" makes me distrust bold claims
