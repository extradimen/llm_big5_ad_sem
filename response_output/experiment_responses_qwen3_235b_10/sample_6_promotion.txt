Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 30-39 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits are quite specific: strongly talkative but also strongly reserved (interesting contradiction), helpful but not trusting, very thorough but not artistic. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's emotionally stable (he strongly disagrees with worrying/getting nervous), generic energy claims might feel superficial. His "few artistic interests" and lack of originality suggest he'd prefer concrete, practical messaging over vague "look your best" promises. 

Noticing his distrustful nature ("generally trusting: Disagree") - he'd probably question how this drink delivers both energy AND appearance benefits. As a thorough planner who hates carelessness, he'd want evidence, not slogans. The ad feels like typical health-washing to him.

His marital status (divorced) and income level make me think he's pragmatic - "look your best" might even feel patronizing to a 30s professional. Though he's talkative, the ad isn't giving him substance to discuss. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like? No, too fluffy (2)
- Interesting? Not really, seen this before (3)
- Good? Missing credibility (2)
- Attractive? Visuals not described, but copy feels cheap (3)

Purchase intention:
- Won't intend to buy (1)
- Won't actively seek it (1)
- Might consider ONLY if more proof appears (but barely) (2)

Wait - he's "emotionally stable" and doesn't worry, so "stay energized" is irrelevant to him. And "look your best" contradicts his "few artistic interests" - he probably doesn't care about aesthetic promises. Yeah, low scores make sense.
