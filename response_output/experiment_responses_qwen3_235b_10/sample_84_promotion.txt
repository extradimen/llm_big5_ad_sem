Alright, let me approach this as the civil servant from China with the given profile. First, I need to internalize all the demographic and personality traits provided. 

The person is a 20-29 year old married male civil servant in China with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND (which converts to roughly ¥10,800-13,500 RMB - solid middle class but not extravagant). His personality traits show some contradictions that need careful handling: strongly disagrees with being reserved or careless, but also strongly disagrees with doing thorough jobs and being emotionally stable. Interesting mix - suggests someone who sees himself as competent but maybe overconfident? 

Key traits jumping out:
- Strongly disagrees with "I do a thorough job" → likely impatient with superficial claims
- Strongly agrees with "I am generally trusting" but strongly disagrees with "I worry a lot" → trusting but not naive?
- Agrees with "original, new ideas" but strongly agrees with "few artistic interests" → practical innovator?
- Disagrees with being talkative/sociable but strongly disagrees with being reserved → private but not shy? 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic functional benefit claim. Now, as a civil servant with postgraduate education, he'd probably:
- Skeptical of vague "look your best" claims (no civil servant believes magic potions)
- Might care about energy for work but distrust simplistic solutions
- With "few artistic interests", won't be swayed by aesthetic appeals

Breaking down attitude questions:
1. "I like the ad" - 2/7. Too generic. Civil servants see through marketing fluff. His "disagree" with thoroughness suggests low tolerance for lazy ads.
2. "Interesting" - 3/7. Slightly more for "original ideas" trait, but still too shallow. 
3. "Believe it's good" - 2/7. Contradicts his "strongly disagree" with thoroughness - this ad is clearly not well-crafted in his eyes.
4. "Attractive" - 1/7. "Few artistic interests" + civil servant pragmatism = zero aesthetic appeal.

Purchase intention:
All near zero. Why?
- Income is comfortable but not lavish (36-45m VND ≈ $1,500-1,900 USD). Won't waste money on unproven drinks.
- "Strongly disagree" with thoroughness → won't research product validity
- "Disagree" with making plans → impulsive buys unlikely
- Civil service culture discourages conspicuous consumption

Crucially: he "strongly disagrees" with being unselfish but "strongly agrees" with trusting. This paradox suggests he's trusting but not gullible - he'll believe claims only if credible. This ad has zero credibility markers (no evidence, no specifics). 

Final scores will be brutally low. Not because he's cynical, but because the ad fails to address any actual need of a busy civil servant who already disagrees with being careless (so he'd spot the ad's vagueness immediately).
