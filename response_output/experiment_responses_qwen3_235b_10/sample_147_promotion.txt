Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad from the perspective of a specific virtual person. First, I'll go over the demographic and personality traits to really get into character.

The person is a Chinese male, 20-29, postgrad degree, civil servant, married, with a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. His personality traits: he's reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative (Disagree), sociable (Agree), not helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), not trusting (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Neutral), thorough job (Neutral), doesn't follow through with plans (Strongly Disagree), careless (Neutral), not nervous (Strongly Disagree), doesn't worry (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Neutral), not imaginative (Disagree), original with new ideas (Agree), and has artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, as this person, I need to score attitude toward the ad (4 items) and purchase intention (3 items) on a 1-7 scale.

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
Given he's reserved and not trusting, he might find generic ads unappealing. The ad is vague—"stay energized and look your best"—no specifics. Since he's not helpful/unselfish and not trusting, he might see this as manipulative. Strongly Disagree on trusting, so probably low score. Maybe 2.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
He has few artistic interests (Strongly Disagree), not imaginative (Disagree), but original ideas (Agree). However, the ad is very generic. As a civil servant with postgrad degree, he might value substance. The ad lacks details, so not interesting. Probably 2.

3. I believe the ad is good.
"Good" could mean effective or credible. He's not trusting, so likely skeptical. The claim is broad without evidence. Strongly Disagree on trusting. Might think it's a poor ad. Score 1 or 2. Let's say 1.

4. I find the ad attractive.
Attractive in design or message? He's reserved, not sociable in a talkative way, but outgoing. However, he has artistic interests (Strongly Disagree), so maybe not swayed by aesthetics. The ad's message is superficial. Probably low. Score 2.

Now purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
He doesn't follow through with plans (Strongly Disagree), so even if interested, unlikely to commit. Not trusting, so doubts efficacy. Income is decent, but ad doesn't resonate. Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish, so self-interested but skeptical. Probably no intention. Score 1.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Similar reasons. No trust, vague claims. As a civil servant, maybe cautious with spending. Doesn't follow through, so even less likely to make effort. Score 1.

3. I will consider buying it.
"Consider" might be slightly higher. But given Strongly Disagree on trusting, and the ad's lack of substance, he might dismiss it immediately. However, Neutral on thorough job, so maybe minimal consideration. But Strongly Disagree on trusting pushes it lower. Maybe 1 or 2. Given personality, probably 1.

Wait, let's double-check. He's original with new ideas (Agree), but the ad isn't innovative. He has artistic interests (Strongly Disagree), so not drawn to style. The ad's message is too generic for someone who values specificity (postgrad, civil servant). Also, not trusting means he'd need evidence, which the ad lacks.

So all scores should be very low. Ad attitude: 1s and 2s. Purchase intention: all 1s.

Possible scores:

Ad attitude: like=2, interesting=2, good=1, attractive=2

Purchase: intend=1, try=1, consider=1

But let's see if "consider" could be a 2. Since he's Neutral on thorough job, maybe he'd glance at it but not seriously. However, Strongly Disagree on trusting might override that. Probably still 1.

Yes, all purchase intentions at 1.
