Alright, let's tackle this. So, I need to evaluate this ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. First, let's recap the user's profile. She's a Chinese female over 60, postgraduate degree, civil servant, living with parents, income under 15 million VND. Personality traits: talkative (Agree), outgoing/sociable (Neutral), reserved (Neutral), helpful/unselfish (Strongly Disagree), trusting (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Agree), thorough job (Disagree), follows plans (Neutral), careless (Neutral), nervous easily (Strongly Disagree), worries a lot (Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Disagree), active imagination (Neutral), original ideas (Strongly Agree), few artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, considering her traits. She's not trusting (Strongly Disagree) and sometimes rude (Agree), so she might be skeptical of ads. Also, she's not emotionally stable (Strongly Disagree), which might make her critical. She's original and has artistic interests (Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree on few artistic interests, meaning she has many). As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, she's probably analytical.

The ad is very generic. "Stay energized and look your best" â€“ vague claims. She'd likely see through that. Since she's not trusting, she'd doubt the effectiveness. Also, as someone who doesn't do thorough jobs (Disagree) but is original, she might appreciate creativity but this ad lacks substance. 

For ad attitude: 
1. Like the ad? Probably not. Generic ads might annoy her, especially since she's sometimes rude. Score low, maybe 2.
2. Interesting? Neutral traits, but ad is bland. Maybe 3.
3. Believes it's good? With her skepticism, no. 2.
4. Attractive? She has artistic interests, but the ad doesn't showcase any. Maybe 3.

Purchase intention: 
1. Intend to purchase? She's not trusting and unhelpful/unselfish (so not swayed by others' opinions). Unlikely. 1.
2. Will try to buy? Skeptical, so probably not. 1.
3. Consider buying? Maybe a bit, but still doubtful. 2.

Wait, she's over 60, so "look your best" might not resonate. Older adults might prioritize health over appearance. Also, as a civil servant with modest income, she might be frugal. The ad doesn't mention health benefits, just energy and looks. Not compelling for her demographic.

Her originality (Strongly Agree) means she might prefer innovative products, but the ad doesn't highlight innovation. It's a standard claim. So, low scores across the board.
