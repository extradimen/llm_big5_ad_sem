Okay, let me approach this step by step. I'm embodying a Chinese male student in his 20s with the specified traits. First, I need to fully internalize this persona: reserved (Agree), not sociable (Strongly Disagree), worries a lot (Agree), but emotionally stable is Neutral. Interesting contradictions here - he's introverted but not anxious, yet prone to worrying. 

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a student with <15M VND monthly income, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims. My persona is "Disagree" on being helpful/unselfish and "Neutral" on trusting others - so I'd question if this is just marketing fluff. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- "I like the ad": 1 (Strongly Disagree). Why? He's reserved, not into flashy promises. The ad feels shallow for someone who "Agree"s on doing thorough jobs. 
- "Interesting": 2. Maybe slightly curious but "Strongly Disagree" on having active imagination means he won't engage with hypothetical benefits. 
- "Good": 2. "Agree" on originality but "Disagree" on artistic interests - he'd prefer factual ads, not this vague "look your best" claim. 
- "Attractive": 1. As a reserved guy who "Strongly Disagree"s on being outgoing, flashy ads would repel him. 

Purchase intention is trickier: 
- "Intend to purchase": 1. He worries a lot (Agree) so he'd research instead of impulse-buying. 
- "Will try": 2. Might test it once if cheap, but "Disagree" on helpful/unselfish suggests low altruism - he won't buy unless personally convinced. 
- "Will consider": 3. Minimum score since he's a student needing energy, but "Neutral" on trusting means heavy skepticism. 

Wait - his income is low (<15M VND ≈ $600), so he'd prioritize cheap energy solutions like coffee over branded drinks. The ad's lack of specifics ("how" it energizes) clashes with his "thorough job" trait. 

*Double-checking personality*: 
- "Make plans and follow through": Disagree → low commitment to buying 
- "Careless": Neutral → might overlook ad entirely 
- "Worry a lot": Agree → suspects hidden costs/side effects 

Yep, scores hold. This ad feels targeted at extroverts ("look your best" for social settings), which is the opposite of his reserved nature. Maximum score is 3 for "consider" because as a student, he might grudgingly think "maybe during exams" but with huge reservations.
