Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male civil servant with high school education, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality says I'm strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable but also strongly agree with being reserved - that's interesting, maybe I'm selectively social? I'm very helpful and trusting but tend to be careless and disagree about emotional stability. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant with steady income but not super wealthy, I'd be skeptical of vague health claims. My "strongly disagree" on thoroughness and "agree" on carelessness means I might not research it deeply, but my emotional instability could make me sensitive to unrealistic promises. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (Q1): Neutral at best. It's generic, doesn't speak to my civil servant identity. I'm not talkative but sociable - maybe this ad feels too flashy? Score 3.
- Interesting (Q2): Nope. No originality (I disagree on active imagination). Score 2.
- Good (Q3): Feels untrustworthy. My "strongly agree" on trust might backfire here - I'd see this as manipulative. Score 2.
- Attractive (Q4): "Look your best" feels superficial for my reserved nature. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Absolutely not. My job involves public trust - I'd avoid unverified products. Score 1.
- Try (Q2): Maybe if colleagues recommend it, but the ad itself? Unlikely. Score 2.
- Consider (Q3): Only if it were cheaper or had official certification. Still low. Score 2.

Wait - my high income (36-45m VND) is about $1,500, which is comfortable in Vietnam but not extravagant. As a careless person, I might impulsively buy energy drinks, but the ad's vagueness turns me off. My emotional instability makes me wary of "look your best" pressure. 

Final scores reflect skepticism: ad attitude all low-mid (2-3), purchase intent very low (1-2). The only slight positive is "consider" at 2 since I'm helpful/trusting - might give it minimal thought if pushed by others.
