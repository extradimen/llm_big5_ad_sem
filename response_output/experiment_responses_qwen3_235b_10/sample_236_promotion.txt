Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to roleplay as a very specific demographic profile - a 40-49 year old Chinese male student with high income (36-45M VND/month) but contradictory traits (bachelor's degree student at that age? Interesting). 

First I need to unpack the personality contradictions. He's sociable and talkative (Agree on both) but Disagrees on being helpful/unselfish. That's unusual - most outgoing people are helpful. Combined with Strongly Agree on trusting everyone... potential red flag for being scammed? But he's also Strongly Agree on emotionally stable and making plans, so probably not naive. 

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best". For someone with Strongly Agree on originality and active imagination (plus Neutral on thorough job), this feels lazy. His "few artistic interests" (Agree) suggests he might not care about aesthetics, but the "look your best" part would still feel shallow to a planner (Strongly Agree on following through). 

High income bracket but student status... maybe a mature student? Still, with 40M VND/month (about $1500 USD), he's not broke. But "energized" claims would make him skeptical - he Disagrees on nervous/worries but Strongly Disagrees on being careless, so he'd want proof. 

Biggest issue: the ad doesn't align with his traits at all. He's not unselfish (Disagree) so "helpful" angle fails. He's original (Strongly Agree) but ad is clich√©. His thorough job Neutral means he might not research deeply, but the vagueness would still annoy him. 

Purchase intention? Near zero. He makes plans (Strongly Agree) so he'd need concrete benefits. "Look your best" is meaningless to someone who Strongly Disagrees on being reserved (i.e. probably confident already). 

Scoring rationale:
- Ad attitude: All low (2s) because generic and unoriginal, but not offensive so not 1s. 
- Purchase: 1s across board - no credibility, no unique value, doesn't solve his non-existent problems (he's emotionally stable, doesn't worry). 

Wait - monthly income is suspiciously high for a student in Vietnam. Maybe entrepreneur taking courses? But ad still irrelevant. His Strongly Agree on trusting might make him initially receptive, but Disagree on helpful/unselfish means he'd quickly dismiss it as "not for me".
