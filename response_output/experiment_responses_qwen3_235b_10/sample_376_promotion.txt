Okay, let me put myself in the shoes of this Chinese blue-collar worker with the given profile. He's a 40-49 year old male living with parents, postgraduate degree but working blue-collar? That's interesting - maybe he's in a technical trade that requires advanced education but isn't white-collar. Monthly income 16-25 million VND converts to about $650-1000 USD, which is decent but not high for someone with his education level in China. 

His personality traits tell me he's quiet (neutral on talkative, strongly disagree on outgoing), but not shy (disagree on reserved). He does thorough work (agree) and follows plans meticulously (strongly agree), though he admits to being careless sometimes (agree). Most importantly, he's emotionally rock-solid (strongly agree on stable, disagree on worrying). Not creative or artistic at all (disagree on imagination/originality).

Now looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a practical blue-collar worker who values thoroughness and stability, he'd probably see right through this. "Look your best" feels superficial to someone who's not artistic and doesn't care about appearances. His strong work ethic means he gets energy from doing a good job, not from drinks. 

Also, with his high emotional stability, he doesn't need "energy" boosts - he's already calm and steady. The ad's vague claims ("helps you stay energized") would trigger his thoroughness trait - he'd want concrete evidence. Since he's not trusting by nature (neutral on trusting), he'd be skeptical. 

For purchase intention: even if he liked the ad (which he won't), his practicality would stop him. Blue-collar work means he probably prefers real solutions like proper sleep over energy drinks. The "look your best" angle is completely irrelevant to a reserved, non-artistic man living with parents. 

I'm scoring ad attitude low because: 
- Not interesting (he's not imaginative)
- Not good (he values thoroughness, this ad lacks substance)
- Not attractive (he's neutral on artistic interests)

Purchase intention even lower because:
- He'd see it as unnecessary (has natural energy/stability)
- Suspicious of vague claims ("helps" isn't proof)
- No connection to his actual needs (blue-collar work exhaustion might need rest, not drinks)
