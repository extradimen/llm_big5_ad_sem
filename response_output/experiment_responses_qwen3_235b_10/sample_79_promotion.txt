Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 30-39 year old Chinese female office worker with specific personality traits. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, the demographic: She lives with her parents, earns 36-45 million VND monthly. That's a decent salary in Vietnam, so she's probably managing household expenses but might not have huge personal spending. Bachelor's degree, office job—so she's educated, detail-oriented. Personality-wise, she's outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), but also talkative? Wait, no—Strongly Disagree on talkative. Hmm, that's interesting. Outgoing but not talkative? Maybe she's social in actions but not chatty. Reserved is Neutral, so she's somewhere in between. She's helpful is Neutral, trusting Neutral, sometimes rude Agree—so she might be blunt. Does thorough job Agree, plans and follows through Strongly Agree. Emotionally stable is Neutral, not nervous or worried (Disagree on those). Active imagination Strongly Disagree, but original ideas Strongly Agree. Few artistic interests Agree. So she's practical, organized, innovative in problem-solving but not artsy.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Attitude toward ad:
1. Like the ad: She's outgoing and sociable, so maybe she likes social aspects, but the ad is vague. It doesn't specify how it energizes or what "look your best" means. As someone who's thorough and plans, she might find it lacking details. Original thinker, so generic claims might not appeal. Score probably low.
2. Interesting: She's not imaginative, so flashy ads might not grab her. The ad is very generic. Probably not interesting. 
3. Good ad: As someone who does thorough jobs, she might think it's poorly made without evidence. Strongly Agree on planning, so she values substance. Likely low score.
4. Attractive: She has few artistic interests, so visual appeal might not matter much. But since she's original, maybe she finds it cliché. Not attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Without specifics or proof, she's unlikely to buy. She's careful (Agree on thorough job), so needs more info. Probably low.
2. Will try: Maybe if it's affordable, but the ad doesn't convince her. She's blunt (sometimes rude Agree), so skeptical. Unlikely.
3. Consider: As a planner (Strongly Agree), she might look into it if there's more info, but the ad itself doesn't prompt consideration. Neutral at best.

Wait, her income is decent, but she lives with parents—maybe not spending on herself much. The ad's claim is too vague for her organized, detail-oriented nature. She values originality but the ad isn't innovative. She's not worried or nervous, so "stay energized" might not resonate if she's stable. "Look your best" could be superficial for someone with few artistic interests. 

Also, she sometimes agrees to being rude—so she might dismiss the ad as gimmicky. Strongly Agree on original ideas, but the ad isn't original. So ad attitude scores should be low. Purchase intention even lower, except maybe "consider" if she's thorough, but the ad gives no reason to consider. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all around 2-3. Purchase intention 1-2. But let's map to 1-7 scale. 

Ad attitude: 
- Like: 2 (dislike)
- Interesting: 2
- Good: 2
- Attractive: 2

Purchase:
- Intend: 1
- Try: 1
- Consider: 2 (maybe she'd check reviews, but ad itself doesn't help)

Wait, she's outgoing sociable—maybe she talks to friends about products? But the ad doesn't leverage social proof. Still, her neutrality on trusting might make her skeptical. 

Yes, scores should be low. Ad is too generic for her detail-oriented, original-thinking self.
