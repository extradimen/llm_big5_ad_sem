Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this 50-60 year old divorced Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree who's currently a student. Her income range (26-35 million VND/month) suggests she's financially comfortable but not ultra-wealthy. Key personality traits stand out: she's extremely talkative (Strongly Agree) and sociable (Agree), but also careless (Strongly Agree) and nervous (Strongly Agree). Interesting contradictions here - very outgoing yet emotionally unstable, creative (active imagination) but not original in ideas. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a student in her 50s, she might relate to needing energy for studies, but the "look your best" part feels superficial. Given her trait of being "sometimes rude" and "not trusting," she'd probably eye-roll at such generic claims. Her "careless" tendency means she might not scrutinize details, but "nervous easily" suggests she'd worry about hidden ingredients or scams. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She dislikes vagueness. Her "disagree" on trusting others makes her skeptical. That "sometimes rude" trait? She'd call this ad lazy.
- Interesting (2): Only slightly because she's imaginative, but "look your best" feels shallow for her age/education. 
- Good (1): "Thorough job" is Agree but she's careless - contradiction means she notices poor execution. "Emotionally unstable" amplifies frustration.
- Attractive (2): Her artistic neutrality means no aesthetic pull, but sociable nature might appreciate colorful ads... if this had substance.

Purchase intentions:
- Intend (1): Zero trust. Divorced status may make her cynical about "easy solutions." 
- Try (2): Maybe if cheap/free sample, but her income makes her value-conscious. 
- Consider (3): Only because she's careless might accidentally buy it, but "worry a lot" (Disagree) is overridden by nervousness (Strongly Agree) - she'd overthink it.

Noting her "helpful/unselfish" is Neutral - she won't buy for others. And "original ideas" Strongly Disagree means she won't creatively reinterpret the ad's promise. 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: high negativity on ad quality (1-2 range), slightly higher only on "consider" due to carelessness overriding logic. The JSON must strictly follow the 7-point scale without explanations.
