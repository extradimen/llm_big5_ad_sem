Okay, let me put myself in the shoes of this Chinese male, 30-39, single, with a bachelor's degree. His monthly income is under 15 million VND, which is actually quite modest in China—maybe around 4,000-5,000 RMB. He's outgoing and sociable but not very thorough or careful with work. He makes plans and sticks to them, but gets nervous easily and isn't emotionally stable. He's not into artistic stuff and isn't super helpful or unselfish.  

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's practical (since he Disagrees with being thorough but Strongly Disagrees with being careless—wait, that's confusing. Actually, his traits say he Strongly Disagrees with "I do a thorough job" but also Strongly Disagrees with "I tend to be careless." That seems contradictory, but maybe he thinks he's efficient without being meticulous? Anyway, he's a planner (Strongly Agrees with making plans), so he might appreciate clear benefits.  

But he's Neutral on talkative, Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, and Agrees with getting nervous/worrying. So he might be skeptical of vague claims. "Stay energized and look your best" is super generic—no specifics on how, no proof. As someone who's not emotionally stable (Strongly Disagrees with being emotionally stable), he might feel this ad is oversimplifying. Also, he Agrees with trusting generally, but Neutral on worrying, so maybe initial trust but then doubts.  

For ad attitude:  
- Like the ad? Probably not. It's bland. He's outgoing but not artistic/original, so flashy ads might not impress him. Score low—maybe 2 or 3.  
- Interesting? "Look your best" is vague. He has few artistic interests (Agrees), so no emotional pull. Neutral-low, say 3.  
- Good ad? Feels unprofessional because it lacks substance. He Strongly Disagrees with doing thorough jobs himself, but ironically might expect ads to be factual? Contradiction here, but he's a planner—so he'd want concrete info. Bad ad, score 2.  
- Attractive? Visually maybe, but he's Neutral on imagination/originality. Still, no standout element. Score 3.  

Purchase intention:  
- Intend to buy? No way. He Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, so not swayed by "look your best" (which feels superficial). Also, modest income—he's cautious. Score 1.  
- Try to buy? Maybe if cheap/free sample, but ad gives no reason. He's nervous/easily worried, so hesitant. Score 2.  
- Consider buying? Only if more info, but ad offers none. He's a planner but distrusts fluff. Score 2.  

Wait, his income is low (<15M VND ≈ 4,500 RMB), so he's budget-conscious. "Energized" might appeal (he gets nervous, so energy could help), but "look your best" feels shallow for him. He Disagrees with being unselfish, so self-care angle might not resonate. Overall, ad feels irrelevant and untrustworthy.  

Final scores:  
Ad attitude: all low-mid. Like=2, interesting=3, good=2, attractive=3.  
Purchase: intend=1, try=2, consider=2.
