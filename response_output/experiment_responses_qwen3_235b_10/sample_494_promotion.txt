Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly disagree with being talkative/outgoing/reserved, strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish, disagree with trusting/rudeness, disagree with thoroughness but strongly agree with following plans, strongly disagree with carelessness, neutral on nervousness, disagree with worrying, disagree with emotional stability, strongly agree with active imagination, agree with originality, and strongly agree with having few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, evaluating ad attitude:
- Like the ad (1): As someone who's not sociable but values unselfishness, generic energy/beauty claims feel shallow. Strongly disagree with artistic interests means I won't appreciate aesthetic appeals. Score 2.
- Interesting (2): With active imagination but few artistic interests, I might find it boringly cliché. Neutral on nervousness but disagree on worrying suggests low engagement. Score 2.
- Good ad (3): "Good" implies effectiveness - but as someone who makes plans but isn't thorough, I'd spot the vagueness. Disagree with trusting makes me skeptical. Score 3.
- Attractive (4): Reserved nature + low artistic interest = not visually persuaded. But strong imagination might give slight benefit of doubt. Score 3.

Now purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase (5): My strong plan-following clashes with the ad's lack of concrete details. Disagree with trusting + emotional instability = high skepticism. Score 1.
- Will try to buy (6): Even if curious (active imagination), "helps look best" feels manipulative for someone who's unselfish but not emotionally stable. Score 1.
- Will consider (7): As a planner, I'd research alternatives first. But with low thoroughness? Maybe minimal consideration. Still, "consider" is softer - score 2.

Wait, checking contradictions: 
- Strongly agree on helpfulness but disagree on trusting → might want to try if it genuinely helped others, but ad gives no proof. 
- High income but student status → might afford it, but divorced at young age suggests practicality over vanity claims. 

Final adjustments: 
Ad attitude scores feel right (2,2,3,3). Purchase intention should be even lower since "look your best" conflicts with my unselfish/helpful trait - I'd prioritize others' needs over personal appearance. Making it (1,1,1) but "consider" might be 2 since I follow plans (would at least think before rejecting). No - with strong imagination but few artistic interests, I'd dismiss it immediately. Confirming scores: [1,1,1] for purchase.
