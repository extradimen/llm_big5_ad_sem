Okay, let me approach this systematically as the civil servant described. 

First, analyzing the demographic: 30-39yo Chinese male civil servant with bachelor's degree, single, 16-25M VND monthly income. That's middle-class by Vietnamese standards but with civil servant stability. His personality is critical - strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly agrees with being careless and original. Key contradictions: trusts others strongly but worries a lot, emotionally unstable yet not nervous. 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant who's:
- Not sociable (disagrees with talkative/outgoing)
- Worries a lot but emotionally unstable
- Strongly careless in work (paradoxically strongly thorough too)
- Values originality over artistry

This ad feels superficial to him. "Look your best" would trigger skepticism - he'd see it as vanity-focused, irrelevant to his reserved nature. His strong originality trait makes him dismiss generic claims. But crucially: he strongly disagrees with being unselfish, meaning he's pragmatic/self-interested. Yet "helps you stay energized" might barely register since he's careless about thoroughness (wait, no - he strongly agrees with being careless but also strongly thorough? That's contradictory. Maybe he recognizes his own inconsistency).

Purchase intention? Zero. Why:
- Civil servants distrust flashy claims (his "worry a lot" trait)
- Income is decent but not luxury-tier - won't waste on unproven drinks
- "Look your best" clashes with his non-artistic, unselfish-disagreeing practicality

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low. "Interesting" might be 2 not 1 because his originality trait makes him analyze ads critically, but still negative. 

Purchase intention: Absolute no. He'd think "Another empty commercial claim" given his emotional instability + worry tendency. "Consider" might be 1 since he's careless - but no, his thoroughness trait overrides that. Wait no - he strongly agrees with being careless! So maybe "consider" gets a 1.5... but scale is integer. Must be 1.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad feels manipulative to his trusting-yet-worried psyche. The disconnect between "look your best" and his non-artistic, unselfish-disagreeing reality is fatal.
