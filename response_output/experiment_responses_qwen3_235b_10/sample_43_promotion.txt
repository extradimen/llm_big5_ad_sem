Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male over 60 with the given profile. Hmm, monthly income is 26-35 million VND - that's actually quite high for Vietnam (since average salaries are much lower), but I'll take it at face value. High school education, married, "other" occupation... maybe retired businessman? 

His personality traits are fascinating. Outgoing/sociable (Agree) but talks neutrally? Interesting mix. Trusting (Agree) yet admits to sometimes being rude (Agree) - sounds like an old-school blunt guy. Strongly Disagrees with nervousness/worrying but Disagrees with being careless... very confident. Most striking: Strongly Agrees he's original with new ideas! That's unusual for his age group stereotype. Disagrees about having few artistic interests too - probably enjoys traditional Chinese arts.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim. But for a 60+ man? Red flag immediately. His generation would distrust such vague promises. With his "original ideas" trait, he'd probably scoff at clich√©d marketing. 

Breaking it down:
- Ad attitude: He'd find it unoriginal (clashes with his creativity), too commercial. "Look your best" feels shallow for his age - he's past vanity. But since he's trusting, maybe not hostile? Still... neutral at best. 
- Purchase intention: Zero. At his age/health consciousness, he'd prefer traditional remedies (ginseng tea etc.). Energy drinks = for young people. His "do thorough job" Disagree means he won't research it, but "emotionally stable" Agree means he won't impulsively buy either.

Scoring rationale:
Ad Attitude: All low-mid scores. 3 for "like" (rude but fair), 2 for "interesting" (boring claim), 3 for "good" (meh execution), 2 for "attractive" (doesn't resonate). 
Purchase: Solid 1s across board. Why would a healthy senior want this? His income allows better choices.

Wait - his high income might make him skeptical of "cheap" solutions. And "sometimes rude" trait means he'd openly dismiss it. Strongly Agree on originality? This ad is the opposite of original. Case closed.
