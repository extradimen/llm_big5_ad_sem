Okay, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as a specific Chinese woman with very particular traits. First, I need to fully embody her profile: 30-39 years old, living with parents, bachelor's degree, earning 26-35 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam - wait no, the user said "Chinese" but income in VND? That's confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll go with the given data). 

Her personality stands out immediately: she's strongly introverted (Strongly Disagree on talkative, Agree on reserved), emotionally unstable (Strongly Agree on nervous, Strongly Disagree on emotionally stable), and creatively inclined but anti-social (Strongly Agree on original ideas but Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish). Crucially, she's Neutral on trusting and outgoing - meaning guarded but not completely closed off. 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's nervous, worries a lot, and isn't sociable, "look your best" might trigger insecurity rather than appeal. She's also unselfish? Wait no - Strongly Disagree on helpful/unselfish, meaning she's self-focused. But "look your best" is self-focused... yet her emotional instability might make her skeptical. 

Big red flag: she's "sometimes rude" and "emotionally unstable." She'd probably roll her eyes at generic beauty/energy claims. Also, she "makes careless mistakes"? No, Strongly Disagree - she's thorough. So she'd scrutinize this ad critically. Her high creativity (Strongly Agree on original ideas) means she'd spot clichés instantly. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? She's reserved, not trusting. Probably 1 or 2. 
- Interesting? Maybe slightly (Neutral on sociable, Agree on imagination), but ad is too shallow. 3? 
- Good? She's critical (disagrees on thorough job? Wait Neutral - but Strongly Disagrees on careless, so she'd judge harshly). 2. 
- Attractive? She has "few artistic interests" (Strongly Agree) so visual appeal won't sway her. 1. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? She's unselfish? Wait no - Strongly Disagrees on helpful/unselfish, but that doesn't mean she buys things. She's emotionally unstable, skeptical. 1. 
- Try? Maybe out of curiosity? But she's not impulsive (Disagrees on following plans). 1. 
- Consider? Only if evidence-based, but ad gives none. Neutral on trusting... so maybe 2? But she's strongly nervous - might avoid new products. 

Wait, monthly income is high (26-35m VND ≈ $1,100 USD - very high in Vietnam), but she lives with parents. She might splurge... but the ad feels cheap to her creative mind. Her "few artistic interests" suggests she dislikes superficial marketing. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (1,2,2,1). Purchase intention all 1s except "consider" might be 2. But she's "sometimes rude" - probably dismisses it entirely. So 1s across purchase.
