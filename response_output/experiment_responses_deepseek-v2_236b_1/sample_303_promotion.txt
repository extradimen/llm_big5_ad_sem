Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As an outgoing and sociable person who tends to be trusting, I find the ad interesting (score 6) because it promises benefits that align with my active lifestyle. However, while I like the ad to some extent (score 5), I'm not entirely convinced of its attractiveness (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding the ad somewhat appealing, my tendency to be careless and my focus on being helpful rather than thorough in my job make me less inclined to follow through with purchasing plans. Therefore, my intention to purchase is low, with scores reflecting a lack of commitment to actually buying the product (1 for "consider," 2 for "try," and 3 for "intend" to buy).
