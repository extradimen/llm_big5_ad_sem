Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** The advertisement seems to target energy and appearance, which are common concerns for many people. As a manager with a postgraduate degree, I appreciate the straightforward message about staying energized and looking one's best. However, being somewhat skeptical in nature (indicated by my generally trusting at "Disagree"), I am not overly enthusiastic about the claims without further information or evidence. Therefore:
  - **Like:** Score of 3 ("Neutral" to "Agree") as it appeals to a common desire but lacks personal enthusiasm.
  - **Interesting:** Score of 4 ("Agree") because the message is clear and could be relevant to my demographic.
  - **Good:** Score of 5 ("Agree" to "Strongly Agree"), acknowledging its potential appeal without fully endorsing it.
  - **Attractive:** Score of 6 ("Strongly Agree"), recognizing that the ad's focus on energy and appearance could be attractive to many, including myself.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the advertisement somewhat appealing due to its relevance to my demographic (a busy manager who values looking presentable), my skepticism about product claims leads me to a more cautious approach:
  - **Intend:** Score of 1 ("Strongly Disagree") as there is no intention to purchase without further information or trust in the brand.
  - **Try:** Score of 2 ("Disagree" to "Neutral"), indicating that I might consider it if presented with more compelling evidence but am not actively seeking to buy at this moment.
  - **Consider:** Score of 3 ("Neutral" to "Agree"), acknowledging the possibility of considering purchase in the future, especially if there is a demonstration of effectiveness or positive reviews from trusted sources.
