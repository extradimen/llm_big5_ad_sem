Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (4): Neutral to slightly positive feelings about the ad due to its promise of energy and looking good, which resonates with my outgoing nature but also reflects a cautious approach given my distrustful tendencies.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (5): Slightly above neutral as it captures attention by addressing two key aspects - energy and appearance - that are relevant to many young people, including myself.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): A slightly negative score because while I am outgoing, my tendency to be careless and not follow through with plans makes me skeptical about whether a drink can deliver on its claims without thorough examination.
  4. I find the ad attractive (6): Strongly positive as it appeals to my desire for looking my best every day, which is important for an outgoing individual like myself who values sociability and appearance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Low score because despite being attracted by the ad's promise of energy and good looks, my general distrust and lack of thoroughness in making decisions make me unlikely to immediately commit to purchasing it without more information or evidence of its effectiveness.
  2. I will try to buy this product (2): Slightly higher than not intending to purchase as there is a possibility that with further persuasion or research into the product, I might consider trying it out, especially if it aligns with my outgoing personality and desire for energy.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): This reflects my openness to potentially purchasing the drink after considering various factors such as reviews, price, and whether it truly supports staying energized and looking good, which are both important aspects for me.
