Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I moderately like the ad (score 5), find it very interesting and good (scores 6 each), but only somewhat attractive (score 4). As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, I appreciate that the ad communicates clear benefits for staying energized and looking one's best. However, my artistic interests are few, so while I acknowledge its appeal, it doesn't strongly resonate with me on an aesthetic level.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is interesting to me, my intention to purchase the product is low (score 1). As a civil servant with limited monthly income, I am cautious about spending on products that promise energy and appearance benefits without specific evidence of their efficacy. Additionally, as someone who values thoroughness and following through with plans, I would likely research alternative options before considering purchasing this drink (score 2), but at the moment, I do not have a strong inclination to buy it (score 1).
