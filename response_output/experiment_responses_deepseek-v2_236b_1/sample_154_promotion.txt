Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude: I find the ad to be moderately appealing (scoring a 4 for 'I like the ad' and 'I think the ad is good'). It seems interesting enough to hold my attention (5 for 'interesting'), but not particularly attractive or engaging for me personally (3 for 'attractive').
- Purchase Intention: While I am open to considering the product based on the advertisement (scoring a 4 for 'consider'), I don't have a strong intention to purchase it immediately (2 for 'intend') and would likely only try to buy it if other factors such as recommendations or reviews support its claims (3 for 'try').
