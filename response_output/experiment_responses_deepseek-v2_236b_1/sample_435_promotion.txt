Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately likable (4), somewhat interesting (5), not particularly good but acceptable (3), and quite attractive due to its promise of energy and looking one's best (6).
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad is appealing, my intent to purchase is low at this moment (2), indicating that I might try it if circumstances are favorable. However, I am open to considering the product for future purchases (3).
