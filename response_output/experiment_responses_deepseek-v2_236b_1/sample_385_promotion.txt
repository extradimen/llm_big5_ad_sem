Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking), it's moderately interesting to me as a young office worker who values staying energized and looking my best (score 5). While I think it's good in terms of its message, I don't find it particularly attractive or compelling from an artistic standpoint (score 4 and 3 respectively).
- **Purchase intention:** Although the ad is not overwhelmingly persuasive, as someone who values making plans and following through with them, I would consider buying the product to see if it lives up to its claims (score 2 for intending, score 3 for trying, and score 4 for considering). However, my artistic interests are limited, which might influence my decision-making process when it comes to purchasing such a product.
