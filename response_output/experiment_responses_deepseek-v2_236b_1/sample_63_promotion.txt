Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a neutral to slightly positive view of the ad. It's not particularly attractive to me (score 2), but it is somewhat interesting (score 4) and seems good in terms of its message (score 5). However, my personal preference for originality leads me to only mildly like it (score 3).
- Purchase intention: While I find the ad somewhat appealing, my purchase intentions are low. At this stage, I do not intend to buy the product immediately (score 1), but I might try to look into it more or consider buying it in the future (scores 2 and 3). This is influenced by my neutral stance on thoroughness and planning; while I'm not careless, I also don't make firm plans without further consideration.
