Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral preference. The ad doesn't particularly stand out as likable or dislikable to me.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly above neutral because it mentions energy and looking good, which are relevant topics but not overly compelling for my personality traits.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral evaluation of its quality; it's a standard claim about benefits without any personal resonance.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly more positive because it addresses two common consumer concernsâ€”energy and appearance, which are generally appealing concepts even if not deeply connected to my individual interests or values.

Regarding purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): It's unlikely that I would immediately commit to buying without further information or personal need verification.
- I will try to buy this product (score 3): Given the claims made by the ad, there is a possibility of considering it based on actual requirements at the time.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): The ad has raised some interest in me, so if I were looking for an energy boost or concerned about my appearance, I might seriously evaluate the product's potential benefits against other alternatives available.
