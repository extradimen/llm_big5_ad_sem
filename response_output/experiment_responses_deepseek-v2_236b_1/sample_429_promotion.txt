Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately interesting and good (scoring 4 and 5), which means it captures some attention but doesn't necessarily stand out. It's attractive enough to hold interest (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: While there isn't a strong intent to purchase immediately, the product is considered for future purchases (scores 2 and 3) and could be something to look into if other factors align, such as price or brand reputation.
