Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive as the advertisement's focus on staying energized and looking one's best aligns with the need for stability and care in appearance.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly more positive because it suggests a practical benefit that could be appealing, even if not overly outgoing or talkative.
  3. I believe the ad is good (5): Positive as it implies usefulness, which aligns with the value of doing a thorough job and potentially being helpful to others.
  4. I find the ad attractive (6): Moderately positive because while reserved, there's an appreciation for practical solutions that could contribute to personal well-being.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Low intention as there is no strong agreement on making plans and following through with them, which would typically be required for a purchasing decision.
  2. I will try to buy this product (2): Slightly higher than intending but still cautious due to the reserved nature and lack of commitment to follow-through with plans.
  3. I will consider buying this product (4): Moderate consideration as it's in line with personal care, which is important for someone who values thoroughness and may worry a lot about their appearance or energy levels.
