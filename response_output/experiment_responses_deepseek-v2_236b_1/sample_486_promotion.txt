Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is considered moderately interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 6), which aligns with being outgoing and sociable. It's seen as good (score 5) but not particularly liked (score 3). This reflects a neutral to slightly positive view of the ad without strong personal attachment or dislike.
- **Purchase intention:** There is minimal intent to purchase the product immediately (score 1), which could be due to being cautious and not generally trusting. However, there's an indication that it might be tried in the future (score 2) and considered for a potential purchase (score 4). This suggests some openness but also reservation about making immediate buying decisions based on this ad.
