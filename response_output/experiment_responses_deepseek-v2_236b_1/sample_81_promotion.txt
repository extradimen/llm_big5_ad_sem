Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is moderately appealing to me. I find it somewhat interesting (score 4) and good (score 5), which means it's not bad but also doesn't stand out as exceptional. It is attractive enough to catch my attention, though not overwhelmingly so (score 4).
- Purchase intention: While the ad has caught my interest to some extent, my purchase intention is low. I don't strongly intend to buy this product (score 1), but it might be something I would consider if other factors such as health benefits or recommendations from trusted sources come into play (score 3). The "try" score of 2 indicates a slightly higher likelihood than the initial reaction, suggesting that with more information or persuasion, my intention could increase.
