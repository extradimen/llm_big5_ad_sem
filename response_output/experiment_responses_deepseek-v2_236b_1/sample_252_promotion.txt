Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it somewhat interesting (4) and think it's good (5), but not particularly attractive to me personally (2). The liking score is in the middle (3), indicating a neutral stance.
- Purchase Intention: While I might consider buying the product (2), there isn't a strong intention to purchase right away (1) or an immediate plan to try it out (1). This reflects my cautious approach towards trying new products, even if the ad is moderately appealing.
