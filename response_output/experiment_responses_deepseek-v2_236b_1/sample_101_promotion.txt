Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad. (Score: 3) - Neutral leaning towards positive; it's not particularly appealing but also not off-putting.
  2. I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4) - Mildly interested, as an outgoing person, there might be some curiosity about products that claim to help stay energized and look one's best.
  3. I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5) - Slightly above neutral; while it doesn't stand out as exceptional, it conveys a clear message which can be seen as positive.
  4. I find the ad attractive. (Score: 2) - Below neutral; there isn't enough artistic or imaginative appeal to make the advertisement particularly attractive based on my personality traits.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree; as an older individual with a postgraduate degree, the claims of staying energized and looking one's best might not align strongly with personal priorities or beliefs in such products.
  2. I will try to buy this product. (Score: 2) - Disagree; while there may be some consideration due to curiosity as an outgoing person, the lack of strong agreement on the ad's attractiveness reduces the likelihood of actively seeking out the product.
  3. I will consider buying this product. (Score: 3) - Neutral; it falls in line with my helpful and unselfish nature to at least think about a product that might benefit others, even if personal interest is not high.
