Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. While it's not particularly compelling or original (score 3 for 'I like the ad' and 'I think the ad is good'), it does catch my attention enough to find it somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase the product is low. While I might consider buying this product if other factors such as price, availability, and reviews align favorably (score 3), there's no strong intent or immediate plan to try it right away (score 1) nor a definitive decision to purchase it in the near future (score 2).
