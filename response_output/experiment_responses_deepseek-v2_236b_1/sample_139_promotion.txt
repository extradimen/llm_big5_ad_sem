Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly appealing or unappealing to me, hence the mixed scores ranging from mildly agreeing that it is good and attractive (scores 2 and 5), but with a more neutral stance on whether I like it or find it interesting (scores 3 and 4).
- Purchase intention: While the ad doesn't strongly persuade me to buy the product, it does prompt some consideration. The score of 1 indicates minimal intent to purchase, 2 suggests that I might make an effort to try it if there are other factors like a recommendation or a good deal, and 3 shows that I am open to considering the product in the future.
