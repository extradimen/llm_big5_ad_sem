Explanation:
- I like the ad (score of 4): Neutral to slightly positive attitude. The ad appeals to me somewhat due to its promise of energy and looking my best, which aligns with my outgoing nature and desire to present well.
- I think the ad is interesting (score of 5): Slightly more than neutral because it does offer a claim that could be relevant for someone who values sociability and energy levels.
- I believe the ad is good (score of 5): Neutral to positive as it communicates a clear benefit, although skepticism due to my general trusting score being low.
- I find the ad attractive (score of 3): Slightly below neutral because while it has a promise that could be appealing, there's also a sense of caution about whether the product can deliver on its claims.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score of 2): Low intent because although I might consider buying based on the ad's message, my income and potential skepticism towards the effectiveness of the drink would likely prevent me from immediately committing to a purchase.
- I will try to buy this product (score of 1): Very low intent as I am more reserved in spending and may not be fully convinced by the advertisement alone.
- I will consider buying this product (score of 3): Moderate consideration because while there is some interest, other factors such as income level and trustworthiness of claims would play a significant role in my final decision.
