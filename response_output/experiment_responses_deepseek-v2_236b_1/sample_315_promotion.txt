Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a somewhat positive attitude towards the ad. It is interesting and good to some extent (scoring 4 and 5 respectively), but not particularly attractive or likable for me personally (scoring 2 and 3).
- Purchase intention: While the ad does catch my attention, it doesn't necessarily mean that I would immediately intend to purchase the product (score of 1). However, I might try to buy this product if there are other factors in play like recommendations from friends or a good deal (score of 2), and I will consider buying the product if all other aspects align with my needs and preferences (score of 3).
