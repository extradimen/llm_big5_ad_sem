Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a reserved individual who is not particularly outgoing or talkative, I find that the ad's claim to help stay energized and look one's best resonates with my practical side. The ad seems to offer a solution for daily energy without making exaggerated claims, which aligns with my tendency to make plans and follow through with them. However, as someone who is not very sociable or outgoing, I am not particularly drawn to the advertisement on an emotional level; hence, my scores are moderately positive but not strongly affirmative.
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad does present a product that could potentially be useful for maintaining energy throughout the day, my cautious nature and tendency to worry make me less inclined to immediately purchase the product without further research or consideration. My scores reflect this hesitance, with low intent to buy immediately but an openness to consider it in the future after more information is gathered.
