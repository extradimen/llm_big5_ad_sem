Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad somewhat attractive (6) and interesting (5), but my belief in its goodness is moderate (3). My like for the ad is neutral leaning towards positive (4).
- Purchase Intention Scores: While I don't strongly intend to purchase the product, I am open to trying it out (1), which means I might give it a chance. However, my actual consideration of buying it is only moderately high (3), indicating that while interested, there are other factors at play that could affect my decision.
