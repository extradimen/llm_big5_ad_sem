Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is seen as somewhat interesting (score 4) and moderately good (score 3), but not particularly attractive to me personally (score 2). I neither strongly like nor dislike it; hence a neutral score for liking (score 3).
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad does not resonate deeply with my personal values or preferences, it is not off-putting either. Therefore, while I am not immediately inclined to purchase the product (score 1), if presented with an opportunity to try it at no significant cost, I might consider doing so (score 1). However, beyond a trial offer, there isn't enough appeal for me to actively seek out and buy the product (score 2).
