Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. The ad is interesting and attractive to me as it promises energy and looking my best, which aligns with my outgoing nature (Agree on being sociable) and desire for originality (Neutral on coming up with new ideas). However, since I am generally trusting but also aware of potential manipulation in ads, my scores are not extremely high.
- Purchase Intention Scores: While the ad is somewhat appealing, my intention to purchase or even consider buying the product is low. This is because as a civil servant, I prioritize thoroughness and trustworthiness (Agree on doing a thorough job), but at the same time, I am aware of my tendency towards carelessness (Strongly Agree) which might lead me to impulsive decisions that I later regret due to lack of planning (Disagree on making plans and following through). Therefore, my scores reflect cautiousness in purchasing decisions.
