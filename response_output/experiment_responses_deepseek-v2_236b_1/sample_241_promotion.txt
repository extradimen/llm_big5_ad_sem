Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, as it speaks to staying energized, which is a common need. However, my skepticism (Strongly Disagree with being generally trusting) makes me cautious about claims of looking one's best every day, so my scores are not very high.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding elements of the ad appealing, my worry and nervousness lead to a more careful approach to purchasing decisions, hence the low scores for purchase intentions. I would likely consider it but with reservations due to my tendency to be thorough (which contradicts my claim of being careless).
