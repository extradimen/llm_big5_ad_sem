Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I am somewhat neutral to reserved in my approach. The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is moderately appealing but not particularly compelling given my personality traits that lean towards being more cautious and less trusting.
  - "I like the ad." (2): While it doesn't strongly resonate with me, I don't dislike it either.
  - "I think the ad is interesting." (3): It has a claim that could be of interest to some people, but not particularly engaging for someone who is reserved and skeptical.
  - "I believe the ad is good." (3): The ad seems to fulfill its purpose as an advertisement without any immediate negative impressions.
  - "I find the ad attractive." (4): It's a moderately attractive proposition for those interested in energy and appearance, though not overly so for me personally.

- **Purchase intention**: Given my personality traits of being untrusting and generally thorough, I would approach purchasing decisions with caution. The advertisement doesn't inspire strong confidence or trust that the product will deliver on its promises.
  - "I intend to purchase this product." (1): There is no immediate desire to buy based on the ad alone.
  - "I will try to buy this product." (2): It would require more information and possibly a personal recommendation before considering trying it out.
  - "I will consider buying this product." (3): While not dismissing the possibility, there is no strong inclination to seriously consider purchasing without further evaluation.
