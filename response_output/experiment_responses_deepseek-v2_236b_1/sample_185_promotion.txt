Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4) and it does catch my interest to a moderate extent (score 5). While not convinced that it is particularly good (score 3), I do think it has an attractive quality, especially in terms of its promise for energy and appearance enhancement (score 6).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Given my profile as a civil servant with a focus on thoroughness at work, the ad's claim about staying energized aligns somewhat with my professional needs. Therefore, I might consider purchasing it if it were within my budget range (score 3), and possibly try to buy it if reviews are favorable or recommendations come from trusted sources (score 1). However, without more information on its effectiveness or specific benefits, my intention to purchase is not strong at this point (score 2).
