Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude Scores: As a reserved individual who is not particularly outgoing or talkative (Disagree to Neutral on those traits), the advertisement's focus on staying energized and looking one's best does not strongly resonate with me. However, I am helpful and unselfish (Agree) which might make me appreciate an ad that could potentially benefit others. Thus, my scores reflect a moderate level of interest in the ad's attractiveness (5), but less agreement on its goodness (2) or how much I like it (3). The interesting aspect gets a 4 because while not particularly compelling to me personally, it does have an appeal that could be intriguing for others.
- Purchase Intention Scores: Given my demographic profile and personality traits, such as being single with a lower income and having strong nervousness and worry tendencies (Strongly Agree), I am less likely to make impulse purchases or buy products based on promises of energy and appearance enhancement. Therefore, my intention to purchase the product is low (1). However, if there was significant promotion or persuasion from trusted sources, I might consider it more (3) or even try to buy it (2), but these scores still reflect a cautious approach due to financial constraints and personal skepticism about such claims.
