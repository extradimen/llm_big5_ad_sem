Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately interesting (score 4) and somewhat good in quality (score 5), but it doesn't particularly attract or appeal to me (score 2). I have a neutral stance on whether I like the ad, hence score 3.
- **Purchase intention**: While there might be some interest due to the claim of staying energized, my overall attitude towards the advertisement is not strong enough to consider purchasing the product immediately (score 1), but it doesn't rule out the possibility that I could try or consider buying it in the future if other factors come into play (scores 2 and 3).
