Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 5), which is likely due to my original nature and tendency to come up with new ideas. However, I am not strongly convinced that it is a good ad (score 3) or that I particularly like it (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad captures some attention, my purchase intentions are not high. I would consider buying the product (score 3), but I do not have strong plans to try to buy it (score 1) or an immediate intent to purchase (score 2). This is likely influenced by my reserved nature and tendency to worry a lot, which may make me cautious about new products without more information.
