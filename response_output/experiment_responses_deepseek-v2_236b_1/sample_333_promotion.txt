Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I have a generally positive attitude towards the advertisement. It's attractive to me as an outgoing person who likes staying energized (score of 4 for 'attractive'). The claim that it helps look one's best aligns with my desire to be sociable and presentable, hence finding it interesting (score of 5). However, I am skeptical about whether a drink can truly deliver on these promises, so my belief in the ad being good is moderate (score of 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase the product is low. While the advertisement has caught my attention and I might consider it (score of 3), I am not fully convinced to try it yet (score of 1) or strongly intend to buy it immediately (score of 2). This reflects my cautious approach towards making plans and following through with them, as well as a tendency to be careful about spending given my income level.
