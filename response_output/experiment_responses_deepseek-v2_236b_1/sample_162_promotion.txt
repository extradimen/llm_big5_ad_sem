Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a neutral to slightly positive view on the ad. It's not particularly attractive or interesting to me personally, but it doesn't offend my values or preferences either. The claim about staying energized and looking one's best is somewhat appealing, though not strongly so.
- Purchase intention: My scores indicate low interest in purchasing the product. While I might consider buying it if there are other factors (such as a recommendation from someone I trust), at this moment, my intention to buy or even try the product is quite low. This could be due to various reasons such as budget constraints, lack of perceived need for an energy drink, or skepticism about its advertised benefits.
