Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and attractive (score 4), as it appeals to my desire to feel energized. It's also considered good (score 5) because it communicates a clear benefit, but I do not strongly like it (score 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is somewhat appealing, my intention to purchase (score 2) and consider buying (score 4) are moderate. The reason for this could be due to skepticism about whether a drink can truly deliver on its promises or because of personal preferences that may not align with consuming such products.
