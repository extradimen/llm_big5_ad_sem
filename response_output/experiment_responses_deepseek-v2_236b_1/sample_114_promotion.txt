Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat liked (score 4), and it's considered interesting enough to hold attention (score 5). It's seen as a good promotion overall (score 6), but not particularly attractive in terms of visuals or emotional appeal (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: There's an intent to consider the product for purchase, which is indicated by score 2. However, it doesn't imply immediate action; rather, it suggests that if the opportunity arises and other factors align, such as price and need, then there might be a try of the product (score 1). The final score in this category indicates that buying will depend on further consideration (score 3), which reflects a cautious approach to purchasing decisions.
