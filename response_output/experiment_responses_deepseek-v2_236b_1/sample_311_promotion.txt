Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a manager with an outgoing personality and strong agreement on coming up with new ideas, I find the ad somewhat appealing (score of 3 for liking it) due to its creative approach. It's interesting enough to capture my attention (4), good in terms of presentation (5), and attractive as it aligns with my need to stay energized for work (6).
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad is engaging, my intention to purchase the product isn't immediate (2) but I will try to gather more information about it (3), and considering its potential benefits, I might contemplate buying it if it meets my expectations regarding energy boost (4). However, my skepticism towards trusting others (Disagree on being generally trusting) may require strong evidence of the drink's effectiveness before any actual purchase.
