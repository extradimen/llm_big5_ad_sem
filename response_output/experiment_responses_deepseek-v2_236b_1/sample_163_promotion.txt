Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a male in his sixties with an outgoing personality and general trust in others, I find the ad somewhat interesting (4) because it speaks to staying energized, which could be appealing. However, while I am not particularly artistic or original in my interests, the claim of looking one's best every day is attractive (5), as maintaining a good appearance can be important for social interactions. The overall likeability and goodness of the ad are moderately positive at 3 out of 7.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding some aspects of the ad appealing, my purchase intentions are not very high due to other priorities and perhaps skepticism about the product's claims. I am open to considering it (3), but making an immediate effort to buy or a strong intent to purchase is low at 1 and 2 respectively.
