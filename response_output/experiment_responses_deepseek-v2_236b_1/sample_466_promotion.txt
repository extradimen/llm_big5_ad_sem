Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive feeling about the advertisement. It's not particularly compelling but it has some appeal.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): The claim of staying energized and looking one's best daily piques my interest as an outgoing person who values sociability.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): While there is a certain level of skepticism due to being generally trusting, the overall message seems positive but not particularly convincing.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): The promise of looking one's best every day resonates with my outgoing nature and desire to be sociable, making it more appealing than other aspects of the ad.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): There is a moderate level of interest in trying out the product due to its claim of energy enhancement, but not a strong commitment to buy immediately.
- I will try to buy this product (score 3): It's something that might be considered for future purchases if other factors align, such as price and availability.
- I will consider buying this product (score 4): The consideration is there due to the potential benefits mentioned in the ad, but it's not a high priority purchase at the moment.
