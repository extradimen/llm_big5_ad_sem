Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I like the ad to a moderate extent (5) as it appeals to my outgoing and sociable nature. It is somewhat interesting (4), but not particularly outstanding in terms of content or creativity. However, I find it good enough (3) without being exceptional, and attractive (6) because it speaks to staying energized and looking one's best, which aligns with my desire to maintain an active lifestyle despite my busy civil servant role.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: My intention to purchase this product is low at the moment (1), but I might consider trying out the product if there are promotions or discounts available (2). The ad has not convinced me enough to make a definite decision, so I will keep it in mind for consideration (3) when making future purchasing decisions.
