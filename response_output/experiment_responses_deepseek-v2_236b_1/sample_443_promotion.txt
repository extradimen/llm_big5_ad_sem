Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I moderately like the ad (score 5), find it somewhat interesting (score 4), but only think of it as average or not particularly impressive (score 3). The attractiveness of the ad is low for me, hence a score of 2. This reflects my reserved nature and neutral stance on artistic interests.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I do not strongly intend to purchase this product based on the advertisement alone (score 1), there's still a possibility that I might consider it in the future if other factors, such as personal need or recommendations from others, come into play (score 2). However, my current intention is low due to my reserved nature and preference for being thorough with decisions.
