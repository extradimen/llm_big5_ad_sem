Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a reserved and not particularly outgoing individual, I am more skeptical about advertisements that claim to provide energy and enhance appearance. The ad does not strongly resonate with my personal interests or needs, hence the mixed response in liking (3), finding it interesting (4), but only moderately attractive (2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the advertisement is not particularly persuasive for me personally, I am open to considering new products that could potentially improve my well-being. However, due to my cautious nature and thorough approach to decision-making, I would likely do more research before committing to a purchase, hence low scores on immediate intention (1) and willingness to try (2), but slightly higher score on consideration (3).
