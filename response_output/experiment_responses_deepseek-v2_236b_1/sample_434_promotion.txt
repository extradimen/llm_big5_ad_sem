Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is considered moderately interesting and attractive (scoring 4 and 5), which means it captures some attention but does not strongly resonate with all personality traits. It's viewed as good enough to hold interest, hence a score of 3 for "good" and another 3 for "like," indicating that while it doesn't excite personal preferences, it is neither unlikable nor particularly engaging.
- **Purchase intention**: The scores here indicate moderate consideration (2 for intend, 3 for try, and 4 for consider). This suggests a willingness to entertain the idea of purchasing but without strong commitment or urgency. Factors such as income level (<15,000,000 VND) might play a role in this cautious approach towards spending on energy drinks, aligning with the profile's more reserved attitude toward personal consumption and financial prudence.
