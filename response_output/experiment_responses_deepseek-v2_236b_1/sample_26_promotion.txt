Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly appealing or unappealing to me, hence a score between agree and neutral for liking it (4), finding it interesting (3), and considering it good (3). However, the attractiveness of the ad is relatively low as I have few artistic interests and am reserved in my preferences (2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite having a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement, my purchase intention is low. This could be due to several factors such as my skepticism ("I am generally trusting": Strongly Disagree), being more focused on doing a thorough job rather than energy drinks, or simply not feeling that this product aligns with my needs despite considering it (1, 2, and 3).
