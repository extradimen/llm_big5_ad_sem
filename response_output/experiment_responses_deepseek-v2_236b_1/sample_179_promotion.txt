Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it somewhat appealing (score of 3 for liking), moderately interesting (score of 4), and good in quality (score of 4). The ad is attractive to me as a potential consumer who values energy and appearance, which is reflected by my higher score of 5.
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad has caught my attention, I am not yet fully committed to purchasing the product (score of 2 for intending), but I will try to look into it further (score of 3). It's likely that I would consider buying this product after evaluating its actual benefits and comparing with other options on the market (score of 4).
