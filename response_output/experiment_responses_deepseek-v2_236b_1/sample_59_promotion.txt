Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral leaning towards agreement because while it's not particularly engaging for me personally, it does convey a clear message about energy and appearance which could be appealing to others.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Agree slightly as it targets an aspect that many consumers may find relevantâ€”staying energized and looking their best.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Neutral leaning towards agreement, acknowledging its straightforward approach but without any personal resonance.
  4. I find the ad attractive (5): Slightly more than neutral as it speaks to a universal desire for energy and appearance enhancement.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (2): Leaning towards considering it due to the benefits mentioned, but not fully committed without further information or personal need at present.
  2. I will try to buy this product (3): Will consider buying based on its claims about energy and appearance benefits if there is a demonstrated need for such a product in my daily routine.
  3. I will consider buying this product (3): Similar to the previous score, indicating that while it's not an immediate intention, it could become relevant under certain circumstances or after more information becomes available.
