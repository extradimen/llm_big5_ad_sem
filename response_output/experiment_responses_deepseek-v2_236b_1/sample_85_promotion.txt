Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately interesting and somewhat attractive, but my overall opinion is neutral to slightly positive. The ad claims that the drink helps with energy and appearance, which are not top priorities for me at this stage in life, but they could be appealing to a younger demographic.
- Purchase intention: While I may consider the product if it's available, I don't have a strong desire to seek it out or make an effort to purchase it. The ad doesn't resonate strongly with my personal values and needs, so my intent to buy is low.
