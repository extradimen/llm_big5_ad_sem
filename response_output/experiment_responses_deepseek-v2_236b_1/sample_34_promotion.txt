Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4), finds it somewhat interesting (score 5), believes it's good (score 6), but only mildly attractive (score 3). This suggests a mixed response where there is some positive engagement with the content, but not an overwhelming attraction.
- **Purchase intention**: The intent to purchase is low (score 2) as "try" indicates willingness without commitment, while considering buying it has more weight (score 4), showing that it's on the radar for potential future purchases.
