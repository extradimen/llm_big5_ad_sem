Explanation:
- I moderately like the ad (score 4) as it seems to align with my outgoing and sociable nature.
- The ad is somewhat interesting to me (score 5), especially since it claims to help stay energized for social interactions.
- However, I only think the ad is fairly good (score 3), considering my reserved attitude towards advertising in general.
- I find the ad quite attractive (score 6) because of its promise to look one's best, which resonates with me as someone who values appearance and energy for social activities.

As for purchase intention:
- Although the ad is moderately appealing, I do not strongly intend to purchase this product right away (score 2).
- I might try to buy it if there are special offers or discounts that make it more financially feasible (score 1), given my blue-collar income.
- Ultimately, I will consider buying the product, taking into account its actual benefits and value for money (score 3).
