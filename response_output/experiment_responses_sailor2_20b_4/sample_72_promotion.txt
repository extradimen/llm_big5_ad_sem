**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (3) - As a civil servant with strong planning but sometimes careless tendencies, I find it functional yet not particularly engaging.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Slightly Agree (4) – The claim of staying energized resonates with my active lifestyle but lacks novelty to capture sustained interest.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Somewhat Positive (5) – It's credible, but could be more detailed or personalized for maximum impact.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (2) – The appeal falls short due to lack of emotional connection and distinctiveness.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - My cautious nature, combined with a preference for thorough verification before making purchases, makes me unlikely to impulsively buy.
- **Will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my tendency towards carefulness and emotional stability issues, attempting the purchase seems low on my priority list.
- **Consider buying this product:** Disagree (2) - Though not dismissing it entirely, I need more concrete evidence or a compelling reason beyond general promises to seriously consider making an investment in this beverage. 

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's functional goals and its decent appeal, stronger elements such as personal relevance, detailed benefits, and trustworthiness would be needed for me to align with higher purchase intentions.
