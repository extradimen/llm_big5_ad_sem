**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *Like:* Neutral leaning towards Agree because while the ad resonates with my values of being energetic (since it promises "stay energized"), its appeal doesn't overwhelmingly hit home given my daily routine isn’t solely focused on appearances.
  - *Interesting:* Strongly Agree. The promise of energy and looking good every day is intriguing, capturing my attention as a student seeking extra drive.
  - *Good:* Agree. It presents an appealing blend of functionality (energizing) and aesthetic benefits, which aligns well with modern health-conscious attitudes.
  - *Attractive:* Neutral/Disagree slightly; while visually engaging ads can sway me, the specific appeal here needs to be complemented by practicality in my budget-constrained lifestyle.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend:* Slightly Disagree (2). The ad is persuasive but doesn't instantly convert into a purchase decision due to cost considerations within my monthly income range.
  - *Try:* Agree. I'm open-minded and might give it a try, especially if friends or peers recommend the product.
  - *Consider:* Strongly Agree (5). Despite reservations about immediate purchase, I'll definitely keep this option in mind for future needs—balancing between benefits and financial constraints.

Overall, while the ad is engaging and aligns with modern aspirations, practical concerns influence my purchasing behavior directly but not decisively. Hence, a balanced score reflecting both appeal and consideration.
