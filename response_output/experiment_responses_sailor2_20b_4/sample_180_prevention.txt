**Evaluation Details:**

**Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like**: While I appreciate its message about preventing tiredness and dull appearance, it feels somewhat manipulative (Score = 3).
2. **Interesting**: The concept is straightforward but not particularly engaging or innovative (Score = 4).
3. **Good**: It effectively communicates a need for the product, though it's basic and lacks depth (Score = 5).
4. **Attractive**: Personally, I find this ad to be moderately appealing visually and emotionally (Score = 2).

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend**: Given my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income), prioritizing other expenses over a non-essential product like this isnâ€™t likely (Score = 1).
2. **Try to Buy**: I might consider trying it during special offers or discounts but have no immediate need for such products (Score = 2).
3. **Consider Buying**: The ad does make me think about the benefits, yet my cautious nature and practicality keep this low on the priority list (Score = 2). 

In summary, while I acknowledge its persuasive aspects, they don't strongly influence my decision to purchase due to personal priorities, budget constraints, and a preference for more substantial product justification.
