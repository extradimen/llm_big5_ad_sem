**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
    - **Like (Score 3):** Neutral to slightly positive since I appreciate energy drinks for daily routines but am not particularly drawn by this ad.
    - **Interesting (Score 4):** Slightly interesting; it's a common claim and could appeal to my peers, though not groundbreaking.
    - **Good (Score 5):** Considered good because the promise of staying energized is valuable. It aligns with daily work needs but falls within expected standards for such products.
    - **Attractive (Score 2):** Not very attractive due to general saturation in the market and lack of unique features that catch my eye personally.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **Intend (Score 1):** Strongly disagree; though useful, no strong motivation or urgency for immediate purchase exists.
    - **Try (Score 1):** Disagree; I prefer tried-and-tested brands and do not feel compelled to try a new one based on this ad alone.
    - **Consider (Score 2):** Somewhat agree; if the product is offered at my workplace or during promotions, it could be worth considering alongside other options.

The overall evaluation balances practical utility with personal preference, indicating moderate interest without strong intent for an unplanned purchase. The ad meets basic needs but lacks a compelling hook to drive immediate action.
