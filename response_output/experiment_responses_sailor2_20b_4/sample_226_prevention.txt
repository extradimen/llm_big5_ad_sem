**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3): Neutral. The ad's claims are straightforward but not particularly appealing to me.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4): Somewhat Agree. It piques mild curiosity, especially for someone who values energy and appearance.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 2): Disagree. The content feels somewhat exaggerated without compelling evidence or personal relevance.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 3): Neutral. While not unattractive, it doesn't strongly resonate with my values and preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1): Strongly Disagree. Given my low income constraints and current financial priorities, a discretionary item like this is unlikely.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1): Strongly Disagree. No immediate or compelling reasons exist for me to seek it out proactively.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2): Mild Consideration. Although the ad doesn't fully convince, I may ponder its benefits if future circumstances improve my budget.

In summary, while there's a bit of engagement with the message and mild interest, practical considerations and my current lifestyle factors hold me back from strong purchase intentions or actions. The ad is neither compelling nor persuasive enough to significantly influence my buying behavior in this scenario.
