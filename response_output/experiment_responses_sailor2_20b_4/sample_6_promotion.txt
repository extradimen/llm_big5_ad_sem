**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (Neutral):** Being reserved doesn't mean I dislike it entirely; the message resonates somewhat.
   - **Interesting (Agree):** The claim of staying energized appeals to my practical side, especially as a hardworking blue-collar worker.
   - **Good (Strongly Agree):** Promoting health and appearance is aligned with societal values I respect, making me view it positively.
   - **Attractive (Disagree):** My personality leans towards trust but not necessarily being drawn in by superficial allure alone; more emphasis on credibility would help.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Despite liking the idea of staying energized and looking good, Iâ€™m cautious due to occasional carelessness and worry about spending.
   - **Try to Buy:** Curiosity is piqued but not enough for an immediate purchase; need further validation (e.g., reviews or endorsements).
   - **Consider Buying:** The overall message aligns well with my values, making it a potential option if I see practical benefits.

In summary, while the ad effectively taps into health and personal appearance goals, its attractiveness could be enhanced. My intention leans towards cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase due to balancing everyday concerns like budgeting and reliability checks.
