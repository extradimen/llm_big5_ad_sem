**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like (Score: 3):** While I appreciate its message of energy and looking good, it doesn't strongly appeal to me.
  - **Interesting (Score: 4):** The concept is engaging but not extraordinary; mildly interesting.
  - **Good (Score: 5):** It seems well-crafted with a clear benefit statement that's generally positive.
  - **Attractive (Score: 2):** As someone who tends to be reserved and less outwardly sociable, I find the "look your best" part somewhat superficial.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - **Intend (Score: 4):** The ad sparks curiosity but doesn't immediately drive a strong intention.
  - **Try (Score: 6):** There's enough interest to potentially give it a try, given its promise of energy boost and personal appearance benefits.
  - **Consider (Score: 7):** Given my practical nature and preference for thorough actions, I am open-minded about considering the product after evaluating reviews or recommendations.

Overall, while the ad holds some appeal due to its functional claims, it needs more depth in alignment with my reserved yet methodical personality. The purchase intent leans towards a thoughtful evaluation before making a final decision.
