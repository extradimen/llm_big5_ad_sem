**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 3* (Neutral)
   - Despite being a reserved individual who doesn't find social cues particularly compelling, the promise of energy and looking good might catch my attention initially but lacks personal connection.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 4* (Slightly Agree)
   - It piques curiosity with its claims about staying energized and appearance benefits, though it doesn't strongly engage me due to being more reserved in outlooks on health products.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 5* (Agree)
   - As a generally trusting person, I see this as potentially effective for many people but remain cautious about its universal truthfulness based on my personal context.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 2* (Strongly Disagree)
   - The energetic and glamorous presentation might clash with my reserved nature; thus, it doesn't visually appeal to me.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1* (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and careful spending habits, the price point likely outweighs perceived benefits.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 2* (Slightly Agree)
   - There's a small inclination due to my tendency towards thoroughness in trying new things but it quickly fades under realistic financial constraints.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 2* (Slightly Agree)
   - While not dismissing the idea entirely, practical concerns about cost and priority would likely lead me to postpone or reject purchasing at present.

In summary, while I recognize its potential value, my reserved personality combined with financial limitations results in a neutral-to-negative ad attitude and low purchase intentions. The message is good but falls short of compelling action for someone in my specific circumstances.
