   - **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3.5) It's engaging, but not particularly compelling for my daily routine.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4) Simple and straightforward message; credible product benefit.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 4) Visuals are appealing, though it could be more emotionally resonant.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) While I appreciate energy benefits, other priorities take precedence.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3) There's mild interest but not enough urgency or need driving a trial.
   - **Consider buying the product:** (Score: 3) It will be on my radar if convenience and price align better with my lifestyle.
