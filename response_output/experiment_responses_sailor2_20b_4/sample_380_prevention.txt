**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Attitude toward the Ad:**
  - **Like:** Neutral because it's not offensive but doesn't resonate with me personally.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree due to its overly simplistic message, lacking depth or novelty.
  - **Good:** Strongly Disagree since it feels manipulative by suggesting a negative consequence if you don’t use the product without credible evidence.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree; while visually acceptable, the messaging comes across as weak and unconvincing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree because the claim lacks persuasive data or trustworthiness, making me reluctant to invest money in it.
  - **Try/Buy:** Both disagree; despite being a civil servant with stable income (20–29k VND), I don’t see this product as necessary and am not convinced by its benefits without additional information.

In summary, the ad falls short on credibility, personal appeal, and effectiveness in motivating purchase intention for someone with my background and personality. Therefore, it earns low scores despite being non-offensive.
