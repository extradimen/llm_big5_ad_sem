**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Score = 2 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Being reserved and not very talkative makes me less inclined to enjoy flashy or energetic ads.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score = 3 (Neutral / Slightly Agree)
   - While it does promise benefits, my lack of imagination and outgoing nature don't find this particularly engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score = 4 (Agree)
   - The concept appeals to staying energized and looking good, which are generally positive values for many people, but not enough to resonate deeply with me personally.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score = 3 (Neutral / Slightly Agree)
   - Its aesthetics might be decent, but it doesn't excite my usual preferences or capture my attention significantly.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - My reserved and unimpressed attitude means I'm unlikely to actively seek out the product without a compelling reason tied more closely to my daily routines or budget considerations.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score = 1 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my neutral-to-negative response and financial constraints, trying it seems unnecessary.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score = 2 (Agree / Slightly Agree)
   - Though I'm not enthusiastic, if the price is reasonable within my budget of 26-35 million VND/month and there are any specific needs or offers that align with staying energized during work shifts, I might give it some thought.

Overall, while this ad presents appealing promises, its messaging does not strongly connect with my reserved nature, personality traits, or immediate priorities. Thus, the intention to purchase remains low.
