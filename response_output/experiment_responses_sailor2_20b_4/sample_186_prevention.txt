**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score: 4)** - While I appreciate its straightforward approach to addressing fatigue, my reserved nature might cause me to be slightly indifferent.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)** - The message isn't groundbreaking but adequately conveys a common issue, keeping it mildly engaging for someone like me who values direct communication.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 5)** - Given my strong agreement with general trust and emotional stability, I find it honest in presenting potential benefits without being overly aggressive.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 2)** - The appeal is moderate; as a reserved individual, I am not particularly drawn to high-impact visual or emotional ads.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 1)** - Despite my talkativeness and active imagination, current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make me less likely to commit immediately.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 2)** - Thereâ€™s a small inclination due to the ad's credibility but not enough motivation without further incentives or trials.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 3)** - It registers as an option, especially if there are future needs for boosting energy levels or during times when budget allows.

In summary, while I appreciate the straightforward and believable nature of the ad, my reserved demeanor and financial limitations temper both interest and purchase intention. The scores reflect a balanced but cautious outlook from someone with similar demographic and personality traits.
