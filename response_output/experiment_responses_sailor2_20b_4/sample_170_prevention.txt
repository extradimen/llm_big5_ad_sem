**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad:** (Score = 3): The appeal is moderate; it resonates somewhat with my need for energy and appearance but not strongly.
   - **Interesting:** (Score = 4): Finds the message intriguing, highlighting common concerns about fatigue and dullness.
   - **Good:** (Score = 5): Sees value in its straightforward messaging regarding health benefits.
   - **Attractive:** (Score = 2): While useful, it doesn't stand out as visually or emotionally engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 4): Not strongly driven by the ad alone but acknowledges potential usefulness in daily life.
   - **Will try to buy this product:** (Score = 4): Slightly higher intention because I appreciate preventive measures, though not compelled instantly.
   - **Consider buying this product:** (Score = 6): Despite reservations about marketing strategies, the concern for energy levels and appearance encourages me to seriously consider it.

Overall, the ad is moderately effective in raising awareness but falls short on strong emotional or immediate purchase motivation. Practical benefits align somewhat with my preferences and lifestyle.
