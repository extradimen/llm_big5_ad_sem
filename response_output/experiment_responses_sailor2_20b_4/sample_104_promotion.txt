**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (Score = 3):** While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, my personal needs don't align strongly with these benefits.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** The ad’s promise is intriguing but not overwhelmingly so for someone like me who values more practical applications in daily life.
  - **Good (Score = 5):** On the neutral to slightly positive side; it's presented well and might appeal to others, though I'm reserved about its overall impact on my lifestyle.
  - **Attractive (Score = 2):** Given my personality traits of being sometimes rude and getting nervous easily, I find this ad less personally attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (Score = 1):** Strongly disagree. My current budget constraints make it impractical to add such products frequently.
  - **Try (Score = 2):** Neutral but leaning towards unlikely; given my careful spending habits and other priorities, trying the product seems low on the list.
  - **Consider (Score = 3):** I am open to considering if a special occasion or lower price point presents itself, balancing its perceived benefits against practical needs.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad’s potential appeal, personal circumstances and preferences mean it's not highly compelling for me.
