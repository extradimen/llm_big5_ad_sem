**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (4/7):** Neutral to positive; the ad's message is relevant but not particularly appealing.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The premise of avoiding fatigue and dullness resonates, but it lacks a compelling hook.
   - **Good (5/7):** Perceived as informative with valid concerns about tiredness, though could be better executed for stronger impact.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** Minimal visual or emotional draw; feels more functional than engaging.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Moderate interest (2/7); useful benefits are acknowledged but not enough to drive an immediate buying decision.
   - **Will try the product:** Some willingness to consider a trial (3/7), aligning with helpful and practical inclinations.
   - **Consider purchasing:** Balanced consideration (4/7) despite reservations, indicating potential future action if other factors align.

Overall, while the advertisement addresses real concerns about daily fatigue effectively, its presentation falls short on engagement and attractiveness. My balanced personality leans towards cautious yet pragmatic decision-making, leading to moderate positive attitudes with corresponding intention scores for purchase contemplation rather than immediate commitment.
