   - **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)**: The concept appeals to modern needs but doesn't captivate me deeply due to personal preferences.
   - **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)**: It's effective in conveying a clear message, though it might not align perfectly with my values or lifestyle choices.
   - **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)**: The visual and emotional appeal are average; Iâ€™m more drawn to substance over flashy presentation.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**: While there's some consideration, my practical mindset prioritizes evidence of efficacy.
   - **I will try to buy this product (Score: 4)**: I'm open-minded and may give it a shot based on positive reviews or recommendations from peers.
   - **I will consider buying the product (Score: 5)**: It fits into potential future plans, especially if aligned with my healthy lifestyle goals but not an immediate priority.
