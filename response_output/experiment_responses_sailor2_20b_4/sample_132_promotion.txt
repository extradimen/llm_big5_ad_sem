**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3):**
   - While I appreciate its purpose to promote energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't resonate deeply due to my reserved nature and lack of excitement for such products.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4):**
   - The concept of staying energized appeals on a practical level, but without strong emotional engagement or personal relevance, I find it moderately intriguing rather than highly captivating.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2):**
   - Though functional claims are sound, my skepticism and general distrust make me question its credibility, lowering appreciation for the ad itself.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 5):**
   - Despite being somewhat cautious, I acknowledge that a well-designed presentation can be appealing. The visual elements may attract attention but do not elicit strong emotional connection.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1):**
   - Given my conservative and sometimes rudeness tendencies, coupled with limited trust in marketing promises, there's no immediate intention to buy without further evidence or personal necessity.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3):**
   - Curiosity might prompt a trial purchase if the price is reasonable for my income range of 16-25 million VND per month and convenience allows, but it won't be an impulse decision.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2):**
   - While I'm not dismissive, the balanced approach to evaluating needs, budget, and potential benefits places consideration at a middle groundâ€”open but not enthusiastic.

In summary, while the ad effectively presents its selling points, my reserved nature, skepticism, and practical inclinations result in moderate engagement without strong purchase intent. A more tailored appeal or proven testimonials might sway me further.
