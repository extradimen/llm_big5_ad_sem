**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (score = 3):** While I appreciate its intent to highlight potential drawbacks without the product, it doesn't particularly resonate with me.
   - **Interesting (score = 4):** The ad is moderately engaging as it addresses common concerns about energy levels and appearance.
   - **Good (score = 5):** It's well-crafted in terms of message clarity but lacks emotional depth for my tastes.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** I find the appeal somewhat weak; it feels more like a functional benefit claim rather than emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my strong preference for thoroughness and reliability, plus the clear benefits stated (energized feeling, improved appearance), there's a high likelihood of intent (score = 6).
   - **Will Try to Buy:** My tendency towards trust (Strongly Agree) and plan-following behavior encourages me to give it a try if presented with adequate information (score = 7).
   - **Consider Buying:** While I find the ad persuasive, my practical nature means I will carefully consider factors like price, reviews, and personal needs before making a final decision (score = 5).

Overall, though the advertisement is reasonably effective in conveying its message, there's room for improvement in emotional engagement to fully resonate with someone of my background and personality. Nonetheless, it does push me towards considering or attempting the purchase due to practical benefits emphasized.
