**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
    - **Like (3)**: The ad is somewhat appealing but doesn't capture my full interest.
    - **Interesting (4)**: It presents a general message that many would find engaging; thus, moderately interesting.
    - **Good (5)**: I appreciate the claim of staying energized and looking good, which aligns with common wellness goals. Hence, it's considered decent but not outstanding.
    - **Attractive (2)**: Due to my strong anxiety about making decisions quickly and my neutral feeling towards energy drinks, the ad doesn't appear very attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
    - **Intend (2)**: Despite valuing wellness, I have reservations due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and a preference for more thorough consideration.
    - **Try (1)**: Low likelihood of trying the product immediately; my cautious nature prevents me from making spur-of-the-moment purchases.
    - **Consider (2)**: There's some room to consider it as part of future wellness plans, but I need further information or a compelling reason tied more closely to personal needs and budget.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat positive in its approach, my personality traits lead me towards cautious consumption habits and an emphasis on thorough evaluation before making purchases. This results in moderately favorable yet guarded attitudes toward both the advertisement itself and potential purchase intention.
