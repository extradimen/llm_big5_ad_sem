**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (5):** The energetic and appearance-focused message might appeal to my social nature (Strongly Agree), but it feels a bit superficial.
   - **Interesting (4):** While not groundbreaking, it's intriguing enough given its promise of energy and looking good daily. 
   - **Good (3):** Neutral balance; the ad is reasonably well-crafted but lacks strong emotional connection or novelty for me.
   - **Attractive (2):** Not particularly compelling visually or emotionally due to my preference for originality over generic messaging.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) — Despite being talkative and outgoing, the promise of instant energy doesn't align with my practical nature. The lack of thorough job performance indicates skepticism about long-term effectiveness.
   - **Try to buy:** 2 (Disagree slightly) — There's some curiosity, but no strong motivation or trust in quick results from just one product.
   - **Consider buying:** 3 (Neutral leaning towards Disagree) — I acknowledge the convenience factor for daily use and might give it a thought if other factors align better.

In summary, while I appreciate its message of being energized and looking good, my cautious approach to products and lack of immediate appeal result in moderate interest but low intention to purchase.
