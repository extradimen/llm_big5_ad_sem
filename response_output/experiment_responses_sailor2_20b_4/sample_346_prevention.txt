**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad:** 6 - Neutral leaning towards slightly positive. The statement resonates with my experience of energy and appearance being linked to daily activities.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** 5 - Agreeable, as it taps into common concerns about fatigue and personal presentation.

- **I believe the ad is good:** 4 - Slightly agree; while effective in raising awareness, it lacks deeper engagement or emotional appeal for me personally.

- **I find the ad attractive:** 3 - Disagree. While practical, its straightforward approach isn't enough to captivate my attention given my strong imagination and active mind looking for more creative content.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Disagree) – Despite acknowledging fatigue issues, there are existing solutions I prefer or trust already.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** 1 (Strongly Disagree) – The lack of urgency and personal relevance means it doesn't push me towards immediate action.

- **I will consider buying this product:** 2 (Disagree leaning Neutral) – While not ruling out future consideration, the ad's message isn’t compelling enough for a quick buy decision given my current preferences and lifestyle choices. 

In summary, while I appreciate its practicality, other factors from my personality and existing habits outweigh this advertisement’s influence on immediate or considered purchase intent.
