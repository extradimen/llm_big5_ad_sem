**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 4)** - While not strongly positive, I find it somewhat appealing as it directly addresses common daily issues like fatigue and appearance.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 5)** - The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making the ad intriguing to a degree.

3. **Good (Score: 3)** - It’s passable in terms of being informative, but lacks depth or innovative messaging that would make it stand out significantly.
   
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - The appeal isn't strong enough given my reserved and somewhat cautious nature; the ad feels a bit too generic.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase** (Score: 1) - Despite understanding its relevance, I'm not inclined to buy immediately due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month).
   
2. **Will try to buy** (Score: 2) - There's a mild curiosity, but my cautious and unselfish nature means trying the product is low priority without further compelling reasons.

3. **Consider buying** (Score: 3) – I’ll keep it in mind if future needs arise or more information convinces me of its efficacy; otherwise, it’s on the periphery for now.

Overall, while the ad resonates mildly with my experiences and values, there's not enough persuasiveness to drive a strong purchase intent due to budget limitations and personal preferences.
