**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (2)**: The tagline is straightforward but doesn't resonate deeply with my reserved nature; it lacks a personal connection.
   - **Interesting (3)**: It’s informative and relevant, making it moderately interesting due to its clear message about energy and appearance.
   - **Good (4)**: While not groundbreaking, the ad effectively communicates potential benefits—preventing fatigue and improving alertness which aligns with my desire for thoroughness in personal care.
   - **Attractive (5)**: It’s functional rather than visually appealing; I find it acceptable but not strongly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (6)**: Given the focus on performance and efficacy, along with my meticulous approach, I'm inclined towards trying a drink that promises these effects.
   - **Will try to buy this product (7)**: There's enough persuasive weight in avoiding tiredness; it aligns well with my proactive nature and trustfulness.
   - **Will consider buying the product (7)**: Despite some reservations about its presentation, I'm willing to give it a chance due to the significant impact on energy levels that I value.

In summary, while not overwhelmingly engaging or aesthetically compelling, this preventative health-focused ad appeals to my helpful, thorough, and trust-based traits. Hence, strong consideration leans towards purchasing based on its functional claims and relevance to maintaining daily productivity.
