**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** 
    - **Like (score=2):** While not strongly positive, I appreciate its message about combating tiredness and dull appearance.
    - **Interesting (score=3):** The ad presents a compelling scenario that many can relate to but doesn't captivate me entirely.  
    - **Good (score=4):** It's effective in communicating the problem it solves, making the drink seem beneficial without being overly dramatic.
    - **Attractive (score=3):** Not extremely visually or emotionally engaging for my tastes, but sufficiently appealing.

- **Purchase intention:** 
    - **Intend to purchase:** Score 5 indicates moderate intent; I acknowledge its potential benefits and see value in trying it out due to the stress-reducing aspect.
    - **Try to buy:** A score of 6 reflects a higher likelihood because addressing fatigue aligns with my need for sustained energy, especially as a civil servant.
    - **Consider buying:** Strongly consider (score=7) since my personality trait of being helpful and original prompts me to explore new solutions for better health and productivity.

Overall, the ad resonates well enough to encourage consideration despite some reservations about its attractiveness. The persuasive message aligns with practical needs and a slight inclination towards trying innovative products without full commitment yet.
