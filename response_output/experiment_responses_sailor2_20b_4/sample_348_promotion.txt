**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **Like (Score: 5)** - As a civil servant who values thoroughness and being well-prepared for work daily, I appreciate its potential to keep me energized. However, it doesn't resonate strongly enough.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The promise of looking "best" seems generic rather than compelling; more details about the product's unique features would be intriguing.
3. **Good (Score: 6)** - It conveys a clear benefit, which aligns with my goal to stay productive and presentable at work. This makes it generally positive but not exceptional.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - The simplicity of the message feels too basic given its potential claims; more visual or emotional appeal would enhance attractiveness.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend (Score: 2)** - While the idea appeals, budget constraints and skepticism about generic promises make me less likely to commit without further proof.
2. **Try (Score: 2)** - Given my tendency toward helpfulness and considering others' well-being, I might be open to a trial purchase if it's reasonably priced or recommended by trusted sources.
3. **Consider (Score: 3)** - The ad does encourage some thought about the product but doesn't sway me significantly without additional evidence of efficacy.

Overall, while appreciative of its message and potential benefits, my cautious nature combined with practical concerns results in moderate interest rather than a strong purchase intent.
