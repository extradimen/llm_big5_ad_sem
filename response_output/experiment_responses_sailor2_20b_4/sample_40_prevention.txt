**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes**: 
  - **Like (score=2)**: I have a mildly negative reaction to the ad. It feels slightly off-putting.
  - **Interesting (score=3)**: The ad is somewhat engaging but not particularly compelling; it's average at best.
  - **Good (score=4)**: While not great, the message appears credible and informative, leaning toward a neutral-to-positive evaluation.
  - **Attractive (score=1)**: I find the advertisement unattractive. It doesn't resonate with my personality or lifestyle preferences.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to Purchase (2)**: No strong inclination; more curious than convinced.
  - **Try Buying (2)**: Slightly open to giving it a try if circumstances align but no firm plan.
  - **Consider Buying (3)**: I'm willing to consider the product, especially given its functional claims about energy and appearance.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad's potential benefits from my practical standpoint as an analytical civil servant who occasionally worries (Strongly Agree), personal style and attitude preferences make me less enthusiastic toward the presentation. Hence, a balanced mix of cautious interest but not immediate intent to purchase.
