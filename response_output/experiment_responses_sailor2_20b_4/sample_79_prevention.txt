**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (2)**: Neutral to mildly negative; the ad seems somewhat generic.
   - **Interesting (3)**: Slightly engaging but not particularly innovative or captivating.
   - **Good (4)**: It's adequately presented, though lacks strong appeal due to its predictability.
   - **Attractive (3)**: The message is clear but does not strongly connect with me emotionally.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (3)**: I don't have a strong intention to buy based on the ad alone, but it's open for consideration.
   - **Try (3)**: There’s curiosity due to its claims, but no immediate drive to try it out right away.
   - **Consider (5)**: The product might be worth considering if other factors align with my lifestyle or needs; not a deal-breaker.

Overall, the ad has moderate influence on me—enough to raise awareness without convincing me completely. My reserved nature and preference for thoroughness would require more information before making a purchase decision.
