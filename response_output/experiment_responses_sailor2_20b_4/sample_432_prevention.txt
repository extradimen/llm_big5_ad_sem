**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - **I like the ad. (Score: 3)** - Neutral-leaning slightly negative; it doesn't particularly resonate with me given my reserved nature.
  - **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 4)** - Somewhat interested due to its straightforward messaging, though not compelling enough for high engagement.
  - **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 2)** - Disagree; it feels somewhat manipulative and doesn't align with my values of being unselfish or original.
  - **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; its focus on avoiding tiredness isn’t personally appealing given my tendency to be emotionally stable.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product. (Score: 2)** - Neutral but slightly hesitant, as I don't prioritize such products regularly.
  - **Will try to buy this product. (Score: 2)** - Similar to above; not inclined but open-minded enough for a potential trial under specific circumstances.
  - **Consider buying the product. (Score: 2)** - Neutral overall; it’s on my radar, but doesn't drive immediate purchase intent.

This balanced evaluation reflects both skepticism towards the ad's messaging and moderate openness to exploring the product based on external needs rather than internal enthusiasm.
