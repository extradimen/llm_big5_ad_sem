**Rationale:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) — Given my reserved nature and focus on practicality, it doesn't immediately evoke strong feelings.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree (3) — The claim seems generic without specific details to capture my interest deeply.
  - **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2) — Lacks credibility; vague promises about energy and appearance don’t resonate with me as a consumer looking for clear benefits.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (3) — Doesn't stand out, feeling more like filler content than something genuinely appealing.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) — The ad doesn’t provide compelling reasons or trustworthiness for me as a single managerial employee with limited income.
  - **Try to buy the product:** Strongly Disagree (1) — No motivation based on my values and cautious approach toward spending.
  - **Consider buying it:** Strongly Disagree (2) — Despite being open-minded, there's no alignment between ad claims and perceived value in my current life circumstances. 

Overall, while I acknowledge the presence of such products, this particular advertisement fails to connect with me personally or justify a potential purchase decision.
