**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 5) - It's somewhat appealing to me due to its promise of energy and looking good.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - I find it moderately engaging but not particularly novel for my demographic.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 3) - Neutral on whether it delivers well; lacks personal relevance.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - Not visually or emotionally compelling enough given my practical mindset.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree, as I prioritize essential needs over luxury items with limited income.
2. **Will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1) - Similarly, not inclined to make an effort for a non-essential item.
3. **Will consider buying the product:** (Score: 2) - Slightly open-minded but minimal consideration due to budget constraints and practical priorities.

Overall, while I appreciate the promise of benefits, my lifestyle, financial situation, and cautious nature lead me towards disinterest in purchasing this drink. The ad resonates marginally at best for someone like myself living with limited resources.
