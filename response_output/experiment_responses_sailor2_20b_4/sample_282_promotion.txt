**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (Score: 4)**  
   While I appreciate its energetic tone and potential benefits, it doesn't resonate strongly with me given my reserved nature.
   
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3.5)**  
   The promise of staying energized appeals but falls short due to my neutral sociability.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2.5)**  
   As a generally careful and methodical person, I find it lacks specific details that would enhance credibility for me personally.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**  
   The presentation may be visually appealing, but without deeper engagement or trust-building elements, its attractiveness is moderate.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1.5)**  
   My strong tendency towards thoroughness and a preference for concrete evidence make me unlikely to immediately commit based on the ad alone.
   
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**  
   Given my cautious nature, I would only consider it after extensive research or personal recommendations.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**  
   There's a slight inclination towards considering it in the future due to its functional claims, but significant external validation is required. 

Overall, while not entirely unfavorable, the ad needs more detailed substantiation and alignment with my cautious consumer profile to drive high purchase intent.
