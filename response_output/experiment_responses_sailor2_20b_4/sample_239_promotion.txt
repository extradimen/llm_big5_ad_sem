**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Ad:**
   - *I like the ad.* (4/7): The claim of energy and looking good resonates somewhat, but not strongly enough given my conservative nature and focus on practicality.
   - *I think it's interesting.* (3/7): Neutral to slightly negative; typical blue-collar lifestyle doesn't prioritize such beverages prominently.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (2/7): Disagreement based on skepticism about quick fixes for energy levels or appearance, considering personal experiences and trust issues.
   - *I find it attractive.* (1/7): Strongly disagree; lacks appeal due to my reserved nature and real-world priorities.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase*: Agree (2/7). While intrigued by the concept, practical considerations and budget limitations keep intent moderate.
   - *Will try it*: Neutral (3/7). There's a slight curiosity but no strong push to act on impulse or habitually buy this product.
   - *Consider buying*: Disagree (4/7). More likely to reconsider after trying under special conditions rather than an ongoing commitment, reflecting cautious spending habits and emotional stability.

Overall, though the ad taps into desirable traits like energy and appearance enhancement, my background, personality, and financial constraints lead me towards a balanced but somewhat skeptical response. The drink might be tried once or in specific situations, but it wouldn't become a regular purchase item for this consumer profile.
