**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad (score: 4)*: Neutrally agree; while I appreciate its message about energy and appearance, it doesn't particularly excite me.
   - *Interesting (score: 3)*: Somewhat agree; the concept is familiar but lacks novelty.
   - *Good (score: 5)*: Agree; it conveys clear benefits relevant to daily routines, making it a reasonable promotion.
   - *Attractive (score: 4)*: Neutrally agree; visually and thematically appealing but not compelling enough.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (score: 2):* Disagree; though the ad is informative, my current financial constraints and other priorities make it unlikely for me to buy now.
   - *Will try to buy this product (score: 3)*: Neutral; there's a slight incline towards trying if I come across the drink at an affordable price or during sales.
   - *Will consider buying this product (score: 3):* Neutral; the ad sparks mild interest, but ultimately, it falls under "nice to have" rather than necessary.

Overall, while I find aspects of the advertisement appealing and well-crafted, my current lifestyle constraints and personal preferences make me hesitant towards immediate purchase. The message resonates moderately without driving strong action or impulse buying.
