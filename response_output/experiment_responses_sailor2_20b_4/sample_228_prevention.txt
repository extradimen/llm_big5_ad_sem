**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad (score = 5):* The ad resonates with my concern about looking and feeling refreshed but does not evoke strong personal excitement.
  - *I think the ad is interesting (score = 6):* It sparks curiosity, particularly for someone who values staying active and appearing energetic.
  - *I believe the ad is good (score = 4):* While I appreciate its messaging, it feels slightly over-the-top in asserting its necessity, reducing my belief level somewhat.
  - *I find the ad attractive (score = 3):* It's decently designed but lacks emotional appeal; hence, attractiveness is moderate.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *I intend to purchase this product (score = 2):* Despite its message alignment with my lifestyle concerns, I'm not compelled enough to actively pursue a purchase.
  - *I will try to buy this product (score = 2):* There's mild interest due to the potential benefits but no strong drive to make an immediate effort.
  - *I will consider buying this product (score = 1):* A low intention score indicates that while I acknowledge its relevance, other factors and alternatives might sway my decision more strongly.

Overall, though positive aspects exist in both attitude towards the ad and consideration of purchasing intent, there's a cautious distance due to perceived over-promise or lack of compelling emotional connection.
