**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad (2/7):**
   - As a reserved individual who prefers simplicity and directness over flashy promotions, this energetic claim might feel superficial.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - Neutral interest; it's neither engaging nor off-putting given my preference for straightforward information.

3. **I believe the ad is good (4/7):**
   - I acknowledge its intentions but lack strong trust in quick fixes or overpromises, so it falls slightly above neutral.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - The appeal isn't compelling due to my reserved nature and generally low confidence in such claims.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (1/7):** 
   - Strongly disagree; I am skeptical about its effectiveness without additional, credible evidence or personal experience.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product (1/7):**
   - Again, strongly against trying it out given my tendency towards practicality and skepticism.

3. **Will consider buying the product (2/7):** 
   - Slightly neutral but leaning negative; while I won't dismiss it outright, I am unlikely to prioritize purchasing due to perceived relevance or trustworthiness. 

Overall, this ad falls short for me in persuasion and credibility, despite recognizing its basic utility claims. My cautious nature and preference for substantiated health choices reduce the likelihood of purchase intention significantly.
