**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (3) – The ad appeals to me but not strongly due to mixed feelings about energy drinks.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) – It captures my attention with the promise of staying energized and looking good, though it doesn't fully excite me.
  - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5) – I appreciate its positive messaging as a responsible consumer product.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – The overall aesthetic or appeal is not particularly compelling to my taste.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my reserved nature and nervous disposition, the ad doesn’t motivate me enough to buy.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree (1) – No immediate desire or urgency to try this product despite its benefits.
  - **Will Consider Buying:** Disagree (2) – While not ruling it out entirely, I am unlikely to prioritize this purchase over other needs due to my cautious and worried nature.

Overall, while the ad is good in messaging and somewhat interesting, personal traits like being reserved, nervousness, and lack of immediate need contribute to a low likelihood of making a purchase.
