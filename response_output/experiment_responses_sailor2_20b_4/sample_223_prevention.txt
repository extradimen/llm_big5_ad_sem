**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Disagree (2) — The talkative trait doesn't resonate with me, making personal connection via ads less appealing.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral (3) — It has a standard message but lacks novelty for someone who tends to be emotionally stable and careful about claims.
   - **Good:** Agree (4) — While not exceptional, the straightforward messaging is clear; however, it could use more compelling evidence or emotional hooks.
   - **Attractive:** Strongly Agree (7) — The prevention angle ("may feel tired & look dull") taps into common anxieties and self-care concerns.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** 6 — Though the ad is attractive, I may still be hesitant due to my cautious nature.
   - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Agree (7) — Given its persuasive framing around well-being, I'm inclined to at least give it a try.
   - **Consider Buying:** 6 — The appeal of preventing fatigue and dullness aligns with my interest in maintaining daily productivity; hence, serious consideration but not immediate purchase commitment.

Overall, the ad effectively addresses common needs for alertness and appearance, which are relevant yet manageable within my lifestyle. My strong agreement to "attractive" suggests a positive influence on perception, leading towards potential trial and eventual consideration of purchasing.
