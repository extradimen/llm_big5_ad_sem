**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: Moderate (4)
   - While I appreciate energizing and appearance-enhancing promises, my strong tendency to be talkative and outgoing may make me generally receptive; however, it lacks a compelling hook for someone who often worries.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Slightly Positive (3)
   - The promise of staying energized appeals but seems common in todayâ€™s market, making it less intriguing compared to unique features or experiences.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral (2)
   - The claims are generic and not backed by specific details about ingredients, benefits, or user testimonials, reducing my trust level given my tendency towards caution.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Minimal Appeal (2)
   - Without strong visual appeal, emotional resonance, or personal connection to fitness routines or beauty concerns, its attractiveness is limited.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Despite being talkative and social, my worries about effectiveness (due to vague claims) and carelessness in decision-making prevent a strong intent.
2. **Will try to buy this product**: Strongly Disagree (1)
   - Given the lack of convincing details or personal urgency related to energy or appearance, there's no motivation for an initial purchase attempt.
3. **Consider buying this product**: Mild Consideration (1)
   - The moderate appeal slightly nudges me towards considering it, but only under specific circumstances (e.g., discount offers) and after further research.

Overall, while the ad elicits some interest, its generic nature and lack of detail do not convert my casual inclination into a solid intention to buy. I am highly critical due to skepticism about effectiveness and clarity regarding benefits.
