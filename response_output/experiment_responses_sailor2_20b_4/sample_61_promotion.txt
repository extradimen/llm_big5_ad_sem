**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (score = 3)
   - Given my reserved nature and occasional tendency to worry, I find the promise of staying energized appealing but not overwhelmingly engaging.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (score = 4)
   - The concept resonates with someone who values energy levels and appearance, making it somewhat intriguing.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral to Slightly Positive (score = 3)
   - While not dismissive, I don't see strong evidence of its effectiveness without more specifics about ingredients or benefits.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly Agree (score = 5)
   - The visual and messaging hint at a lifestyle improvement that could be attractive for someone balancing school, family commitments, and personal goals.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral with Tendency toward No (score = 2)
   - My practical nature leans more towards cautious skepticism about the claims; I'm not convinced by a simple ad alone.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Lean Towards Consideration (score = 3)
   - It's moderately appealing, but further research or user reviews would likely be required before making a purchase decision.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Neutral with Slight Interest (score = 2)
   - The ad raises curiosity without compelling me to act immediately; I might add it to my "to-consider" list based on future exploration and evidence of effectiveness.

Overall, the advertisement has a mild positive impression but lacks sufficient detail or personal connection for strong intent. Additional information would be necessary before committing financially as a student with limited income (less than 15 million VND/month).
