**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (7-point Scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** Neutral leaning towards a mild positive (score of 3). Given my reserved nature, it doesn't excite me but presents an okay vibe.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly above neutral (4) due to its relevance in addressing fatigue and appearance issues which are familiar concerns for many blue-collar workers.
   - **Good:** Fairly good impression (5), as the ad effectively communicates a clear problem-solution message, though it doesn't evoke strong emotions or trust from my perspective.
   - **Attractive:** Moderate attraction level (2). While not compelling due to its straightforward nature and potentially generic claims, I acknowledge its practicality.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Moderately inclined but cautious at a 3. Given my tendency towards thoroughness in job performance, health-related products may be considered for sustained energy.
   - **Will try to buy:** Similar inclination (3), driven by the desire to mitigate perceived physical issues without full commitment yet.
   - **Consider buying:** Slightly higher interest level at 4; it's a product I'd keep in mind but won't rush into purchasing, considering price and potential effectiveness.

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately with its preventive message for fatigue and appearance, my reserved nature, slight distrust, and cautious decision-making lead to modest scores without immediate strong intent.
