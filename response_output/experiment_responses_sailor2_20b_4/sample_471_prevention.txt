**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - **Like**: Strongly Disagree (2) – Given my reserved nature and tendency to be critical of health claims.
   - **Interesting**: Disagree (3) – The message is somewhat generic without specific details that would pique my interest.
   - **Good**: Neutral (4) – It doesn't stand out positively, but isn’t overly negative either.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (3) – The fear-mongering approach feels manipulative rather than attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Neutral (5) – While I'm not against trying new products, the ad doesn't strongly compel me due to its overly dramatic tone.
   - **Will Try to Buy**: Neutral (5) – There's some curiosity but no strong drive; cautious approach is warranted.
   - **Will Consider Buying**: Agree (6) – Though skeptical of immediate intent, I might consider giving it a try if there are additional credible reviews or evidence supporting the claims.

Overall, while not entirely negative, my reserved and critical nature leads to moderate interest with significant caution. The ad lacks personal appeal but doesn’t dismiss me outright, thus leading to a somewhat balanced consideration for potential purchase.
