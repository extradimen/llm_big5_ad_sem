**Evaluation:** 

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3/7)**: As a reserved and emotionally stable person, I find it neutral rather than overwhelmingly positive.
   - **Interesting (4/7)**: It intrigues me because addressing fatigue is relevant to my lifestyle as a blue-collar worker; however, its appeal isn't strong enough for high enthusiasm.
   - **Good (5/7)**: The message seems reasonable since energy and appearance are important. Despite being neutral in self-help behaviors, I acknowledge the product's potential benefits.
   - **Attractive (2/7)**: While not visually unappealing, my careful nature makes me skeptical of quick fixes, making it less attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral but slightly inclined given its relevance; Iâ€™m open-minded about trying if the price and quality are reasonable.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Agree, because experiencing a noticeable change might motivate me more than a single purchase intention.
   - **Consider Buying:** Slightly agree since it aligns with wanting to improve energy levels without fully committing based on an ad alone. 

Overall, the ad has moderate appeal but must provide reassurance through trustworthiness and tangible benefits to convert my consideration into action.
