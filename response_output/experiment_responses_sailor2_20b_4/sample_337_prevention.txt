**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - While I appreciate its straightforward messaging about preventing fatigue and dullness, my reserved nature means it doesn't immediately spark excitement.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - The message is clear but lacks innovative or engaging elements that would captivate me as someone with a strong imagination and originality preference.

3. **I believe the ad is good (4/7):**
   - It effectively communicates its benefits, which aligns well with my practical mindset despite being slightly uninspired in execution.

4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):**
   - The simplicity may be seen as unappealing to someone who values creativity and uniqueness highly; hence, it falls short on attractiveness for me.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (5/7):**
   - Given my job's physically demanding nature, the promise of increased energy resonates moderately, making me inclined towards trying it out.

2. **I will try to buy this product (6/7):**
   - My generally trusting and helpful tendencies mean I might give it a chance due to its potential benefits, even if not fully persuaded by the ad itself.

3. **I will consider buying this product (7/7):**
   - With occasional worries about energy levels, the idea of alleviating fatigue holds strong appeal, leading me to seriously consider purchasing despite some reservations regarding the advertisement's presentation. 

Overall, while the advertising content isn't perfectly aligned with my high creative expectations and outgoing nature, its practical benefits align well enough with my needs as a blue-collar worker, encouraging consideration for potential purchase.
