**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate the intended message of energy boost and looking good, my reserved nature makes it less appealing to me personally.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - The concept seems engaging, but it doesn't grab me with excitement due to its typical "self-improvement" theme.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5)** - It's professionally done and effectively conveys benefits; however, it feels somewhat generic compared to my expectations.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2)** - The overall attractiveness is limited because it doesn't align strongly with my reserved nature or daily priorities.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Given my focus on practicality and budget constraints, I'm unlikely to prioritize a "look good" drink over essential needs.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - There is mild curiosity, but the moderate income means it's not in immediate consideration for non-essential items.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - While I'm open-minded and make plans, current priorities skew towards more utilitarian purchases, so "considering" aligns best with my cautious approach to spending.

In summary, the ad is competent but not compelling enough for a strong purchase intent from someone like me. The balance of being reserved yet practical influences both appreciation levels and willingness to buy.
