**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3)  
     Although the concept seems practical for energy and appearance, my reserved nature makes it hard to fully appreciate this type of advertisement.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4)  
     The message about fatigue and looking dull resonates with common experiences but doesn’t captivate me strongly due to a neutral outlook on social messaging.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5)  
     It presents a clear benefit, making it somewhat convincing for its target audience despite my personal tendencies toward critical thinking.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2)   
     The visual appeal and catchy wording are okay but don’t align closely with my reserved preference.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3)  
     While I acknowledge its potential value, personal budget constraints and skepticism about immediate need mean intent is moderate.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3)   
     If available at a reasonable price point or with significant offers, I might give it a trial run based on my generally trusting but cautious nature.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 2)  
     The decision leans towards “consideration” rather than immediate action due to balanced practicality and emotional detachment.

Overall, the ad is reasonably effective in conveying its message of preventing fatigue and dullness. However, my reserved personality and preference for a well-thought-out purchase mean moderate intention with room for external factors (price, convenience) to influence actual buying behavior.
