   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5): The ad effectively communicates its benefits, which are important to many peopleâ€™s daily lives.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2): My sociable nature sometimes makes me wary of overt or overly flashy advertisements; this one feels slightly less appealing.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral (3): The benefits align with my needs, but there are other factors like price and personal preference that would need consideration.
   - **Try:** Agree (4): I am open to giving the product a try if it fits into my budget and lifestyle.
