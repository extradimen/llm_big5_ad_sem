**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like (score 3)**: The ad is neutral but not particularly engaging for me.
  - **Interesting (score 4)**: I find it somewhat interesting as it addresses common daily concerns like tiredness and appearance, which are relevant to my lifestyle.
  - **Good (score 2)**: It meets basic expectations of a product claim, though doesn’t feel exceptionally well-executed or compelling.
  - **Attractive (score 1)**: The ad lacks visual appeal and emotional resonance for me; I don't find it particularly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to purchase**: While the concerns are valid, my budget constraints and other competing priorities mean a strong intent is low—hence, score of 2.
  - **Will try (score 2)**: Given its relevance, I might be open to giving it a try if cost isn’t prohibitive but not strongly inclined.
  - **Consider buying**: There's an element of consideration due to potential benefits in combating tiredness and looking dull; hence, score of 3.

In summary, the ad is moderately interesting and relevant, but its appeal falls short for me emotionally. Although I might consider purchasing or trying it under specific circumstances (e.g., if offered at a fair price), my strong financial constraints impact immediate purchase intent significantly.
