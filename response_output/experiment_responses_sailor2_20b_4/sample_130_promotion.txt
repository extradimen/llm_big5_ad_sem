**Evaluation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 6)**  
   Given my talkative and outgoing nature, I appreciate ads that are engaging and energetic. The promise of staying energized appeals to me; hence, I find it likable but not overwhelmingly so.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)**  
   While not groundbreaking, the concept resonates with someone who values daily energy and appearance, making it moderately interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4.5)**  
   On a neutral to slightly agree side, I find its messaging clear but could be more compelling or differentiated in my saturated market environment.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4)**  
   The overall presentation lacks strong appeal for me; it's functional rather than visually striking.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3)**  
   Though interested, I'm not compelled enough by a single promotional message without further exploration of ingredients or benefits.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2.5)**  
   The lackluster attractiveness and moderate interest make me hesitant; more reviews or personal recommendations would sway my decision higher.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**  
   I remain open-minded but need additional information, such as price points within my budget (<15 million VND) and user testimonials to seriously consider it for purchase.

In summary, the ad aligns somewhat with my active lifestyle preferences yet falls short on emotional engagement and detailed appeal. Further convincing steps would be necessary for a firm decision towards purchasing.
