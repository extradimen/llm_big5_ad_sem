**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - While not strongly liking it, I find aspects of the advertisement appealing given its focus on energy and appearance, which are relevant to my daily routines.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):**
   - The concept is engaging but lacks depth or novelty that would make me highly interested. It's straightforward but not particularly captivating.

3. **I believe the ad is good (4/7):**
   - The message appears well-constructed, highlighting benefits that many might find valuable. However, it doesn't evoke strong belief due to personal preferences for detailed information and credibility.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** 
   - Personally reserved, I don’t find the visuals or tone particularly appealing despite its attempts at energy infusion.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (5/7):**
   - Although not a strong intention, it’s on my radar due to needing an energizing drink and liking how such products can boost daily performance.
   
2. **Will try to buy the product (6/7):**
   - I’m inclined to give it a try since trying new energy-boosters aligns with being open-minded and appreciating practical benefits.

3. **Will consider buying this product (7/7):**
   - Given my neutral helpfulness, trust in brands, and thorough approach to tasks, the potential for staying energized is highly considered. I'm likely to evaluate reviews and possibly purchase it if consistent with my needs.

Overall, while not entirely enamored by the ad's style or presentation, its core message resonates enough to make me seriously consider purchasing this product due to practicality and alignment with personal goals.
