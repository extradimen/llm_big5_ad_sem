**Evaluation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
- **I like the ad:** (Score = 3)
  - Given my generally reserved nature and lack of emotional stability, I find it mildly appealing but not particularly compelling.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2)
  - The promise of energy and looking good sounds fine, but there's little engagement for me as a more introverted individual.

- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4)
  - It conveys clear benefits; however, its overall appeal feels somewhat surface-level without deeper connection to my values or lifestyle.
  
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3)
  - The visual and messaging design might attract a younger demographic better suited for these claims. For me, it falls in the middle of appealing.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2)
  - While not disagreeing outright, I'm skeptical about immediate investment due to budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and limited perceived need.
  
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)
  - Low intent here because daily expenses prioritize essentials over extras, especially since there are other cost-effective ways to stay energized.

- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1)
  - I'm open to considering it in future if my circumstances change or a compelling offer arises, but currently, the ad does not drive immediate action for me.  

Overall, while mildly favorable towards the advertisement content-wise, practical concerns and personal preferences lead to low purchase intentions at this time.
