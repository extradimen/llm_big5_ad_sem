**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like (Score: 5):** Neutral to positive; I don't dislike it but find it somewhat appealing.
   - **Interesting (Score: 6):** It peaks curiosity due to its straightforward message, particularly relevant to my daily fatigue experiences.
   - **Good (Score: 4.5):** Slightly below average; the ad seems credible with a clear benefit promise, though not overwhelmingly persuasive.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3):** The visual and emotional appeal could be stronger for it to truly stand out.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
   - **Intend (Score: 2):** I'm not strongly committed; the ad piques interest but doesn't drive a strong purchase decision.
   - **Try (Score: 1.5):** Slightly below neutral due to mixed feelings about trying something new, especially with current budget constraints.
   - **Consider (Score: 3):** It's on my radar for future consideration if other factors align and I need an energy boost.

Overall, the ad is effective in raising awareness of potential fatigue but does not strongly compel me as a blue-collar worker due to pricing sensitivity and moderate appeal. The product might be considered later based on personal needs and budget availability.
