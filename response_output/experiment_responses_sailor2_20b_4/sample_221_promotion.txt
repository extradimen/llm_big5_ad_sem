**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3): While not strongly positive, it is appealing enough given my values and preferences.
   - **Interesting:** Agree (4): The concept of staying energized and looking good resonates with practical needs.
   - **Good:** Strongly Agree (5): As someone valuing helpfulness and new ideas, the promise aligns well.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2): Despite being drawn to its benefits, my reserved nature makes me less inclined towards overt attractiveness in ads.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral (3): The advertisement sparks consideration but doesn't immediately compel a purchase due to mixed feelings.
   - **Try/Consider:** Agree (4) and Strongly Agree (5): I see potential benefits and am open-minded enough to give it a try, reflecting my tendency towards new ideas and trying out products that meet daily needs.

Overall, the ad resonates moderately well with me personally; it prompts interest but does not evoke immediate strong purchase intent. The balance between practicality and novelty aligns with my personality traits and preferences.
