**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like**: I would rate this as a moderate agreement (score of 4). While not strongly engaging, it aligns with my preference for straightforward messaging.
2. **Interesting**: The ad seems interesting enough to catch attention but doesn't wow me (score of 5).
3. **Good**: It appears credible and well-crafted, though slightly generic; thus, a moderate agreement score (6) is appropriate.
4. **Attractive**: Personally, I am drawn more towards practical benefits rather than looks alone, so itâ€™s moderately attractive to me (score of 3).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Given my neutral stance on the ad and a preference for results over appearance, direct intent is low (score of 2).
2. **Try to buy this product**: I might consider giving it a try based on its energizing claims but am not highly compelled (score of 2.5).
3. **Consider buying this product**: The balanced benefits are enough to keep the option open in future purchasing decisions (score of 3).

Overall, while the ad resonates moderately well with my personality traits and values, it does not trigger a strong purchase impulse due to my practical focus as an office worker. Still, there's room for cautious consideration based on its claims.
