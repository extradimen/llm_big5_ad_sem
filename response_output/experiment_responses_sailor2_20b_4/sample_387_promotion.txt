**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral to slightly agree (score of 3). The energy-boosting and appearance benefits resonate with my values as a civil servant seeking productivity but not enough for strong enthusiasm.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (score of 4). It taps into universal desiresâ€”staying energized and looking good, which are appealing.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral leaning towards agree (score of 5). The message is straightforward but lacks emotional depth or novelty that would strongly sway me.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Slightly disagree (score of 2). While visually presentable, it feels generic and less unique in a crowded market for energy drinks.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral leaning towards positive but not strong intent (score of 3). The claim is compelling, yet other factors like brand loyalty or existing habits could influence my decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Slightly negative outlook (score of 2). Given the numerous options and personal cautiousness, trying it would be secondary over known alternatives.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Agree (score of 4). There's enough merit in staying energized that makes me open to considering a purchase if I need variety or see compelling deals/promotions.

Overall, while positive elements like energy and appearance are valuable traits for my demographic profile, the ad doesn't fully engage me with its straightforward nature. Therefore, it garners moderate interest without driving an immediate purchasing decision.
