**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

### **Attitudinal Responses:**
1. **I like the ad (Score = 4):**
   - As a sociable but slightly reserved individual who values trust and emotional balance, I appreciate ads that focus on positive benefits such as staying energized and looking good. However, it feels somewhat superficial given my practical mindset.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 3):**
   - While the concept resonates with a desire to enhance daily life, my "neutral" talkativeness means I don't find it overly captivating or engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 3.5):**
   - The message aligns with general wellness but lacks detailed credibility or specific appeal for me personally; hence, a slightly positive score.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2.5):**
   - Given my reserved nature and preference not to emphasize outward appearance heavily, I don't find it particularly appealing on an emotional level.

### **Purchase Intention:**

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):** 
   - Despite the benefits highlighted, my income constraints ($16m-25m VND/month) and more conservative spending habits mean a strong intent is low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 1.5):**
   - Even if intrigued, I'm unlikely to actively seek out or prioritize such purchases due to financial priorities.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 1.75):**
   - There is a minimal consideration as it aligns with self-improvement goals but not enough drive given my current circumstances and other life commitments.

Overall, while acknowledging the potential value, practical considerations—financial constraints and personal priorities—significantly influence both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention. Hence, moderate to low scores across the board.
