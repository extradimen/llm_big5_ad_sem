**Evaluation:**

* **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
    - **I like the ad (score=3):** The promise of staying energized resonates somewhat, but it feels slightly generic.
    - **Interesting (score=4):** It has a catchy concept, though not exceptionally novel given common energy drink marketing.
    - **Good (score=5):** Neutral-to-positive as it aligns with self-care goals, but lacks strong appeal due to the crowded market.
    - **Attractive (score=2):** The design or visual elements might be underwhelming, making it less attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  
    - **Intend to purchase this product (score=1):** I am not convinced enough based on my current needs and budget constraints.
    - **Will try to buy this product (score=2):** If offered at a promotional price or by friends, curiosity might drive me to give it a shot once.
    - **Consider buying the product (score=3):** It's in the back of my mind; if circumstances align better with future needs or financial status, I'll reconsider.

Overall, while there are some positives and potential appeal due to its claimed benefits, personal traits like being reserved, not overly trusting marketing claims, and limited funds make me cautious about committing strongly without further incentive.
