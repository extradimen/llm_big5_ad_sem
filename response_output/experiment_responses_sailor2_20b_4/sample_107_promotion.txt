**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad (Score: 6):**
   - Strongly Agree on being talkative and sociable makes me generally inclined to appreciate energetic and motivational content.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5):**
   - The promise of staying energized resonates, especially for a young civil servant balancing duties; however, it's not extraordinarily unique.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4.5):**
   - While I appreciate its message, there’s room for skepticism about effectiveness and authenticity without deeper details on how the drink works.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3.5):**
   - It appeals to my desire to look good but falls short in emotional connection or creativity compared to other media content.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):** 
   - Neutral on being unselfish, combined with some skepticism about its claims makes me hesitant to commit without further evidence.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1.5):**
   - Given my monthly income and budget constraints, there’s a low likelihood of trying it unless offered at an attractive price or bundled deal.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1):** 
   - While the idea is appealing, I am more inclined to explore other options that might better suit both my lifestyle and economic situation.
   
Overall, while the ad sparks some interest due to its energetic appeal and strong social traits in me, actual purchase intent remains low because of concerns about effectiveness, price, and personal needs.
