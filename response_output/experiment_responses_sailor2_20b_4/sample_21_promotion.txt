**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (3):** Neutral because it's catchy but doesn't strongly appeal.
   - **Interesting (2):** Disagree slightly; the claims seem generic and not particularly intriguing for my needs.
   - **Good (3):** Neutral; while energizing sounds good, the promises feel over-generalized without specifics or credible evidence.
   - **Attractive (4):** Slightly Agree; visually appealing design might draw some attention initially.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (1):** Strongly Disagree; no strong motivation from ad alone.
   - **Will Try to Buy (2):** Neutral leaning towards Disagreement; may consider if available at a good price or recommended by trusted sources.
   - **Consider Buying (2):** Agree but with reservations; the product might be worth considering under better circumstances, not just based on this advertisement. 

The ad is mildly engaging visually and verbally, but my cautious nature combined with concerns about authenticity make it unlikely I'd immediately purchase due to its promotional stance alone.
