**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (5) - While I find it somewhat engaging, its universal appeal doesn't strongly resonate with me.
2. **Interesting:** Agree (6) - The idea of staying energized and looking good is generally interesting, especially for someone my age who values productivity.
3. **Good Ad:** Slightly Agree (4) - It conveys a clear message but feels somewhat generic; it lacks specific details or compelling storytelling that would make me strongly believe in its effectiveness.
4. **Attractive:** Disagree (3) - The ad seems too focused on superficial outcomes, which isn't high priority for someone who values authenticity and practical benefits more.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Low Intent)
   - Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and moderate interest in the ad, I am not strongly inclined to buy it.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:** 3 (Somewhat Likely)
   - There is a slight curiosity due to its promise of energy boost, but hesitation remains regarding cost and necessity.

3. **Consider buying this product:** 4 (Mildly Considered)
   - I acknowledge that the drink might be beneficial under certain circumstances, like stressful days or special occasions, but it doesn't top my immediate purchase list.

Overall, though somewhat appreciative of its messaging, the ad does not drive a strong enough desire for me to make an impulse buy. Practicality and budget considerations outweigh any mild attraction.
