2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3) - Generally find it engaging, but not overly captivating given my personality traits.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 2) - Somewhat skeptical; does not fully align with my preferences or strong beliefs about marketing claims.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 5) - Moderately appealing visually, but lacks emotional depth to strongly draw me in.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) - Not a firm intention due to my generally critical nature and lack of strong personal connection.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1) - Minimal likelihood; despite the ad, I'm not motivated enough given current needs or trust issues with marketing promises.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2) - Slightly open to considering it under certain circumstances (e.g., a better offer), but won't actively seek it out.

The scores reflect a moderate engagement without strong commitment to buying action.
