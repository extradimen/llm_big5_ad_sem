**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad:** 5
   - While I appreciate its focus on energy and appearance enhancement (which aligns with general wellness), my reserved nature means it doesn't elicit strong emotional appeal.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 4
   - The message is clear but not particularly captivating for someone who isn’t immediately drawn to flashy promotions.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 6
   - It's well-crafted and straightforward, leveraging common goals like staying energized and looking great—appealing values in daily life. However, it could be more compelling with additional details or proof points (e.g., scientific claims).

4. **I find the ad attractive:** 3 
   - The appeal is somewhat neutral; while visually engaging, my preference for authenticity over hype slightly diminishes its attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 4
   - There’s a moderate inclination due to practical benefits, but not enough urgency or personal relevance just from the ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** 3 
   - I'm open to considering it if other factors (e.g., reviews, price) align with my criteria and budget.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 2
   - The initial impression is positive but not compelling enough for an immediate purchase decision; further information or experiences are required.

Overall, the advertisement resonates on a functional level, aligning well with health-conscious values typical in Southeast Asian cultures. However, it needs more robust support to transform interest into strong intent and action. Personal credibility (e.g., celebrity endorsements) or deeper insights could enhance its persuasiveness for someone like me.
