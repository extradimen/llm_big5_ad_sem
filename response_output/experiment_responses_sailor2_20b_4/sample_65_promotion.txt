**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 3)**: While I appreciate energy and wellness products, this ad doesn't resonate strongly enough due to my reserved nature.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)**: It presents a straightforward message that's engaging, but not particularly innovative or compelling given its simplicity.
3. **Good (Score: 5)**: The promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with common needs; however, it lacks depth to strongly impress me.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)**: Though helpful for energy levels, the visuals or emotional appeal don't capture my attention effectively.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: Moderate interest due to practical benefits but not strong enough motivation alone (3).
2. **Try to buy**: Would consider giving it a try if available in local stores and within budget constraints (3).
3. **Consider buying**: Given its promise, I am open-minded; however, other factors like brand trust will also influence my decision (3).

Overall, while the ad holds some appeal, my reserved nature and cautious approach to purchases mean higher commitment levels aren't guaranteed without additional supporting evidence or personal experience with similar products.
