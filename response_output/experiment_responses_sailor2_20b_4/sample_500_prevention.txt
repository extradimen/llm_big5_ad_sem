**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale)**:
   - **Like**: I find it neutral to slightly positive but not strongly engaging (`4`).
   - **Interesting**: The message is clear about fatigue and dullness prevention, which might intrigue me (`5`).
   - **Good**: It effectively highlights a common issue without being overly dramatic; hence, acceptable quality (`6`).
   - **Attractive**: While the concept appeals to my need for energy, it doesn't feel exceptionally appealing or eye-catching (`3`). 

2. **Purchase Intention (7-point scale)**:
   - **Intend to Purchase**: The ad's message aligns with self-care goals but lacks strong persuasion for immediate action (`2`).
   - **Try to Buy**: There is consideration given, especially if the product reviews or brand reputation are favorable (`2`).
   - **Consider Buying**: It remains on my radar due to its relevance and potential benefits (though not high urgency) (`3`). 

In summary:
- The ad strikes a balance between being informative and somewhat engaging but falls short in emotional pull.
- My personality traits, such as helpfulness, sociability, and a slight worry tendency influence some level of consideration without strong intent to buy immediately. Factors like brand trust and product features would play crucial roles before making an actual purchase decision.
