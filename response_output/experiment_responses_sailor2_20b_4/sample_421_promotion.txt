**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (3)**: While the message about staying energized and looking your best resonates on some level, it feels somewhat generic for my needs as a blue-collar worker focused more on practicality.
  - **Interesting (4)**: The ad is moderately engaging because energy drinks are relevant in busy lifestyles, but not groundbreaking.
  - **Good (5)**: I appreciate the positive messaging around daily well-being; however, it lacks specific appeal to me.
  - **Attractive (2)**: Personally, I find ads focused solely on appearance and energy less attractive compared to functional benefits.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (1)**: Given my current budget constraints (monthly income range) and the emphasis on looks over direct utility, I am unlikely to prioritize this purchase.
  - **Try (3)**: There might be a mild curiosity if recommended by someone trusted or during specific low-energy days at work.
  - **Consider (4)**: With an open mind toward health-conscious options, itâ€™s worth considering under suitable circumstances but not a strong priority.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates valuable benefits yet doesn't strongly align with my practical needs and budgetary constraints. Hence, it earns moderate scores overall without driving immediate purchase intent.
