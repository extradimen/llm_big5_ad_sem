**Evaluation and Justification:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 5*
   - While I appreciate its straightforward message targeting fatigue, it feels a bit manipulative for someone my age who often values honesty.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 4*
   - It catches attention with promises of energy and vitality but isn't particularly innovative or engaging given my preference for novelty.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 3.5*
   - The message itself could be effective, but the overall execution lacks creativity that resonates strongly with someone who values originality.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 2.5*
   - It doesn't visually or emotionally attract me as much; it feels more like a generic health drink commercial rather than something exciting for younger demographics.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - My generally strong agreeable nature is countered by skepticism about exaggerated claims, making me unlikely to commit fully.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 1.5*
   - Slight curiosity might prompt a trial purchase if the price point matches my monthly income range, but not with high enthusiasm.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 2 (Neutral)*
   - It's on the radar for consideration, especially during times of physical fatigue. However, other factors like reviews and personal health needs would heavily influence a final decision.

In summary, while I acknowledge the ad’s potential effectiveness in targeting specific concerns, my personality traits—especially those leaning towards originality, social interaction, and some skepticism—result in moderate to low interest both in the advertisement itself and purchasing intent. A more engaging or innovative approach might sway me further.
