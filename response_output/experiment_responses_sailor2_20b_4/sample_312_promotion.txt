**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (4). The advertisement doesn't significantly attract or repel me personally, given my reserved and unselfish nature. It feels somewhat neutral but not compelling enough to elicit strong liking.
  - **Interesting:** Disagree (3). For someone who tends towards careful planning and sometimes being careless, the benefits promised don't seem particularly captivating; thus, it lacks interest.
  - **Good:** Strongly Disagree (2). My generally skeptical nature makes me question whether this simplistic claim accurately reflects real improvements in energy or appearance, leading to disbelief in its effectiveness.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (3). While not repulsive, the ad's messaging doesn't align strongly with my values and daily priorities, making it less attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend:** Strongly Disagree (1). Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and a preference for practicality over appearance-driven products, there's no strong inclination to buy.
  - **Try:** Strongly Disagree (2). The lack of trust in the adâ€™s claims and limited budget combine to make trying the product an unlikely choice.
  - **Consider:** Neutral (4). Despite skepticism, I wouldn't completely rule out considering it under special circumstances or if more substantial evidence is presented that aligns with my values.

Overall, while open-mindedness allows for consideration, both the ad's appeal and its conversion into a purchase intention are significantly low due to my reserved nature, financial situation, and critical evaluation of promotional claims.
