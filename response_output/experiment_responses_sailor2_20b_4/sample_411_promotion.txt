**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad (score: 4)*:
     Despite being talkative and outgoing, I find it somewhat engaging but not overwhelmingly so.
   
   - *I think the ad is interesting (score: 5)*:
     The promise of staying energized resonates due to my active lifestyle as a postgraduate student, making me moderately interested.

   - *I believe the ad is good (score: 6)*:
     It appeals on a practical level with its benefits for daily appearance and energy; I see value in it but not without reservations about trustworthiness.
   
   - *I find the ad attractive (score: 3)*:
     The visual presentation might be average, lacking strong emotional appeal given my tendency to worry and lack of emotional stability.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *I intend to purchase this product (score: 2)*:
     While I see its potential benefits, there's hesitation due to financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) and the adâ€™s credibility issues.
   
   - *I will try to buy this product (score: 4)*:
     Curiosity and a sense of helpfulness might lead me to give it a trial run, balancing potential benefits against cost concerns.

   - *I will consider buying this product (score: 4)*:
     It's definitely on my radar due to its practicality, but I'll weigh options carefully before making an actual purchase decision. 

Overall, the ad aligns with some of my values and preferences, particularly regarding energy and appearance benefits; however, it doesn't fully captivate me given trust concerns and financial limitations. Thus, a cautious yet open-to-try attitude emerges.
