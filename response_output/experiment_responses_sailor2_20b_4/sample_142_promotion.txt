**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
    - **I like the ad:** Neutral (3): The energy and appearance aspects are attractive but not enough to spark strong personal enthusiasm.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (4): It's engaging as it addresses wellness needs relevant in everyday life, making me consider its points.
    - **Good:** Somewhat Agree (5): While the concept is solid, it lacks specific details that could make it more compelling or believable for me.
    - **Attractive:** Disagree (2): The overall presentation may not hit my personal style preferences, and the claims feel a bit too generic.

- **Purchase Intention**
    - **Intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1): Despite liking aspects of it, there is no immediate impetus or urgency for me to buy now.
    - **Try to buy this product:** Neutral/Considered Try (3): Open to trying if I see genuine results from others who share similar concerns about energy and appearance.
    - **Will consider buying the product:** Considerable (3): It's on my radar, but additional information or a personal connection might be necessary before making a purchase decision. 

Overall, while the ad holds some appeal due to its target benefits, it falls short in compelling me without more concrete evidence or customization for individual needs. Thus, the moderate scores reflect cautious consideration rather than strong conviction.
