**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - *Like:* 2 (Disagree) — Despite being a civil servant with a reserved and cautious nature, I don’t feel personally drawn to the ad.
   - *Interesting:* 3 (Neutral) — The concept of staying energized is somewhat engaging but doesn't grab my attention strongly.
   - *Good:* 4 (Agree) — Presentation seems solid; it appears credible in its promises, aligning with a thorough and trustworthy approach. 
   - *Attractive:* 3 (Neutral) — While not unappealing, the ad lacks emotional resonance or excitement for me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - *Intend to Purchase:* 5 (Strongly Agree to Consider) — The benefits of staying energized align with my need for sustained productivity as a civil servant.
   - *Try to Buy:* 6 (Strongly Agree) — I'm inclined to give it a try, balancing practicality and potential improvement in daily performance.
   - *Consider Buying:* 7 (Strongly Agree) — This product is on my radar; the promise of looking good along with energy boosts makes me seriously consider purchasing.

In summary, while the advertisement doesn't evoke strong personal enthusiasm due to its reserved nature, it has a clear appeal for practical benefits and professional efficiency. As someone who values thoroughness and planning (strong agreement), I am highly likely to at least try and potentially regularly buy this product despite some reservations in terms of overall attractiveness.
