**Evaluation and Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**  
   - **Like (2/7):** As someone who is reserved (Strongly Agree), I am not immediately drawn to talkative or overly energetic ads, so my initial liking is moderate.
   - **Interesting (3/7):** The message about fatigue and dull appearance could resonate with daily struggles in a blue-collar job. It peaks mild interest but does not excite me strongly.
   - **Good (4/7):** While I value practical information, the ad seems credible enough to convey real concerns without being manipulative; hence, it gets a moderate positive score.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** The advertisement might lack visual appeal or strong emotional connection for my reserved nature, leading me to find it only mildly attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Considering the utility of staying alert and looking fresh during work hours is important, I give a score of 3 (neutral leaning towards agreement). It aligns with practical needs but doesn't drive immediate impulse.
   - **Try or Buy Next Time:** There’s a reasonable willingness to test if others share my experience (score: 4), especially from the perspective of improving daily life quality without significant commitment risk.
   - **Consider Buying:** Given my reserved nature and careful approach, I'll definitely consider it when needed but won't be rushed into an immediate purchase (score: 5).

Overall, while the ad makes a valid point and earns some credibility with its straightforward message, it doesn’t strongly persuade me due to personal preferences towards moderation and practicality rather than high-energy marketing. Hence, moderate intent scores reflect my considered evaluation.
