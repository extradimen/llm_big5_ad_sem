**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - Given my reserved and somewhat cynical nature, I find promotional claims about instant energy and improved appearance unconvincing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
   - It doesn't excite me much; the promises seem common in this market.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4 (Disagree) *
   - The lack of specifics about how it delivers these benefits and my natural skepticism make it hard for me to trust.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)*
   - Visually, it might be well-crafted, but emotionally and intellectually, I'm not drawn in.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)*
   - The ad's superficial appeal doesn't align with my cautious buying habits or my current needs.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)* 
   - While I might be curious, the low trust and high expectations for efficacy prevent a strong urge to purchase.

3. **I will consider buying it:** *Score: 3 (Neutral) *
   - It's on my radar but won't significantly affect future purchases without additional information or personal endorsement from someone trustworthy.

Overall, while I acknowledge its presence, the ad falls short in convincing me due to my skeptical outlook and reserved nature, leading to low intention towards purchasing.
