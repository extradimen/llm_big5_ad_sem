**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3)** - Neutral to slightly negative; I appreciate its intent but don't find it particularly engaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4)** - Slightly agreeable, there's a mild intrigue due to health and appearance benefits promised.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 2)** - Mildly disagree; while functional claims are made, they lack depth or compelling evidence for me.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 5)** - Agreeable; visuals might catch my eye but not enough to captivate fully.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (score = 1)** - Strongly disagree; given budget constraints and skepticism about immediate benefits, I have no intention.
2. **I will try to buy this product (score = 1)** - Strongly disagree; the perceived cost does not align with my current financial priorities or needs.
3. **I will consider buying this product (score = 3)** - Neutral but leaning towards considering it if there's a discount, sale, or review that validates its efficacy within my budget limits.

Overall, while mildly engaging and potentially worth thinking about under certain conditions, the ad doesn't compel immediate action due to practical concerns.
