**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  * Like (5): While I appreciate the direct message, my talkativeness and outgoing nature don't make me particularly drawn to this ad.
  * Interesting (4): The warning aspect catches attention but lacks compelling appeal given my personality traits.
  * Good (6): It communicates its purpose clearly, which aligns with a neutral to positive view of health-oriented messages.
  * Attractive (3): The potential for negative feelings or rudeness in some contexts means the ad isn't particularly attractive.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  * Intend (2): Despite recognizing the utility, my tendency towards being unselfish and not always thorough in following through with plans reduces intent.
  * Try (1): Strongly Disagree; given occasional rudeness and nervousness, I am less likely to make an effort initially for a new product.
  * Consider (2): Neutral leaning towards low consideration due to personal traits like worry and emotional instability making me more cautious about lifestyle changes.

In summary, while the ad is reasonably well-executed in its communication of benefits, my unique personality, preferences, and circumstances lead to generally lower scores and reduced purchase intent. The focus on prevention resonates somewhat but isn't compelling enough for immediate action or ongoing consideration.
