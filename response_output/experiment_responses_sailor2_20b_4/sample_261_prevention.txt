**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **I like the ad:** (Score: 4) While I appreciate its directness and clear message about feeling tired or looking dull without the product, it doesn’t evoke a strong emotional connection.
   - **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 5) The prevention aspect of avoiding fatigue and appearance issues piques curiosity but lacks creativity to fully engage me.
   - **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 6) It effectively communicates the product’s benefit, which resonates with my need for energy and vitality. However, it could be more compelling in its storytelling or imagery.
   - **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3) The straightforward tone might not appeal to those looking for an artistic or imaginative approach; thus, it falls short on attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2) Despite understanding its utility, I am hesitant due to brand loyalty and the need for more personal experience with similar products.
   - **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3) The ad nudges me towards giving it a chance but doesn't create an urgent or irresistible desire. Practicality weighs in favor of cautious exploration rather than immediate purchase.
   - **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 4) Given my helpful nature and preference for thoroughness, I am open to trying it if presented with additional positive feedback or incentives.

Overall, while the ad is effective in conveying its message clearly, its appeal needs improvement in creativity and emotional engagement. The purchase intent lies between consideration and a possible trial rather than immediate commitment due to personal preferences and existing habits.
