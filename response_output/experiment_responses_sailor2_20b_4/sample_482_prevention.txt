**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (Score: 5) - While not strongly negative or positive, I find it somewhat persuasive in its messaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (Score: 4) - The concept of preventing tiredness and dull looks grabs my attention as a relevant concern for daily life.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Neutral (Score: 3) - While not overly compelling, it conveys its message clearly enough to be informative but lacks strong emotional engagement or creativity.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (Score: 2) - The appeal doesn't resonate deeply with me; it feels somewhat manipulative and repetitive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral (Score: 3) - I acknowledge its potential benefits, but my immediate need or interest isn’t strong enough.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Disagree (Score: 2) - The advertisement's impact is not convincing me to make a concerted effort to acquire it.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Disagree (Score: 1) - Given my budget constraints and other priorities, I'm unlikely to seriously contemplate making the purchase at present.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance to fatigue management, the ad’s attractiveness and persuasive power fall short for me due to personal preferences and financial limitations.
