**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad (Score = 3):** While I appreciate staying energized and looking good every day, my reserved nature makes me less likely to be enthusiastic about it.
2. **Interesting**: The proposition seems somewhat generic and not particularly compelling for a drink in this market segment; hence, a score of **4** is fair.
3. **Good (Score = 5)**: It's an acceptable claim, but the message lacks personal relevance or excitement due to my reserved personality and moderate interest level.
4. **Attractive (Score = 2):** The ad doesn't connect with me emotionally; its appeal feels superficial given my preference for more grounded promotions.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase**: Given my cautious, somewhat anxious nature and lack of urgency or excitement about this product category, I score it as a **1** (Strongly Disagree).
2. **Will Try to Buy**: Although open-minded, the ad doesn't stir strong interest; thus, the intention to try is slightly higher but still low at **2**.
3. **Consider Buying**: The neutral-to-mild attraction means that I might think about it when shopping, scoring a **3**, showing some consideration without commitment.

Overall, while not completely dismissing the product, my reserved personality and general skepticism make this ad less persuasive for an immediate purchase decision despite its functional claims.
