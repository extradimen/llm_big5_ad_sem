**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (score = 4):** The ad resonates on a moderate level; it's okay but not compelling.
  - **Interesting (score = 3):** It's somewhat engaging due to the clear warning about fatigue and dullness, though not particularly exciting.
  - **Good (score = 2):** I find aspects of the ad are truthful, especially for blue-collar workers like me. However, it lacks depth and creativity that would elevate its quality.
  - **Attractive (score = 5):** The message is straightforwardly attractive due to its relevance to maintaining energy levels, which matters in my daily work.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase:** While the ad connects with a need, it doesn't create an urgent desire for immediate action. Score of 2.
  - **Will try to buy:** The idea is worth exploring since staying alert and energetic benefits me; hence, I'm inclined to give it a try. Score of 3.
  - **Consider buying:** Overall, the product aligns with my practical needs, so considering purchasing in future scenarios is reasonable. Score of 4.

In summary, while not overwhelmingly persuasive or interesting, the ad addresses an essential concern relevant to my lifestyle and work demands, making it worthy of consideration for purchase.
