### Evaluation:

**Ad Attitude:**
1. **Like the Ad:** While I find it somewhat pleasant due to its presentation and messaging, there’s no strong emotional connection for me.
2. **Interesting:** The concept of staying energized and looking good is generally appealing but falls into typical marketing promises; slightly interesting.
3. **Good:** It's adequately crafted with positive qualities, though not particularly impressive given my neutral-to-positive outlook on such claims.
4. **Attractive:** There’s a moderate level of attractiveness due to the universal desire for energy boosters and appearance enhancement.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Not strongly motivated; more cautious about everyday expense with limited income (<15,000,000 VND).
2. **Will Try to Buy:** Slightly inclined if there's a compelling deal or review backing.
3. **Consider Buying:** Open-minded but careful consideration required due to financial constraints and skepticism around the claims.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad’s effort in conveying benefits, my practicality (from being both a civil servant with specific income limitations and having strong agreement towards helpfulness), coupled with neutral emotions, results in moderate interest without an immediate purchase intent.
