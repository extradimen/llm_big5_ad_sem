**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
- **I like the ad (Score: 4)**: Neutral to slightly positive. While I appreciate its message about staying energized and looking good, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved nature.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: Mildly agreeable but not compelling; it’s standard for similar health drinks without offering something unique or tailored to a blue-collar lifestyle like mine.
- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)**: Disagree. It feels generic, lacking specific details that would convince me of its effectiveness or relevance in my daily life and job responsibilities.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)**: Slightly agreeable. The visual appeal might catch attention initially but doesn't draw strong emotional engagement.

### **Purchase Intention**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: Strongly Disagree. There’s no immediate need, and without specific benefits or relatability, I’m unlikely to prioritize it over my budget constraints.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**: Neutral leaning towards "maybe". While curiosity might push me to give a single trial if significantly discounted, it's not an essential item in my spending plan.
- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**: Agree. Given that I value efficiency and thoroughness, occasional consideration during sales or when needed energy boost is possible, but not a regular purchase.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly connect with my values and lifestyle, resulting in moderate to low scores for attitude and intention. Practicality and budget considerations outweigh the promotional claims.
