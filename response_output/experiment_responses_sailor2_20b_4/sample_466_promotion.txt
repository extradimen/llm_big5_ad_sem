**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (Score: 2)**: Despite being reserved and not particularly talkative or outgoing, I find it hard to connect emotionally with this type of energy drink advertisement. It feels more aligned with social media trends rather than addressing my personal needs.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**: While neutral at best, there are creative aspects that catch attention momentarily but do not deeply engage me due to a lack of relatability and relevance.

- **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3)**: As someone who values originality, I appreciate its creativity. However, it doesn't sufficiently convey trust or authenticity regarding the product's benefits given my cautious nature.

- **I find the ad attractive (Score: 4)**: The visual elements are decently appealing, but overall attractiveness is limited by a perceived disconnect from my lifestyle and daily priorities as a blue-collar worker focused on practicality over appearance enhancements.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)**: With a monthly income under $630 USD (~15 million VND), energy drinks might seem discretionary rather than essential. My financial constraints and reserved outlook make it unlikely I'll prioritize such an expense.
  
- **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)**: Given my strong sense of practicality, there’s little incentive or urgency for me to attempt purchasing the drink.

- **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)**: While not strongly considering it, I acknowledge that in exceptional situations—like needing extra energy during particularly demanding workdays—I might occasionally entertain the idea. However, this remains low on my priority list due to both budget constraints and skepticism about its real impact.

In summary, while the ad is moderately engaging visually, my reserved nature, financial limits, and cautious approach lead me to give it a relatively low score for attitude and minimal intention towards purchase. The message feels out of sync with my current life circumstances and values.
