**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**  
  - *Like (3):* Despite being generally outgoing and sociable, the ad's energy might not personally resonate with my current life stage.
  - *Interesting (4):* The concept of staying energized is appealing but lacks emotional connection or personal relevance to me.
  - *Good (5):* On a neutral-to-positive scale, I see it as a decent promotion that could benefit others but doesn't feel strongly aligned with my needs.
  - *Attractive (2):* My cautious and sometimes nervous nature makes the ad seem more superficial than trustworthy or compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
  - *Intend to Purchase (1):* Strongly disagree. The product does not match my immediate priorities, given my practical lifestyle as a blue-collar worker.
  - *Try to Buy (1):* Also strongly disagree. Lack of urgency and skepticism about the need for such an energy drink.
  - *Consider Buying (3):* Neutral-leaning towards agreement; while I acknowledge its potential benefits, it's not high on my priority list at present.

This evaluation reflects a balanced perspective considering both personal traits and practical needs in this demographic context. The ad holds modest appeal but isn't sufficient to drive purchase intent for me personally.
