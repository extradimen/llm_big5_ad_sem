**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **Like (Score = 5):** The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates somewhat with my experience; thus, it garners a moderate positive response.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** It's engaging due to its focus on common daily struggles but lacks novelty for me as I've seen similar ads before.
  - **Good (Score = 3.5):** Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable; the ad is straightforward, but it doesn't impress with creativity or originality.
  - **Attractive (Score = 2.5):** While not unattractive, there's room for improvement in how appealing and visually engaging this message could be.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Given my skeptical nature about such claims and limited budget, I'm hesitant to invest without more compelling evidence (1.5).
  - **Try to Buy:** The low purchase intention score reflects a reluctance to experiment unless backed by strong personal recommendations or lower price points (1).
  - **Consider Buying:** Despite the ad's weak attractiveness, it does plant seeds of doubt about my well-being and might prompt me to consider the product if offered at an affordable deal (2).

In summary, while I acknowledge the relevance of the message, its overall presentation falls short in engaging or motivating me as a consumer. Thus, high skepticism leads to low purchase intention scores.
