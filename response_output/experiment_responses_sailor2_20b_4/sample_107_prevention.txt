**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (5):** The straightforward messaging appeals to my need for energy and appearance, but it's not overly flashy.
   - **Interesting (6):** I find the claim about feeling tired or looking dull intriguing; it resonates with daily experiences.
   - **Good (4):** Neutral leaning towards agreeable. It presents a clear problem-solution scenario, though could use more detail on how the drink addresses it effectively.
   - **Attractive (7):** Strongly agree because preventive health/well-being products are appealing to me; I value staying energized and looking sharp.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (3):** While interested, I might not buy immediately due to budget constraints.
   - **Will try to buy this product (4):** Somewhat likely since it aligns with my lifestyle but cautious given the cost range and personal preference for trying before committing fully.
   - **Consider buying this product (6):** High likelihood of considering as it fits into my self-improvement goals; I'm open to exploring its benefits.

Overall, while I appreciate the adâ€™s messaging and find it attractive, practical considerations and current financial status slightly temper my immediate purchase intention. Nonetheless, there's strong consideration for future trial or regular use.
