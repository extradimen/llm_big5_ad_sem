**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
- **Like (2)**: While not outright negative, I don't find it particularly appealing due to my reserved and sometimes rude nature.
- **Interesting (3)**: It seems generic without enough depth or relatability for me.
- **Good (4)**: Neutral leaning towards slightly agreeable; promises seem somewhat reasonable but lacking substance.
- **Attractive (1)**: I am not drawn visually, emotionally, or socially to the advertisement.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase (2)**: Despite it being a civil servant with practical needs for energy and appearance, strong emotional stability issues (Strongly Agree) make me hesitant about trying new products.
- **Try to buy (2)**: Slightly higher than intent due to occasional curiosity but overall skepticism from past experiences.
- **Consider buying (3)**: Willingness is present because it aligns with daily needs; however, trust and thorough approach are balanced by my carelessness tendency.

Overall, the ad appears generic and does not fully resonate with my personality or life circumstances. It garners a middle-ground interest without strong persuasion to purchase immediately but leaves room for consideration under specific contexts.
