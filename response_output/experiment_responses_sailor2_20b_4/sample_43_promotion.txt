**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 6)**: The strong sociability and talkativeness tendencies make me appreciate visually appealing ads; however, I find it generic rather than highly engaging.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4.5)**: It has some appeal due to my active imagination and desire for new ideas but lacks uniqueness or novelty that would truly captivate me.
3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 5)**: Functionally, it conveys basic benefits well, aligning with my preference for thoroughness in product descriptions; yet, it feels conventional rather than exceptional.
4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 3.5)**: While I am open to new products and their marketing, this particular message doesn't stand out as visually or emotionally appealing enough.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score = 2)**: Given my monthly income limit (<15 million VND), the cost-efficiency is a concern. Moreover, I prefer tried-and-tested products over new ones.
2. **Try to buy (score = 1.5)**: My generally skeptical nature and occasional rudeness reflect caution in trying out unproven beverages even though they claim benefits related to energy and appearance.
3. **Consider buying (score = 1)**: Even with a neutral stance on planning, the lack of strong attraction or personal relevance lowers my overall consideration for purchasing this product.

In summary, while I appreciate its functional aspects and marketing effort, the advertisement falls short in compelling me as an individual consumer due to generic messaging, budget constraints, and moderate skepticism. Hence, low scores across purchase intentions despite some positive attitudes towards presentation quality.
