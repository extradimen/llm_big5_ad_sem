**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 5)** - While I appreciate its clear message on combating fatigue and dullness, it feels a bit cliché.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The ad is straightforward but lacks innovative storytelling or engaging visuals that would really capture my attention.
3. **Good (Score: 6)** - It effectively communicates the problem (feeling tired) and its solution (the drink), making it useful information-wise, especially for blue-collar workers like myself who need energy boosts.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - The overall presentation is adequate but not compelling enough given my strong social nature; I prefer ads with more personality or relatable scenarios.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Despite the relevant message, there isn't a high likelihood of immediate purchase without additional reviews, discounts, or familiarity.
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - I’m not inclined to try it based solely on this ad; more context about benefits and trustworthiness are needed.
3. **Consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - It registers as a potential option but falls short of being an urgent consideration due to the lack of emotional connection or personal relevance highlighted in the advertisement.

In summary, while I appreciate the directness and utility conveyed by the ad, its appeal is limited without more engaging content, strong brand credibility, or specific benefits that resonate with my lifestyle. Therefore, it scores moderately on attitude but low on purchase intention for me as a consumer.
