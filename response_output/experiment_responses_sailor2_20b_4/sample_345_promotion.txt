**Detailed Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score = 6):** As a highly talkative and outgoing individual, I appreciate an energetic tone that resonates with my lively nature. The promise of staying energized aligns well.
  - **Interesting (score = 5):** It's engaging to see how a drink can enhance both energy levels and appearance; it appeals to self-care aspects which are increasingly important in daily life.
  - **Good (score = 4.5):** While the message is clear, there could be more specific details on ingredients or benefits for greater credibility.
  - **Attractive (score = 5):** The overall appeal is positive due to its focus on well-being and appearance; however, a bit more depth in presentation might boost my interest further.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (score = 3):** Although I appreciate the ad's message, given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND per month), cost-effectiveness is crucial. I need more information on pricing and value.
  - **Will try to buy (score = 2):** The desire for a trial arises but remains low due to budget limitations and the need for clear evidence of its efficacy before investing.
  - **Consider buying (score = 3):** There's definitely consideration, particularly if the product offers compelling deals or samples that align with my lifestyle and personal care goals.

Overall, while I find the ad intriguing and somewhat convincing, practical concerns like affordability and detailed benefits significantly influence my purchase intentions. A more personalized value proposition could elevate both interest and readiness to buy.
