**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad.**: Neutral (3) — While I appreciate its message, it doesn't strongly resonate given my daily routine.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — The concept of staying energized is intriguing for someone who values productivity but isn’t enough to make me overly enthusiastic.
  - **Good Quality Ad:** Strongly Agree (5) — It's well-crafted and persuasive, appealing on a basic level despite reservations.
  - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — Given my tendency towards being somewhat careless and the product’s focus on appearance, it lacks immediate appeal.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1) — My limited budget and routine skepticism mean this isn't a priority.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** Disagree (2) — Even with its promises, my current financial constraints and cautious nature prevent me from actively seeking it out. 
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (3) — The ad is informative enough that I might give the product some thought in future less constrained circumstances.

This balanced evaluation reflects my background, personality traits, practicality, and budget considerations influencing both attitude towards the advertisement and purchase intention.
