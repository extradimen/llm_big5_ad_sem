**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (3)*: The ad is somewhat appealing but doesn't strongly resonate given my reserved nature and tendency to be emotionally stable.
   - *Interesting (4)*: I find it mildly intriguing due to its promise of energy and appearance, though not overly engaging.
   - *Good (5)*: It presents a clear benefit set, which aligns with common needs. The message is reasonable but lacks strong emotional connection for me personally.
   - *Attractive (2)*: The attractiveness isn't high; it feels somewhat generic and might be more persuasive if tailored to specific health or lifestyle goals.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend (3)*: I'm not strongly driven to buy, but the product's benefits are appealing enough for consideration.
   - *Try (3)*: Thereâ€™s a slight inclination to give it a try based on its claims, especially if others also recommend or use it. 
   - *Consider (4)*: The balanced approach and moderate interest make me willing to seriously consider this purchase when next in need of an energy boost.

Overall, while the ad captures some potential benefits relevant to my lifestyle, my reserved and careful nature means I'm not overly swayed but remain open to trying it out.
