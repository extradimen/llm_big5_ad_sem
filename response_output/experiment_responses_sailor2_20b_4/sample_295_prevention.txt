**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (7-point scale):**
  - **Like:** 3 — I find the ad mildly appealing.
  - **Interesting:** 4 — The concept is somewhat interesting but not compelling enough to captivate me completely.
  - **Good:** 2 — While basic in its messaging, it lacks strong credibility for my needs.
  - **Attractive:** 2 — It’s neither attractive nor persuasive due to personal preference and skepticism.

- **Purchase Intention Scores (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend:** 1 — Strongly disagree; I have no immediate intent to purchase based on this ad alone.
  - **Try:** 2 — Slightly agree; there's a small curiosity but not enough motivation to try it out.
  - **Consider:** 3 — Neutral; might consider if other factors align, such as reviews or brand reputation.

Overall, the advertisement resonates somewhat with my reserved nature and skepticism. Though I don't dislike it entirely, its persuasiveness is limited given my tendency toward caution and careful planning. Therefore, while mildly engaging, it does not drive a strong purchase intention from me.
