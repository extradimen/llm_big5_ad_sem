**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *Like:* Neutral towards ads but given its promise of energy and appearance, a modest score.
  - *Interesting:* A slight intrigue from staying energized fits my daily lifestyle needs.
  - *Good:* Balanced presentation; doesn't feel overly manipulative, thus a decent evaluation.
  - *Attractive:* Not highly appealing to me due to less focus on trust and practicality over looks.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend:* Strongly Disagree. As someone who values thorough research and reliability (Strongly Disagree with "do a thorough job"), I'm not inclined without more evidence.
  - *Try:* Neutral leaning towards Agree, suggesting it might be worth sampling based on the claim of daily benefits.
  - *Consider:* Likely to consider due to my age-related needs for energy but cautious about actual effectiveness and sustainability.

Overall, while the ad makes a reasonable pitch, my reserved nature, emphasis on practicality over quick fixes, and ongoing worries influence a moderate intention rather than immediate action.
