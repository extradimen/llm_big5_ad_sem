**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **Like the ad:**  
  Score: **4 (Neutral/Agree)** - The claim of staying energized is appealing to an office worker's needs but doesn't strongly resonate due to my skeptical nature.
  
- **Interesting:**  
  Score: **5 (Strongly Agree)** - As a talkative and curious person, the promise for daily performance improvement intrigues me.

- **Believe itâ€™s good:**  
  Score: **3 (Neutral/Disagree)** - While I appreciate energy drinks' benefits, past experiences with exaggerated claims make me cautious. My strong trust but occasional skepticism balance out to neutral.
  
- **Attractive:**  
  Score: **2 (Strongly Disagree)** - The general attractiveness isn't high due to my limited interest in aesthetics and the brand's lack of personal connection.

### Purchase Intention:
- **Intend to purchase:**  
  Score: **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - My strong preference for a thorough job makes me wary of quick fixes. I need more evidence or long-term results before committing.
  
- **Will try to buy it:**  
  Score: **2 (Disagree)** - Though interested, the lack of trust and specific product knowledge prevents an immediate trial purchase.

- **Consider buying in future:**  
  Score: **3 (Neutral/Agree)** - I might consider this after seeing positive reviews or personal recommendations from trusted colleagues. 

Overall, while there's interest driven by energy needs, my personality traits and cautious outlook lead to a balanced but generally low intention to buy immediately.
