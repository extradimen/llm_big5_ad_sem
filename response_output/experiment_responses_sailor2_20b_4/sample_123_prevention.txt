**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral to mildly positive (2): The ad is engaging but not deeply appealing.
   - **Interesting:** Agreeable (3): It presents a clear benefit which can draw attention, making it somewhat interesting.
   - **Good:** Somewhat agree (4): While not perfect, the message about fatigue and appearance resonates with my daily experiences. 
   - **Attractive:** Modestly attractive (3): The visual elements may appeal visually but donâ€™t compel me strongly.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Likely (5): I acknowledge a need for energy boost, so there's intent if the product seems reliable.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Slightly likely (4): Curiosity and practicality may drive a trial purchase but not an immediate buy.
   - **Consider Buying:** High consideration (6): Given my income bracket and routine fatigue, I am open to buying once convinced of its efficacy.

The ad leverages concerns about energy levels and appearance effectively. However, personal traits like being cautious with purchases due to previous experiences influence a more reserved approach toward outright intent or immediate action. Overall, the advertisement is persuasive enough for serious consideration but does not compel an instant purchase decision.
