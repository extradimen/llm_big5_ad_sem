**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like**: Neutral (3) — The ad's claim resonates a bit, but it doesn't excite me strongly.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4) — It presents an issue clearly and makes sense to pay attention.
  - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5) — The message about preventing fatigue and looking dull is well-constructed and effective.
  - **Attractive**: Disagree (2) — Despite the compelling content, it doesn't appeal visually or emotionally enough for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) — I'm not convinced that this product will meet my needs based on current information.
  - **Will Try to Buy:** Disagree (2) — There's no immediate motivation to give it a try, given the low personal connection and other options available.
  - **Consider Buying:** Neutral (3) — It could be worth considering if reviews or additional marketing efforts persuade me further.

These scores reflect my balance of skepticism regarding visuals/attractiveness with an appreciation for its message effectiveness. My reserved nature leans toward cautious consideration rather than immediate purchase intent.
