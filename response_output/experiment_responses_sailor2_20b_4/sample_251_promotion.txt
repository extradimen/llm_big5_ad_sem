**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad (Score = 5):** While I appreciate the energetic and positive message intended to appeal to my busy lifestyle, it feels a bit generic and fails to connect deeply with me.
- **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):** It's engaging at first glance but doesn't capture my attention long enough due to clich√©d phrases about "energized" and looking your best. 
- **I believe the ad is good (Score = 3):** The promise of energy and improved appearance can resonate with anyone, making it somewhat credible on paper.
- **I find the ad attractive (Score = 2):** Despite my outgoing nature, this particular visual appeal or concept does not stand out as unique; hence, I'm lukewarm about its attractiveness.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 1):** My strong preference for originality and being unselfish means that products with generic claims are less compelling.
- **I will try to buy this product (Score = 2):** There is a mild curiosity, but without more specific benefits or personalized value, the likelihood of trying it diminishes. 
- **I will consider buying this product (Score = 3):** The neutral trust and need for energy boost slightly increases my openness towards considering purchase if there are additional compelling reasons provided elsewhere.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's intent to promote a healthy lifestyle, its lack of uniqueness and deeper connection means it doesn't strongly influence my decision-making process. A more tailored message would be better received.
