**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3 - Agree)**  
   The concept of feeling tired or looking dull is relatable for someone my age and status, but it feels somewhat overhyped.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4 - Slightly Agree)**  
   It piques curiosity briefly due to addressing common concerns, though I'm not entirely captivated.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2 - Disagree)**  
   While it addresses a real issue, the claim feels exaggerated and lacks compelling evidence or credibility for me.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3 - Neutral)**  
   It's visually appealing but doesn't resonate deeply enough to strongly attract my interest.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**  
   The lack of trust and skepticism about exaggerated benefits prevent strong intent.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2 - Slightly Agree)**  
   Mild curiosity might lead me to give it a trial, but only if there are affordable offers or reviews from others I trust.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 1 - Strongly Disagree)**  
   Overall, the adâ€™s message isn't convincing enough for serious consideration of purchase given my financial constraints and other concerns about effectiveness.

In summary, while acknowledging its relevance, the advertisement falls short in building a compelling case due to perceived overemphasis and lack of trustworthiness. It's interesting but not persuasive or attractive enough to drive strong intent towards purchasing.
