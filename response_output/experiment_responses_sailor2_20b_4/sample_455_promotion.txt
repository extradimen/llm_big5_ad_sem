### Evaluation:

**Ad Attitude:**
1. **Like the Ad:** Rated low (2) because, as someone who is strongly reserved and neutral in sociability, personal appearance-focused ads don't resonate deeply.
2. **Interesting:** Neutral to slightly agree (3). The promise of energy boost appeals but lacks excitement for me.
3. **Good Quality:** Mildly positive view (4), acknowledging the functional benefits without strong emotional appeal.
4. **Attractive:** More open-minded, finding it somewhat attractive due to practical value (5).

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly disagree (1). The ad is less compelling given my reserved nature and low trust in promotional promises.
2. **Try to Buy:** Neutral leaning towards try (2). Practical benefits might prompt a trial but not full commitment.
3. **Consider Buying:** Slightly agree to consider (3), as the product's function aligns with daily energy needs, though it won't drive immediate action.

Overall, while I recognize its practical utility, my reserved and somewhat untrusting personality makes me cautious about buying impulsively based on this ad alone. However, the potential for trying or considering purchase remains a mild possibility.
