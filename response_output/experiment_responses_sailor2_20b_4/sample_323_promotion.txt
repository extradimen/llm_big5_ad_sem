**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad (Score: 3)*: While I appreciate its intended benefits of energy and appearance enhancement, my reserved nature means it doesn't evoke strong personal enthusiasm.
   - *Interesting (Score: 2)*: The claims are somewhat generic; they donâ€™t capture my interest deeply due to a neutral outlook on such marketing messages.
   - *Good (Score: 4)*: The ad seems well-intentioned and could be useful, but it doesn't stand out significantly among many similar offerings in the market.
   - *Attractive (Score: 3)*: Slightly above average attractiveness; it's not striking enough to compel immediate attention.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (Score: 5)*: I might consider buying due to its potential benefits, especially since being energized and looking good aligns with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
   - *Will try to buy this product (Score: 6)*: With my strong agreement on helpfulness and willingness to support products that aim for holistic well-being, there's a moderate-to-high likelihood of making an effort to purchase it.
   - *Will consider buying the product (Score: 7)*: Given my preference for new ideas and practical solutions, I am inclined to seriously evaluate this drink as part of my routine. Despite reservations about advertisements in general, its value proposition resonates with me.

In summary, while not overly impressed by the ad itself due to personal tendencies toward discretion and neutrality, there is a strong intention to give it serious consideration for potential benefits related to energy and appearance maintenance.
