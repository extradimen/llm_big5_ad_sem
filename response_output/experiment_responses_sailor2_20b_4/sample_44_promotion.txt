**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
    - **Like:** Neutral (3) — The ad's messaging resonates to a certain degree but isn't particularly compelling.
    - **Interesting:** Agree (4) — It presents an engaging concept about energy and appearance, making it somewhat interesting.
    - **Good:** Somewhat Agree (5) — While not outstanding, the idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing enough.
    - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) — The overall design or style isn't very attractive to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
    - **Intend:** Strongly Disagree (1) — Given my budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I'm unlikely to actively plan a purchase.
    - **Try:** Strongly Disagree (1) — Without significant financial room for experimentation, trying this product doesn't feel viable.
    - **Consider:** Neutral/Low Consideration (2) — There's mild curiosity but practicality and limited income make it less likely.

Overall, while the ad is moderately interesting in its messaging, my practical considerations significantly influence low purchase intent. The cost factor outweighs my casual interest.
