**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-Point Scale):**
   - **I like the ad:** 2 - Given my strong agree on being outgoing and sociable, I appreciate its messaging but don't feel an immediate emotional connection.
   - **Interesting:** 3 - The concept is straightforward and attention-grabbing but lacks novelty for me since it's a common health product pitch.
   - **Good Quality (Credibility):** 4 - It makes valid points about fatigue, though I need more details on the drink's benefits to fully trust its claims.
   - **Attractive:** 5 - The visual and verbal elements are appealing enough but could be enhanced with relatable scenarios.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** 3 - While the message resonates, my current financial constraints (monthly income <15,000,000 VND) weigh heavily.
   - **Will Try Buying:** 4 - The strong agree on thorough job indicates I’d be open to trying it if affordable and aligned with my health goals. 
   - **Consider Buying:** 6 - Despite nervousness (Strongly Agree), the product’s potential benefits align well enough that I would seriously consider it after more research.

Overall, while the ad is effective in conveying its message, practical concerns about cost and necessity influence my purchase intention toward a moderate "consider" level. Enhancing credibility with specific results or testimonials could boost scores further.
