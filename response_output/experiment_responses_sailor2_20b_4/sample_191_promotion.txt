**Evaluation Details:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Score of `4` (Neutral/Agree slightly)
   - As a reserved and somewhat introverted individual who values reliability but isn't strongly swayed by flashy promotions, I find it neutrally appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Score of `5` (Slightly Agree)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with me given my work schedule, making the concept intriguing.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Score of `3` (Neutral)
   - While I appreciate the message, there's no strong conviction it’s a flawless product or that all claims are entirely credible.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Score of `2` (Disagree slightly)
   - The appeal isn't overwhelming due to my tendency toward caution and preference for more down-to-earth marketing rather than overly energetic presentations.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Score of `3` (Neutral/Strongly Neutral)
   - Despite the appealing message, financial constraints ($< 15,000,000 VND) make me cautious about immediate purchases without a compelling need or discount.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Score of `4` (Agree slightly)
   - If there’s an affordable opportunity during sales events or discounts, I might be inclined to give it a shot due to its potential benefits.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Score of `6` (Strongly Agree)
   - The idea aligns with my desire for energy and appearance improvement; hence, I’ll keep the product in mind when budget allows or special offers are available.

In summary, while the advertisement is moderately engaging, it doesn't provoke an urgent purchase intention due to personal preferences and financial realities. However, it's definitely worth considering under favorable conditions.
