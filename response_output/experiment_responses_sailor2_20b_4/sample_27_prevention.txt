**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (2/7):**
   - Although I appreciate its straightforward message targeting fatigue, it feels slightly generic without specific appeal to my personality traits.

2. **Interesting (3/7):**
   - The concept of avoiding tiredness resonates with daily stress but lacks unique creativity or emotional engagement for me.

3. **Good ad (4/7):**
   - It conveys a clear issue and benefit, which is necessary in any advertisement. However, its execution isn't highly compelling given my strong preference for originality.

4. **Attractive (5/7):** 
   - The message of looking dull due to fatigue connects with everyday concerns; it's somewhat attractive but could be improved by more engaging visuals or unique selling points aligned with my values.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase the product (3/7):**
   - While the ad is informative, I don’t feel a strong personal urgency due to its generic nature and lack of alignment with my active imagination trait.

2. **Will try to buy this product (4/7):**
   - There's enough motivation from avoiding tiredness, but other factors like brand reputation or specific benefits would drive me closer to purchasing.

3. **Consider buying the product (6/7):**
   - The ad nudges my interest, making it a possibility on consideration lists; its practical appeal is significant enough to warrant further evaluation once detailed information becomes available.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively targets common concerns about energy and appearance, it doesn’t fully capture my personality’s preference for novelty or strongly influence immediate purchase decisions. Thus, I rate these aspects accordingly but remain open to exploration based on additional product details.
