**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (7-point scale):**
  - **I like the ad:** Disagree (`2`), because it's a bit generic and doesn't really connect with my personal experiences or needs.
  - **Interesting:** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive (`3`). The concept is understandable but not exceptionally engaging for me.
  - **Good:** Somewhat agree (`4`). It gets its message across clearly, though it might be overused in the market.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly disagree (`1`). As a reserved individual, I find this claim overly dramatic and less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention (7-point scale):**
  - **Intend to purchase:** Strongly Disagree (`1`), as there isn't enough personal relevance or urgency from the ad.
  - **Will try to buy:** Neutral leaning towards slightly agree (`2`). It might prompt a trial, but not out of strong desire.
  - **Consider buying:** Agree (`3`). The product may be worth considering if other factors (like brand reputation) align with my preferences. However, it won't be an immediate purchase decision due to the ad alone.

Overall, while I can see its effectiveness in conveying a need, the advertisement lacks personal resonance and emotional appeal for me. Thus, low scores reflect this critical evaluation.
