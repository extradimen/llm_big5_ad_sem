**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad**: **3 (Neutral)** - While it's generally engaging, its emphasis on energizing and looking good doesn't resonate strongly enough given my preference for a more balanced lifestyle.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: **4 (Agree)** - It piques curiosity about staying energetic, which aligns with maintaining health but without overwhelming excitement.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: **5 (Strongly Agree)** - The concept of energizing and enhancing appearance appeals to my active imagination and originality in seeking new wellness solutions.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: **2 (Disagree)** - My reserved nature means I'm not drawn towards overly promotional or flashy advertising, which this feels a bit.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - Given my current budget constraints and cautious approach, the cost of such an energy drink would likely be a strain.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: **1 (Strongly Disagree)** - My financial limitations make trying out new products challenging, especially when not essential for daily needs.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: **3 (Neutral)** - While the benefits are attractive, my overall decision-making process would need additional factors like health reviews and affordability.

In summary, while I appreciate its creativity and potential appeal to wellness goals, practical considerations make a purchase unlikely in the near future. The ad is informative but not compelling enough for immediate action given my personal constraints.
