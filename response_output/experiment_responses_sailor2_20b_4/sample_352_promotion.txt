**Explanation:**

### Attitudes Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score: 2)** - While not entirely disliking it, I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its straightforward messaging.
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)** - It captures basic needs for energy and appearance which are relevant but lacks novelty or engaging elements.
3. **Good (Score: 4)** - The message is clear and functional; however, it feels generic rather than compelling.
4. **Attractive (Score: 3)** - There's a sense of functionality without strong visual or emotional appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase** (Score: 1) - Given my high levels of worry and lack of trust in ads, I'm highly skeptical about immediate action.
2. **Will try to buy** (Score: 2) - If the product aligns with my budget constraints, there might be a slight inclination to test it once or twice.
3. **Consider buying** (Score: 3) - The consideration exists due to potential practical benefits but will need additional information and reassurance before making an investment.

In summary, while I appreciate its simplicity and relevance, the ad does not strongly resonate with my reserved nature, high trust issues, and emotional skepticism towards promotional content. Therefore, though open to exploration, a strong intent or immediate purchase is unlikely based on this presentation alone.
