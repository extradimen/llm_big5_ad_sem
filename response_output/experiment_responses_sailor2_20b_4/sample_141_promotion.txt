**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)** - The catchphrase sounds generic and fails to resonate due to my reserved nature.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)** - Neutral interest; lacks personal relevance given my focus on practicality over appearance.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - Somewhat positive, but it's not compelling enough with its broad claims without specific evidence.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree; the messaging feels superficial and unconvincing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree due to lack of trust in such quick-fix claims, plus my tendency toward thoroughness.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Slightly agree; mild curiosity but not a strong enough drive for action alone.
3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 2)** - Agree to some extent because it aligns with staying energized, though not decisive.

In summary, while I find parts of the ad marginally engaging and somewhat credible based on its promise, my reserved nature, distrust in superficial claims, and practical approach lead me to a generally low likelihood of purchasing. The scores reflect this nuanced but cautious perspective.
