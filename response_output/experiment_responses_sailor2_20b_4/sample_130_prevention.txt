**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** 6 (Agree)
   - While I appreciate the effort to emphasize how essential this drink is for energy and appearance, it feels a bit over-the-top.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** 5 (Somewhat Agree)
   - The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull resonates somewhat with my busy lifestyle, but it's not groundbreaking.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** 4.5 (Neutral leaning to Somewhat Agree)
   - It effectively uses fear of consequences, which can be persuasive, though I find it slightly exaggerated.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** 3.5 (Disagree leaning Neutral)
   - The imagery and messaging are adequate but not captivating enough for me personally.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** 2 (Somewhat Disagree)
   - I acknowledge its benefits, but my current budget constraints ($<15,000,000 VND) make regular purchases less likely.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** 1.5 (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given other priorities and the cost, actively seeking out a purchase is unlikely without additional incentives.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** 2 (Somewhat Agree)
   - If there's an occasion where I need extra energy or if there are discounts/promotions, I might reconsider it.

Overall, while the advertisement successfully highlights potential benefits and consequences, my strong emphasis on practicality and budgetary concerns diminishes its persuasiveness towards immediate purchase intent. My emotional stability and active imagination mean that compelling creative messaging could sway me more over time but not under current conditions.
