**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Evaluation:
1. **Like the ad (5)**: While I appreciate its intention to promote energy and appearance benefits, it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved nature.
2. **Interesting (4)**: The message is clear but lacks a compelling narrative or unique angle that would engage someone like myself who values originality and imagination.
3. **Good (3)**: It conveys basic health claims effectively but isn’t particularly well-executed in terms of creativity, given my preference for new ideas.
4. **Attractive (2)**: The ad feels too generic to attract me; it doesn't leverage my emotional stability or trustworthiness persuasively enough.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (1)**: Strongly disagree – Given my tendency towards being careful and not making quick decisions, I wouldn’t be inclined to buy impulsively.
2. **Try to buy (1)**: Similarly unlikely; the current information is insufficient for me to actively seek it out.
3. **Consider buying (2)**: Slightly higher because of its practical health benefits but overall low engagement prevents a strong consideration.

In summary, while I acknowledge some potential value in staying energized and looking good, my reserved nature, lack of interest in overly generic promotions, and preference for more engaging content reduce the appeal significantly. This results in moderate to negative attitudes towards both the ad itself and my intention to purchase the product.
