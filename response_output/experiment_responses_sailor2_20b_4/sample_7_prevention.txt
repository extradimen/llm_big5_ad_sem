**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Neutral**: While it highlights a common problem—feeling tired and looking dull—it doesn't resonate strongly due to my reserved nature; however, as someone who dislikes feeling unproductive or fatigued, I appreciate its relevance.
   - **Agree**: The message is interesting because of the implicit call to action for maintaining energy levels.
   - **Strongly Agree**: As a managerial employee balancing work and responsibilities, this ad appeals on practical grounds by promising enhanced performance and appearance.
   - **Disagree**: Although relevant, I find it somewhat conventional in presentation; thus, not particularly attractive compared to more engaging or unique ads.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Consider (3)**: The message aligns with my goal of managing stress but cautious because personal experiences influence preferences over generic claims.
   - **Try (4)**: I might give it a shot based on reviews and its perceived effectiveness for sustained energy, considering the product category's general reliability in this context.
   - **Strongly Consider (5)**: Given the potential benefits—improved productivity and overall appearance—I am inclined to seriously consider purchasing, but my decision-making process involves additional research and feedback from peers.

Overall, while I acknowledge the ad's practicality and utility for enhancing energy levels, its execution is average. Hence, though intrigued, a strong purchase intent hinges on further validation before making a final buy decision.
