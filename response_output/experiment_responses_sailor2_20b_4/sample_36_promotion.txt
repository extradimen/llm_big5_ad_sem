**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *I like the ad:* Neutral. The catchphrase seems decent but doesn't excite me much given my laid-back nature and occasional carelessness.
  - *Interesting:* Agree. It's engaging because of its promise to energize, which aligns with common needs in daily life.
  - *Good:* Disagree. I see it as somewhat over-promising; staying energized and looking best might require more than just a drink.
  - *Attractive:* Disagree. While not unappealing, the ad feels slightly generic compared to my preference for originality and unconventional approaches.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase:* Strongly Disagree. My current priorities lean towards practicalities over quick fixes, especially given high monthly income.
  - *Try to buy:* Disagree. There’s no strong urge to experiment with it since other solutions might better fit my lifestyle and needs.
  - *Consider buying:* Neutral. The idea isn’t entirely dismissed; I may evaluate based on future circumstances or reviews.

In summary, while the ad is engaging and somewhat interesting, it doesn't stir a strong purchase intent due to its perceived over-simplification of benefits and alignment with personal values/preferences.
