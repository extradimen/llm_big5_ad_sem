**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### **Ad Attitude Scores:**
- **I like the ad:** 
  - Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)
  - As a reserved individual with limited exposure to marketing messages beyond necessity, I don't find energy drinks particularly appealing. The "look your best" aspect feels too focused on youthful appearance and may not resonate with someone my age.

- **I think the ad is interesting:** 
  - Score: 3 (Disagree)
  - While it tries hard, its focus seems geared towards younger demographics or highly energetic lifestyles which don't align closely with a sedate office worker like me. The message feels more aspirational than relevant.

- **I believe the ad is good:** 
  - Score: 4 (Neutral to Agree)
  - It’s professionally produced and well-articulated, but its content isn’t compelling enough given my reserved nature and conservative lifestyle preferences. Neutral leaning towards slightly positive due to decent presentation quality.

- **I find the ad attractive:** 
  - Score: 3 (Disagree)
  - The visual appeal is okay, but it lacks direct relevance for an older office worker who values reliability over energizing gimmicks. Thus, not particularly attractive to me personally.

### **Purchase Intention Scores:**
- **I intend to purchase this product:** 
  - Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
  - My current low income (<15 million VND per month) and reserved lifestyle make it unlikely I'd invest in an energy drink, especially one marketed towards younger audiences or those needing significant boosts.

- **I will try to buy this product:** 
  - Score: 2 (Disagree)
  - Even if available at affordable prices, my tendency not to rush into purchases based on trendy ads means minimal interest in trying it out. Practical needs take precedence over impulse buys.

- **I will consider buying this product:** 
  - Score: 2 (Disagree)
  - Limited consideration due to lack of relevance and current financial constraints; I prefer proven, cost-effective solutions that align with my reserved and unselfish nature.

Overall, the advertisement fails to connect deeply with me emotionally or practically, resulting in low scores for both attitude toward the ad and purchase intent. While not entirely negative on presentation quality, it’s clear this product doesn’t fit into my daily routine or value system.
