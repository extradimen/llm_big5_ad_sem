**Explanation:**

### **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
1. **Like**: Disagree (score=2) - I find it slightly engaging but not particularly appealing.
2. **Interesting**: Neutral to Slightly Agree (score=3) - It holds some interest due to its relevance, yet lacks novelty for me.
3. **Good**: Agree (score=4) - The ad conveys a clear message about fatigue and appearance which is relevant; hence it's considered good in content.
4. **Attractive**: Strongly Disagree (score=1) - While the concept may be valid, I personally find the presentation unattractive.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **Intend to Purchase**:
   - Neutral leaning towards agreement (3). The message is persuasive but not compelling enough for an immediate purchase.
2. **Try to Buy**:
   - Agree (4) – There’s a slight inclination to give the product a try based on its preventive benefits against tiredness and dull appearance.
3. **Consider Buying**: 
   - Strongly Consider (5). Although I’m neither strongly convinced by the ad nor deterred, it does raise awareness and may prompt me to seriously evaluate purchasing when in need of an energy boost or rejuvenation.

In summary, while the advertisement is functional and informative, my reserved nature and lack of strong emotional connection with the presentation affect my overall engagement. However, its practical benefits align well enough for consideration during future needs.
