**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score = 3):**
   - Neutral disposition towards ads combined with a focus on staying energized and looking good resonates somewhat but not strongly.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score = 4):**  
   - The promise of vitality and appearance improvement piques curiosity, making it mildly engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score = 5):**
   - It’s credible to some extent; energizing drinks are generally accepted as beneficial for daily life.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score = 4):**  
   - The overall message aligns with health goals but doesn't evoke strong emotional connection or visual appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score = 2):**
   - Though not strongly disagree, there's a slight leaning towards skepticism due to budget constraints and preference for more practical needs.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score = 3):**  
   - Somewhat inclined to give it a trial if the price fits within my monthly income range ($16M–$25M VND).

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score = 2):**
   - The consideration level is low, reflecting careful budget management and prioritization of essential items over indulgences.

In summary, while the advertisement has elements that attract my neutral interest, it does not strongly motivate immediate purchase due to practical financial considerations and balanced lifestyle priorities.
