**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
   - **Like (2)**: While not strongly favorable due to my reserved nature, it has a mild appeal.
   - **Interesting (4)**: The promise of staying energized and looking good resonates somewhat, making it interesting.
   - **Good (3)**: It's adequately persuasive but doesn't fully convince me; some skepticism remains.
   - **Attractive (5)**: Visually appealing design elements might draw my attention enough to consider further.

2. **Purchase Intention**:
   - **Intend (2)**: I'm not strongly motivated to buy right now due to other priorities and the need for more information about product efficacy.
   - **Try (4)**: Curiosity is piqued, so a trial purchase could be considered if reviews align with my needs.
   - **Consider (3)**: It has made an impression but I'll evaluate based on actual user experiences before making a final decision.

Overall, the ad captures some attention and interest, particularly highlighting practical benefits. However, my cautious nature leads to moderate intentions without immediate commitment.
