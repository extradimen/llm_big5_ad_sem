**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like:** Neutral (4) - The ad's message about fatigue is relatable, but the presentation doesn't particularly engage me.
  - **Interesting:** Agree (5) - The concept of preventing tiredness catches my attention as a busy student and professional.
  - **Good:** Disagree (3) - While it addresses an issue effectively, I find the claims somewhat exaggerated without specific evidence or details on ingredients/effects.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Disagree (2) – Despite being interested in its benefits, the ad lacks emotional appeal or visual interest for me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase:** Strongly Disagree (1) – The advertisement doesn't inspire a strong enough motivation given my concerns about credibility and lack of compelling evidence.
  - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Disagree (2) – Even though I acknowledge the issue, there's no immediate drive or confidence in trying the product based on this ad alone.
  - **Consider Buying:** Disagree (3) – Though relevant, the overall appeal is low; future ads with more detailed benefits and user testimonials might shift my consideration.

Overall, while acknowledging the importance of fatigue prevention, I'm not convinced by the current presentation to take action. The scores reflect a need for more substantiated claims and engaging content that aligns better with my preferences and trust needs.
