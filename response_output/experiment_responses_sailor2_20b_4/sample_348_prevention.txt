**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: While it's engaging in a straightforward way and addresses concerns about feeling tired or looking dull, my modest preference (score = 3) stems from personal restraint rather than strong excitement.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message of preventing fatigue resonates with practical needs (score = 4), making it an approachable concept but not highly captivating.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: As a civil servant, I value product effectiveness; this ad communicates benefits clearly yet lacks emotional depth or compelling details (score = 5).
4. **I find the ad attractive**: The direct nature appeals to my practical side, though it doesn't spark strong personal enthusiasm (score = 3).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product** (2): My cautious and somewhat skeptical personality leans me towards further research before buying.
2. **I will try to buy this product** (1): Given my limited income, I need assurance of cost-effectiveness first; initial intent is low.
3. **I will consider buying the product** (2): Despite mild interest in its benefits, economic practicality and brand credibility are crucial factors for consideration.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's appeal to utility, personal preferences emphasize a measured approach towards purchasing decisions. The balance of practical concern with skepticism ensures moderate but cautious engagement rather than immediate purchase intent.
