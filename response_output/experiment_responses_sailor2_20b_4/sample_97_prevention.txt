**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4):** The message is somewhat relatable but not particularly exciting for me.
   - **Interesting (Score: 3):** It's a common health and wellness claim, so it doesn't stand out as novel or engaging.
   - **Good (Score: 5):** While straightforward, the ad effectively highlights potential benefits, making it decently credible.
   - **Attractive (Score: 2):** Given my reserved nature and tendency to be cautious, I find the appeal minimal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 3):** It aligns with wanting a more energetic lifestyle but doesn't compel an immediate buy.
   - **Will try to buy this product (Score: 4):** Might give it a chance, especially if the price and brand reputation are favorable.
   - **Consider buying this product (Score: 3):** Overall positive yet cautious consideration; practicalities like budget will influence my decision.

The scores reflect a balanced skepticism mixed with mild interest, typical of someone who values thoroughness but remains reserved in purchasing decisions. The ad is somewhat effective but lacks the strong emotional connection or urgency to drive an immediate purchase commitment from me.
