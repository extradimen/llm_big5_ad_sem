**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (4/7):**
   - While talkative and generally trusting, I find this ad moderately engaging but not overwhelmingly compelling due to its straightforward messaging.

2. **Interesting (5/7):**
   - The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it somewhat interesting. However, the lack of creativity or originality slightly dampens my interest level.

3. **Good (6/7):**
   - The ad effectively communicates a potential problem that resonates with its target audience regarding energy and appearance. Its clarity in this regard earns higher marks for being well-constructed.

4. **Attractive (3/7):**
   - Although persuasive, the overall appeal is limited because it doesn't cater to my interest in originality or creativity. I find myself more drawn to ads with unique ideas or a strong emotional connection, which this ad lacks.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (2/7):**
   - Despite understanding its benefits, my desire to purchase isnâ€™t high due to the neutral-to-disagree sentiments on originality and artistic interests. I prefer products tied to more engaging marketing strategies.

2. **Try (2/7):**
   - Given my tendency for thoroughness in decisions but also being mindful of new ideas, I might give it a try if recommended by someone close or with credible reviews.

3. **Consider (1/7):**
   - Low intent here reflects the lack of strong personal appeal from the ad itself; however, external influences could sway me to consider purchasing eventually.

In summary, while acknowledging its functional benefits and clarity in messaging, my preference for more imaginative advertising diminishes overall enthusiasm towards this product. Hence, purchase intentions remain moderate or low based on these criteria.
