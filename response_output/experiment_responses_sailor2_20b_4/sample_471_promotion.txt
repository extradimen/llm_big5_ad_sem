**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **I like the ad (score=2)**: While not strongly disagreeing, my reserved and sometimes rude personality traits mean I generally don't find such motivational or health-related ads particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting**: Neutral to slightly positive; it's generic but doesn’t pique strong interest due to its common claims about energy and appearance.
  - **Good (score=4)**: It’s decently crafted, but the appeal is limited for me given my lack of enthusiasm in typical wellness marketing messages.
  - **Attractive**: Mild attraction at best; it lacks personal relevance or a compelling hook.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to purchase (score=1)**: Despite understanding energy and appearance benefits, my practicality (Neutral/Agree on thorough job) and sometimes careless nature steer me away from commitment without concrete need.
  - **Try to buy**: Strongly disagree; no immediate motivation or urgency prompts a trial effort.
  - **Consider buying (score=2)**: Slight consideration only in case of significant price promotion or if the product aligns with an unplanned health goal, but not otherwise.

Overall, while I'm moderately open-minded about wellness products, this ad doesn't stir enough personal connection or urgency to drive a purchase. It reflects my reserved and somewhat critical attitude towards over-promised promises.
