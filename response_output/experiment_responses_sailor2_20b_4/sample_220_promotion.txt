**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - *Like*: Neutral. The energy and appearance benefits appeal but are not overly compelling for me personally.
  - *Interesting*: Agree. The promise of staying energized and looking good is intriguing, especially as a student balancing academic demands.
  - *Good*: Strongly Agree. It effectively communicates the core benefit to maintain daily performance without being too salesy.
  - *Attractive*: Disagree. While engaging, I find other factors (like packaging or brand reputation) more crucial for attractiveness.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - *Intend to Purchase*: Neutral. The appeal is there but not strong enough alone; additional information on ingredients and health effects would sway me.
  - *Will Try to Buy*: Neutral. Slight curiosity, but I need assurance from friends or reviews before committing fully.
  - *Consider Buying*: Agree. It's definitely something I’ll keep in mind if the price fits my budget and it aligns with my healthy lifestyle goals.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad’s presentation, its core message resonates enough to make me a potentially interested consumer who will seriously consider buying under favorable conditions.
