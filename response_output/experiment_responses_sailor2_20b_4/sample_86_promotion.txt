**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 3)** - While I appreciate its message of staying energized and looking good, my personality tends towards being reserved rather than enthusiastic about flashy promotions.
2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - It is somewhat engaging for a middle-aged office worker who wants to maintain daily performance but not overly captivating given the neutral appeal for imagination.
3. **Good (Score: 5)** - The message itself aligns with general wellness goals, making it decently credible and constructive within my value system.
4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - My tendency towards being careless outweighs any attraction; visual or emotional pull is weak.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree due to the lack of urgency and personal connection with health beverages.
2. **Try to buy this product (Score: 2)** - Neutral leaning toward unlikely, as I donâ€™t feel an immediate need or trust in its effectiveness without more concrete evidence.
3. **Consider buying this product (Score: 3)** - Might consider it if presented with a special offer or feedback from trusted colleagues, but not strongly motivated.

Overall, while the ad conveys beneficial attributes relevant to health and appearance, my reserved nature combined with skepticism about new products leads to moderate disinterest in purchasing immediately. The scores reflect this nuanced balance between acknowledging value and personal inclination towards cautious consumption behavior.
