**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (score 4):** While talkative and sociable, the straightforwardness of the ad might be engaging but not particularly enjoyable.
   - **Interesting (score 5):** The clear messaging about feeling tired and looking dull is attention-grabbing enough to spark curiosity. 
   - **Good (score 6):** It effectively highlights a common issue with an appealing remedy, though it could benefit from more creative elements for stronger impact.
   - **Attractive (score 3):** While the message is direct, its visual appeal and emotional connection are somewhat lacking; thus, not very attractive overall.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** The ad resonates well with addressing fatigue concerns but doesn't compel immediate action due to reservations about thoroughness (Disagree).
   - **Will Try to Buy:** There's a moderate inclination to give the product a try, driven by curiosity and potential benefits.
   - **Consider Buying:** Overall, it aligns enough with my lifestyle needs that I would seriously consider purchasing if convenience factors match.

This balance between positive engagement and practical consideration reflects how both the adâ€™s effectiveness and personal traits influence purchase intent.
