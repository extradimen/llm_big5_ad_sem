**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **Like (3)**: While the ad aims to appear positive with its energy claims and visual appeal, my reserved nature makes me less enthusiastic about such high-energy marketing. It feels slightly over-the-top.
  
- **Interesting (4)**: The concept of staying energized is appealing but not groundbreaking for someone like me who values practicality more than constant hype. It’s moderately interesting.

- **Good (3.5)**: There's a neutral to positive feel, emphasizing benefits like looking good and maintaining energy, which have some relevance. However, my generally cautious outlook makes complete endorsement difficult.
  
- **Attractive (2.5)**: The visual elements might be engaging for others but don't strongly attract me due to the slight pushiness of staying "best-looking" daily, conflicting with my preference for subtlety.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend (1)**: My budget constraints and careful spending habits mean this product doesn’t fit easily into my monthly income. Plus, I'm not convinced it's a necessity given my lifestyle.
  
- **Try (2)**: There’s some curiosity about the effectiveness but not enough to justify trying it out without more compelling reasons or discounts.

- **Consider (1.5)**: While the idea of better energy and appearance isn't entirely dismissed, overall skepticism prevents serious consideration for purchase at current prices and marketing presentation.

In summary, I appreciate the ad's messaging but find it insufficiently aligned with my values, budget constraints, and personal disposition towards products that offer such promises without substantive evidence or cost-effectiveness. Thus, low scores reflect a cautious and reserved approach to both liking the ad and making any purchase decision.
