**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) - Given my reserved nature and lack of strong interest in flashy promotions, I am indifferent.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Disagree (3) – It seems too generic for me to find engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Disagree (2) – The claim feels overreaching without concrete evidence or personal relevance.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (3) – As someone who prefers more practical and straightforward messaging, it doesn't appeal.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (1) - The energetic claim is not compelling enough given my current lifestyle and budget priorities.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Disagree (2) – No immediate motivation or trust in the advertised benefits.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree (2) – While open to new options, there's no urgent need or attraction driving consideration.

Overall, while not entirely dismissive of health and energy drinks, my reserved nature, skepticism towards general claims, and practical focus make me unlikely to be swayed by this ad. Practicality and trustworthiness in offerings are key factors for a purchase decision.
