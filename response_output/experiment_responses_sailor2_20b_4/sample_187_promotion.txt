**Detailed Evaluation:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad (4/7):** While I appreciate its focus on energy and appearance, it feels a bit too generic for my personal tastes.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (3/7):** The message itself isn't particularly innovative or engaging given my experiences with similar products; hence, only moderately interesting.
3. **I believe the ad is good (5/7):** As an individual who values thoroughness and planning, I acknowledge its potential benefits but find it lacks depth to fully resonate.
4. **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** The aesthetic appeal isn't strong enough for me, given my practical outlook.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):** While I appreciate staying energized and looking good, there are other priorities with a limited income.
2. **I will try to buy this product (1/7):** There's no immediate drive or urgency to test it; budget constraints make trying it less likely.
3. **I will consider buying this product (3/7):** Given my originality and active imagination, I may give it some thought if a special offer arises or aligns with specific needs.

Overall, the advertisement holds mild interest but does not strongly influence my immediate purchase decision due to practical considerations and personal budget limitations.
