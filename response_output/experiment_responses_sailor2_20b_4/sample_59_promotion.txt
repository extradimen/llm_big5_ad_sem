**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** Score 4 (Agree)
   - The energy-boosting claim resonates with my day-to-day work life, but it doesn't make me enthusiastic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score 5 (Slightly Agree)
   - It presents an appealing value proposition for managing stress and maintaining appearance, which sparks mild interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score 6 (Strongly Agree)
   - I find it credible because it addresses common needs—staying energized and looking presentable—which aligns with my self-care priorities despite being reserved about promises.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score 3 (Neutral to Disagree)
   - The messaging is somewhat generic; while useful, its presentation doesn't strongly draw me in visually or emotionally due to a preference for more detailed and targeted information.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Score 2 (Disagree)
   - Despite the good message, there's no immediate drive since other routine habits already fulfill similar needs.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Score 4 (Neutral leaning toward Agree)
   - It might be worth a trial if available in stores or online with favorable reviews from trusted sources.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Score 3 (Agree)
   - Overall, I'm open to considering it for future use as an alternative option when current methods start showing diminishing returns or if it's recommended by peers.

In summary, the ad effectively communicates benefits but doesn't evoke strong emotional engagement due to my reserved nature and existing routines. While not immediately compelling me to buy, there is a modicum of interest leading towards possible trial and future consideration.
