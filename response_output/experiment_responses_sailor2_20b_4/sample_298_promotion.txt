**Evaluation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - *I like the ad:* Neutral (5): While I appreciate energy drinks for their practical benefits, the ad doesn’t strongly resonate with my personal preferences or lifestyle. It feels somewhat generic.
  - *Interesting*: Agree-ish (4): The concept of staying energized is appealing; however, it lacks uniqueness and creativity to grab my attention fully.
  - *Good:* Disagree (3): While functional claims are standard in this category, the ad appears too straightforward without compelling evidence or emotional connection.
  - *Attractive:* Strongly Disagree (2): The visual appeal or messaging doesn’t align with my values—too much focus on appearance isn't motivating.

- **Purchase Intentions:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: Agree-ish (4): Given its usefulness, I might buy the product but not due to this ad alone.
  - *Try:* Neutral leaning Disagree (2): There's hesitation because other factors like reviews and personal experience carry more weight than a generic promotion.
  - *Consider buying:* Disagree (1): The ad doesn't sway my decision; further details or genuine experiences would be needed before considering purchase.

Overall, while energy drinks have practical value for me as an employee managing multiple tasks, the advertisement misses opportunities to engage with someone who values thoroughness but prefers a more thoughtful approach and less surface-level promises. Thus, low scores on attractiveness and intent reflect this evaluation.
