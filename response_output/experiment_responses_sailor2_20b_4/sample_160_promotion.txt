**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* - Neutral (3): While it’s straightforward, my reserved nature means I don’t feel a strong emotional connection to promotional ads.
  - *Interesting.* - Agree (4): The promise of energy and looking good appeals mildly as someone who values efficiency in daily tasks.
  - *Good.* - Strongly Agree (5): Personally find the message credible; health-conscious individuals, including blue-collar workers, often seek products that enhance productivity and appearance.
  - *Attractive.* - Disagree (2): The promotional tone feels too generic for my taste. As someone with a reserved personality, I prefer more genuine or unique advertising.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* - Strongly Disagree (1): Despite the appeal of staying energized and looking good, personal financial priorities and budget constraints outweigh this impulse.
  - *Will try to buy this product.* - Neutral (3): There's a mild curiosity but not enough motivation given other commitments and expenses.
  - *Consider buying this product.* - Agree (4): In theory, the benefits align with my work-life balance goals. While I might consider it when faced with lower-cost alternatives or special offers.

Overall, while the ad is effective in conveying its message, practical considerations (budget, preference for more genuine ads) temper any immediate purchase intent. It's a product worth considering but not an urgent priority.
