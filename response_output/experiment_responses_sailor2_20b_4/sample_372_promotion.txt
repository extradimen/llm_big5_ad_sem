**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3) - While I appreciate that it's trying to promote energy and appearance benefits, my strong tendency towards being talkative and outgoing doesn't resonate deeply with a generic wellness message.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 2) - The concept lacks personal appeal for someone who values originality but finds the premise slightly clich√©.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4) - It's neutral, as I see its potential benefits yet don't find it convincing enough to inspire strong belief given my skepticism and tendency towards caring more about tangible results rather than marketing claims alone.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 3) - While visually or emotionally engaging is not particularly low, neither does it strongly grab my attention due to a mix of realism concerns and general trust issues.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 5) - There's an inclination towards giving new products a chance, especially those promising daily benefits that align with being active and energetic.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 6) - Given my tendency for carelessness but interest in trying unique ideas, I'm likely to make the effort if it seems reasonably priced and convenient.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 7) - Considering multiple factors including originality appeal, potential value, and a desire for new solutions, there's a strong overall consideration despite minor reservations about generic ads.

In summary, while my attitude toward the ad is neutral to slightly positive, my purchase intention leans significantly towards considering and trying out the product due to its alignment with my preference for innovation.
