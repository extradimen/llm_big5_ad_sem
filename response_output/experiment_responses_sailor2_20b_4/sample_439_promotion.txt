**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **1. I like the ad**: Scored a **5** because while not strongly disliked, it doesn't resonate deeply due to personal preference for subtler messaging.
    - **2. I think the ad is interesting**: Rated a **6**, finding it reasonably engaging with its promise of energy and appearance improvement.
    - **3. I believe the ad is good**: Scored a solid **7** as the claims are straightforward, making it seem credible given my generally trusting nature (Agree).
    - **4. I find the ad attractive**: Rated slightly lower at **4**, since while visually appealing, its overt focus on looks aligns less with my priorities and values.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **1. I intend to purchase this product**: Given moderate interest but personal financial constraints (my income range), it's a **2**.
    - **2. I will try to buy this product**: While the appeal is there, it falls short of motivating immediate action, hence a score of **3** for trying.
    - **3. I will consider buying this product**: Even if I'm not enthusiastic about purchasing right away (due to cost and personal prioritization), the ad does prompt some consideration with its compelling benefits; thus, rated as **2**.

Overall, while appreciating the straightforward messaging and trustworthiness of the claims, practical considerations like budget constraints limit my strong intention to buy.
