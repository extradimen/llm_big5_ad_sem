**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - Neutral but slightly negative.
   Given my reserved nature (`Strongly Agree`), I don't find it particularly engaging or appealing.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - Somewhat agreeable.
   The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, making it somewhat attention-grabbing.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 2)** - Disagree.
   While relevant to daily fatigue, I find it slightly manipulative in its urgency, which isn't trustworthy (`Strongly Disagree`).

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Neutral leaning negative.
   The imagery and messaging seem standard rather than compelling for someone who values authenticity.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree.
   My budget concerns (`Monthly income range`) make such purchases less likely without a strong personal appeal or significant need.

2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - Strongly disagree.
   There's no immediate motivation, and my cautious nature (`Strongly Agree` reserved) prevents spontaneous decisions.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - Somewhat consider it.
   Despite reservations, if the drink seems genuinely beneficial to energy levels or comes with good reviews from trustworthy sources, I might give it a thought in the future when budget allows.

In summary, while I see some relatable aspects of the ad, my reserved and cautious nature significantly reduces its appeal. The purchase intention is low due to financial constraints and lack of immediate trust in quick-fix solutions.
