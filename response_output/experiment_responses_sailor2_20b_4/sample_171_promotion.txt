**Evaluation Breakdown:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 5)** - I appreciate its positive messaging about energy and appearance but it doesn't excite me greatly.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4)** - It's engaging enough, highlighting benefits relevant to maintaining daily performance.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 6)** - It conveys a clear value proposition that aligns with staying active and looking presentableâ€”key aspects for an office worker like me.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - While functional, it lacks visual or emotional appeal to strongly attract my attention.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - The benefits are appealing, but I need more information about specific ingredients and long-term effectiveness.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - My generally cautious nature makes me hesitant without direct experience or reviews from peers.
3. **I will consider buying it (Score: 2)** - While not immediately compelling, the idea of improving energy levels is worth considering for my daily routine.

Overall, while I appreciate its message and find aspects relevant, additional details about efficacy and user experiences would elevate both attitude towards the ad and purchase intention significantly.
