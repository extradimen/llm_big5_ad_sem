**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (score: 4)**: The advertisement's concept is okay but it doesn't particularly excite me due to my reserved nature.
   - **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)**: While not uninteresting, I find it standard and less engaging given my preference for originality.
   - **I believe the ad is good (score: 4)**: It's well-made but lacks that strong emotional connection I look for in promotions. Credibility seems adequate.
   - **I find the ad attractive (score: 2)**: My reserved personality means it doesn't draw me in visually or emotionally; more subdued ads appeal less to me.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **I intend to purchase this product (score: 5)**: The benefits of staying energized and looking good are appealing, but my cautious nature makes a firm commitment low.
   - **I will try to buy this product (score: 6)**: Given its positive claims and moderate interest, I'm inclined to give it a chance once available.
   - **I will consider buying the product (score: 7)**: The idea resonates with my need for balance between work duties and personal well-being, making it highly worthy of consideration.

Overall, while the advertisement is decently appealing but not overwhelming due to my reserved personality traits, I am motivated enough by its promises to seriously contemplate purchasing the drink.
