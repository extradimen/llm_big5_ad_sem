**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - *I like the ad*: Neutral-to-moderately positive (score of 4): Given my Strongly Agree to being original and having new ideas, I appreciate creative concepts but find this particular claim somewhat generic.
  - *Interesting*: Somewhat neutral-positive (3): It's not groundbreaking for me as an energy drink user; needs more innovation or personal relevance.
  - *Believe it is good*: Mild positive (5): While generally trusting and helpful, the promise of "looking your best" seems a bit over-ambitious without concrete evidence.
  - *Attractive*: Slightly negative-to-neutral (2): The focus on external appearance doesn't resonate strongly with my priorities or daily life.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - *Intend to purchase this product*: Low intention (1): Despite being open-minded, the ad's claims donâ€™t convince me enough for a strong buy decision.
  - *Will try to buy it*: Mild interest (2): Might consider giving it a shot out of curiosity or when exploring new brands but not immediately compelling.
  - *Consider buying this product*: Moderate consideration (3): It sits on my list as an option, especially if offered during sales or with discounts.

Overall, the ad makes moderate impressions without fully engaging me due to its generic appeal and lack of specific benefits tailored to my needs. I remain open but cautious about making a purchase based solely on this promotion.
