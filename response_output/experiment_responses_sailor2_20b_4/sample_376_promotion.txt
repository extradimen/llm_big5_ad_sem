**Evaluation Details:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (score: 3)
   - While I appreciate its attempt to present an energetic and appealing image, it feels somewhat generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (score: 4)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates with daily life challenges but doesnâ€™t spark significant interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral leaning Positive (score: 5)
   - It's well-intentioned, aiming to improve physical appearance and energy levels, which are important aspects for anyone in my demographic.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Disagree (score: 2)
   - Lacks personal appeal; too general to resonate deeply with someone cautious like me.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (score: 1)
   - Despite its claims, my budget constraints and preference for proven products over marketing hype make a direct purchase unlikely.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (score: 1)
   - Given limited financial resources (<15,000,000 VND/month), trying new beverages is not a priority or financially feasible.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Neutral leaning Toward Consideration (score: 3)
   - Though unlikely to buy immediately due to budget and skepticism, I'm open to considering it if recommended by trusted sources or during special offers.

In summary, while the advertisement touches on aspects that are important to me, its broad appeal does not strongly drive my purchase intent. Cost-effectiveness and personal reliability remain critical factors in decision-making for someone with my background.
