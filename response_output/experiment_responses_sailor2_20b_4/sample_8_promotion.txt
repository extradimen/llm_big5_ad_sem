**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (4): The phrase is generic and appealing to a broad audience but doesn't resonate deeply.
  - I think the ad is interesting (5): It's mildly engaging due to its promise of energy and good looks, especially relevant for someone in their late twenties balancing life post-divorce.
  - I believe the ad is good (3): The claim seems credible on paper, though not exceptionally compelling given my neutral feelings toward unselfishness and general trust.
  - I find the ad attractive (2): While visually appealing ads can work, this one lacks emotional depth for me.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (1): Despite liking aspects of it, there's no strong pull or urgency given my busy lifestyle preferences and lack of prior experience with similar products.
  - I will try to buy this product (2): Mild curiosity, but not enough to actively seek out the product immediately.
  - I will consider buying this product (3): It aligns somewhat with my goals for daily energy and appearance, so it's worth considering if other factors (like pricing or reviews) align.

Overall, while there is some appeal in its messaging, the ad needs more personal connection to drive a stronger purchase intent.
