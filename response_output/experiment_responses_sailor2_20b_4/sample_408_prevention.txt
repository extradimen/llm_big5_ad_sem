**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad**: Neutral (score of 3) — The claim seems straightforward but doesn't strongly engage me.
2. **Interesting**: Disagree slightly (score of 2) — While it addresses a common issue, the message lacks novelty or creativity to stand out.
3. **Good quality**: Agree moderately (score of 4) — It conveys an essential benefit clearly and logically, making it credible on some level.
4. **Attractive**: Strongly Disagree (score of 1) — The presentation doesn't appeal personally; it feels somewhat generic.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product**: Low intention (2/7) — I might consider it but am not driven by the ad alone.
2. **Try to buy this product**: Moderately interested in trying (3/7) — The fatigue and dullness angle resonates, prompting curiosity but no urgency.
3. **Consider buying the product**: Slightly considering (2/7) — While I acknowledge its potential benefit, my current habits or other priorities may take precedence.

Overall, while recognizing the functional value of the drink, the ad does not strongly captivate me due to a lack of personal appeal and emotional connection. The scores reflect this balanced mix of credibility and lukewarm engagement.
