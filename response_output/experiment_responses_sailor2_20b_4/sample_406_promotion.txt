**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **I like the ad (Score: 4)**:
     I appreciate its upbeat message about energy and appearance but find it slightly over-idealized.
   - **Interesting (Score: 5)**:
     The idea of staying energized resonates, making it engaging to some extent.
   - **Good (Score: 6)**:
     It effectively communicates benefits, though it seems more geared towards younger demographics rather than my age group.
   - **Attractive (Score: 3)**:
     While visually appealing and professional-looking, the overall tone is a bit detached from my personal needs as a civil servant.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
     Though I value energy drinks for work, it lacks specific details tailored to middle-aged users or my health concerns.
   - **Try to buy the product (Score: 3)**:
     If conveniently available and priced reasonably, I might give it a shot due to curiosity about its claimed benefits.
   - **Consider buying this product (Score: 4)**:
     The balanced score reflects that while not an immediate priority, potential health improvements could sway me towards considering the purchase.

In summary, my strong sociability and talkativeness make me open to such ads but practical considerations like relevance and personalized information influence lower purchase intentions. The ad is somewhat effective in attracting attention yet needs adjustments for a more mature consumer base.
