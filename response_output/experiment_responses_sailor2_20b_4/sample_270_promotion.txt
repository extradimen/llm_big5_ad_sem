**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    - **Like (score = 4)**: Neutral to positive. The ad is pleasant but doesn't strongly catch my attention.
    - **Interesting (score = 3)**: Somewhat engaging; the promise of energy and looking good piques mild interest.
    - **Good (score = 5)**: Slightly higher confidence due to trust in advertised benefits, aligning with "I do a thorough job."
    - **Attractive (score = 2)**: Minimal attractiveness as it's generic without personal appeal.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    - **Intend (score = 1)**: Strongly disagree. My cautious nature and sometimes careless habits mean I'm unlikely to commit impulsively.
    - **Try (score = 2)**: Mild curiosity, but not a strong push to buy immediately due to mixed reliability perception.
    - **Consider (score = 3)**: Open to thinking about it; practical benefits align with my values of thoroughness and self-care, though I need more assurance.

Overall, while there's potential interest in the product based on its claims, personal traits like cautiousness and emotional stability result in a low likelihood of immediate purchase. A bit more detail or targeted reassurance could sway me further.
