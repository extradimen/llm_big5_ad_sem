**Evaluation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad (3):** Neutral leaning towards slight disapproval due to its straightforwardness and somewhat manipulative tone.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (4):** Agreeable; it piques curiosity but lacks originality or creativity in presentation.
3. **I believe the ad is good (5):** Somewhat positive, acknowledging clarity on benefits yet missing compelling emotional connection.
4. **I find the ad attractive (2):** Disagreeing slightly; feels more utilitarian than engaging and fails to evoke strong interest.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (4):** Neutral with a lean towards consideration; health benefits are acknowledged, but no immediate impulse.
2. **I will try to buy this product (3):** Possibly low due to the ad's limited appeal and my cautious approach when it comes to new products.
3. **I will consider buying this product (4):** Balanced between careful evaluation and potential benefit recognition.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively communicates its preventive message and benefits, its lack of emotional depth and creativity reduces its overall attractiveness for me as a consumer with strong sociability but high caution and occasional skepticism towards advertisements. Although it does not strongly push me away, it doesn't inspire immediate action either, resulting in moderate scores across both attitude and intention metrics.
