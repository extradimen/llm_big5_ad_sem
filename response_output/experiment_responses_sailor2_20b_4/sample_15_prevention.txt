**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **I like the ad. (Score = 3)**: It's okay but not particularly appealing.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (Score = 4)**: There’s a slight intrigue due to its relevance to energy levels, though it doesn't captivate me much.
- **I believe the ad is good. (Score = 5)**: The message conveys potential benefits but lacks compelling evidence or creativity for strong endorsement.
- **I find the ad attractive. (Score = 2)**: I am not drawn visually nor emotionally by this advertisement.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (Score = 1)**: Strongly disagree; personal habits and budget considerations outweigh perceived benefits at present.
- **I will try to buy this product. (Score = 2)**: Mild inclination, but not enough motivation from the ad alone.
- **I will consider buying this product. (Score = 3)**: Open-minded consideration based on potential future needs or if other factors align.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance and potentially good content, my cautious nature and existing lifestyle don't make me immediately receptive to purchasing a new energy drink purely from this ad’s appeal.
