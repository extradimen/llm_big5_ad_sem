**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3): The claim of staying energized resonates slightly but lacks a personal connection.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4): Itâ€™s somewhat engaging, considering its straightforward benefits. 
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5): Neutral to positive on credibility; it presents tangible results but could be more compelling.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2): Minimal visual appeal or emotional connection for me as a reserved, practical individual.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 1): Low intent due to lack of strong motivation or personal relevance.
  - *Will try to buy this product.* (Score: 1): No immediate desire; other priorities take precedence for a student with my responsibilities and income level.
  - *Will consider buying the product.* (Score: 2): A very cautious approach, as I am thorough but not convinced enough by an ad alone. Further research would be required.

Overall, while the message is clear and somewhat appealing, it doesn't sufficiently align with my reserved nature or current priorities to elicit a strong purchase intention.
