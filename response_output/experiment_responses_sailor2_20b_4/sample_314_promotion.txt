**Evaluation Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - *I like the ad:* **3 (Neutral)** – Although I appreciate its intent to energize and improve appearance, it doesn't particularly resonate with my personal preferences or lifestyle.
  - *Interesting:* **4 (Slightly Agree)** – The promise of looking good every day might intrigue me a bit but not enough to be captivated fully.
  - *Good:* **5 (Agree)** – It seems credible and aligns with general wellness goals, so I find it positively acceptable.
  - *Attractive:* **2 (Disagree)** – Given my reserved nature and the neutral stance on originality or creativity, the ad's aesthetic appeal does not strongly draw me in.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase:* **1 (Strongly Disagree)** – My monthly income is limited (<15,000,000 VND), and this expenditure seems unnecessary without a clear necessity.
  - *Try to buy:* **1 (Strongly Disagree)** – Similarly, despite being detail-oriented in my job responsibilities, I lack motivation or urgency to try the product.
  - *Consider buying:* **2 (Slightly Agree)** – Even though it doesn't strongly align with immediate needs, there’s a mild curiosity about its effectiveness if time and budget permit.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential benefits, this ad falls short of compelling me due to my reserved personality, financial constraints, and moderate interest in wellness products.
