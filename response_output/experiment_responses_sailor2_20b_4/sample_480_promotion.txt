**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score: 2)  
   - Given my reserved nature and tendency to be neutral in social settings, I don't find this energetic, flashy advertisement particularly appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 3)  
   - It's mildly intriguing but lacks personal relevance for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 4)  
   - The claims about staying energized and looking your best are positive, so I don't find them outright unappealing; just neutral at best.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 3)  
   - While not very visually appealing or emotionally engaging to me due to my preference for a more reserved approach, it doesn’t repulse either.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 2)  
   - With limited income (<15 million VND/month), I'm cautious about splurging on non-essentials, making the intention low despite its benefits.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 1)  
   - Given my financial constraints and lack of immediate need for such a supplement, there's little motivation to actively seek it out or prioritize buying now.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3)  
   - In the future, if circumstances change or if I find myself needing extra energy without compromising budget priorities, consideration might rise; however, as of now, it’s a low-priority item.

Overall, while the ad isn’t entirely unattractive and the benefits sound positive, my reserved nature, financial limitations, and current lack of urgency mean both attitude scores and purchase intentions remain moderate to low.
