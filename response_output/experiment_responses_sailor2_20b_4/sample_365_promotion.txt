**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad:* Neutral (3). As a reserved person, while not strongly negative, it doesn’t immediately resonate.
  - *Interesting:* Agree (4). The concept of staying energized and looking good piques curiosity due to my Strongly Agree tendency for an active imagination.
  - *Good:* Disagree (2). Given the lack of originality in typical marketing claims and my skepticism toward exaggerated promises, I don’t find it convincing enough.
  - *Attractive:* Neutral (3). The ad’s design might be acceptable but not compelling given personal preferences.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase:* Strongly Disagree (1). Despite being interested in the idea, my cautious nature and thorough approach mean I need more concrete evidence before committing.
  - *Try to buy:* Neutral (3). While intrigued, there’s no strong urge or immediate plan without additional reassurance or personal experience.
  - *Consider buying:* Disagree (2). The ad influences awareness but doesn’t drive a decision due to my preference for cautious consideration over impulsive purchases. 

Overall, the ad sparks curiosity and imagination but falls short in convincing me to make an actual purchase based on its general appeal rather than compelling specifics or trustworthiness.
