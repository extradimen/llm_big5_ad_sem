**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3)**: I find the ad acceptable but not particularly appealing due to my reserved nature and dislike of overt marketing claims.
   - **Interesting (4)**: It piques some interest because it directly addresses feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable concerns for an office worker. However, it's a bit generic.
   - **Good (5)**: The ad is well-executed in terms of messaging but doesn't strongly resonate with my personal values or lifestyle.
   - **Attractive (2)**: While I acknowledge its potential benefits, the directness feels slightly manipulative to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (1)**: Given my strong tendency towards thoroughness and practicality but also carelessness in planning, the ad isn't sufficient for a firm purchase intent.
   - **Try (2)**: I might give it a try due to curiosity about its potential effects on energy levels and appearance, but it wonâ€™t be an immediate decision.
   - **Consider (3)**: While not compelling enough to buy right away, it would factor into my future considerations if other aspects align with my needs.

In summary, the ad holds moderate appeal while being pragmatic in intent. However, strong personal attributes like caution and reserve mean a higher level of conviction is required before making a purchase decision.
