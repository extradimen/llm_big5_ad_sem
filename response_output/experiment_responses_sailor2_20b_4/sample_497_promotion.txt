**Explanation:**

### **Attitudinal Response to the Ad**
1. **I like the ad:** Agree (Score = 4): As a generally talkative and outgoing person, I appreciate energetic advertisements that promise daily benefits.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Strongly Agree (Score = 5): The idea of staying energized appeals to me; however, it doesn't capture my imagination strongly enough given my preference for practicality over high excitement.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral/Disagree (Score = 3): While I appreciate its goal, there's a lack of specific details or evidence that makes it compelling on an everyday basis with limited income constraints and other priorities.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Agree (Score = 2): The visual aesthetics might be appealing but fail to significantly impact my immediate buying decision.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) - Given my financial situation (<15,000,000 VND/month), I need budgeted essentials over luxury or perceived self-improvement products.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Agree/Neutral (Score = 2): Though the idea is interesting, it wonâ€™t drive an urgent purchase intent due to affordability and daily resource management concerns.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Disagree/Agree (Score = 3): The ad prompts some mild consideration but doesn't push me towards a serious commitment without more concrete benefits or discounts.

Overall, the advertisement is somewhat appealing for its energetic promise but falls short in terms of compelling purchase intent due to financial constraints and practicality. I might consider it under favorable circumstances but am not likely to prioritize buying immediately.
