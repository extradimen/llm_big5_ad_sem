**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement (Ad Attitude Scores):**
    - **I like the ad:** Score 2 (`Disagree`)
        - Given my reserved and not talkative nature, I don't find flashy ads particularly appealing.
    - **I think the ad is interesting:** Score 3 (`Neutral to Slightly Agree`)
        - The promise of staying energized resonates somewhat but falls short for immediate engagement.
    - **I believe the ad is good:** Score 4 (`Slightly Agree`)
        - It's well-intentioned, aiming at health and appearance benefits which can be relevant in daily life.
    - **I find the ad attractive:** Score 1 (`Strongly Disagree`)
        - Lack of visual appeal or personal connection means it fails to capture my interest.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product:** Score 2 (`Disagree`)
        - With limited income and existing budget constraints, I am cautious about new expenditures.
    - **I will try to buy this product:** Score 3 (`Neutral but leaning towards Try`)
        - It's worth considering if affordable or on sale, especially with my preference for health benefits.
    - **I will consider buying this product:** Score 4 (`Agree`)
        - Given the potential positive impact and manageable cost range, I might evaluate further before making a purchase.

Overall, while I don't strongly connect to the ad's presentation, its core message about energy and wellness aligns with some of my values. The low income makes me cautious but open-minded to consider it under favorable conditions.
