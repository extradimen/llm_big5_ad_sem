**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad (2):**
   - Given my reserved nature and tendency towards being emotionally stable but slightly anxious, I find it neutral at best. The energetic aspect feels out of sync with my personality.
  
- **I think the ad is interesting (3):** 
   - It has some appeal due to its promise of energy boost, which might be useful during long work hours as a civil servant, though not enough to strongly engage me.

- **I believe the ad is good (3):**
   - While I value health and well-being, it's neutral because I'm skeptical without more credible evidence or personal experience with similar products.
   
- **I find the ad attractive (4):** 
   - Marginally higher interest due to needing daily energy but not highly drawn by its aesthetics or messaging.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product (2):**
   - Low intention despite potential benefits; my cautious nature and lack of immediate need weigh against buying impulsively.
   
- **I will try to buy this product (1):** 
   - Strongly disagree. My careful approach and concern for financial resources prevent me from trying out new, potentially expensive products without more compelling reasons.

- **I will consider buying the product (2):**
   - Slightly higher than "intend," but still low; I might ponder if it's affordable and aligns with my routine after further research or discounts.

Overall, while acknowledging potential benefits for energy levels, this advertisement does not strongly resonate due to my reserved personality, skepticism about promises without evidence, and practical financial considerations. The scores reflect a neutral-to-low interest in both the ad itself and purchasing intent.
