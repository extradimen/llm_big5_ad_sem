**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *I like the ad.* (Score = 2): Neutral to slightly negative; it's not particularly appealing given my reserved and unenthusiastic nature.
  - *Interesting:* (Score = 3): Mildly agree, as prevention ads generally have a purpose but don't captivate me deeply due to minimal trust and engagement inclination.
  - *Good:* (Score = 2): Neutral; while it conveys utility, the lack of thoroughness and emotional stability makes me skeptical about its quality.
  - *Attractive:* (Score = 4): Somewhat agree; visually or conceptually appealing but not enough to draw strong interest.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Score = 1): Strongly disagree. My reserved nature and tendency towards being careless mean I am unlikely to actively seek the product.
  - *Will try to buy this product.* (Score = 2): Disagree; minimal motivation, combined with practical skepticism about needing it frequently.
  - *Consider buying this product.* (Score = 3): Agree. Despite reservations, some awareness of fatigue and appearance issues might lead me to consider the purchase at times.

Overall, while not highly persuaded by the ad's message, there is a cautious acknowledgment that I may still evaluate its benefits in specific situations due to my helpfulness towards self-care despite being generally reserved about proactive health measures.
