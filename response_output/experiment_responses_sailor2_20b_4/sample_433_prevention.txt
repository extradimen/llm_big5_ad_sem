}

**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad (score = 4):** Neutral to slightly positive; while I appreciate its message, it doesn't excite me.
  - **Interesting:** A score of 3 indicates that the advertisement is moderately interesting but not particularly captivating.
  - **Believe the ad is good (score = 2):** This reflects skepticism towards the overall quality and credibility. The claim seems a bit exaggerated for my preferences.
  - **Attractive:** With a score of 5, I find it somewhat attractive visually or conceptually due to its clear message about fatigue prevention.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **Intend to purchase (score = 2):** Strongly disagree; the ad doesn't convince me enough to plan an immediate buy.
  - **Try to buy:** A score of 3 suggests openness but not strong motivation. It might be worth a try if there's another factor like discounts or reviews influencing my decision.
  - **Consider buying (score = 4):** Neutral leaning towards agree; the product idea aligns with potential benefits, so I'm open to considering it in future purchases.

Overall, while the ad has elements that are acceptable and somewhat appealing, they fall short of driving a strong purchasing impulse due to my tendency for thoroughness, trust issues (although generally trusting), and practicality. The balance remains cautious rather than enthusiastic.
