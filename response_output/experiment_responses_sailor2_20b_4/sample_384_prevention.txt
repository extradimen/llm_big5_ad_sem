**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like**: While not strongly drawn to the ad (score of 2), it doesn't turn me off either.
2. **Interesting**: Neutral but slightly engaging; a score of 3.
3. **Good**: I find some credibility in its claim about energy and appearance, rating it as 4/7.
4. **Attractive**: Slightly attractive due to the clear message aimed at addressing fatigue (score: 5).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase** : Given my tendency towards trust and thoroughness (strongly agree), I'm leaning strongly towards trying this product, hence a score of 6.
2. **Will try**: The persuasive element is compelling enough for me to at least give it a chance; rated as 7.
3. **Consider buying**: While the ad resonates moderately, my cautious nature leads me to still consider factors like cost and personal need before making a decision (score: 6).

In summary:
- **Moderately** favorable towards the advertisement itself but not strongly influenced by its superficial elements alone.
- Strong inclination toward trying and considering purchasing based on trust in product claims and thorough evaluation.
