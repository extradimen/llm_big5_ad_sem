**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - **Like**: Neutral (4) – The ad might grab attention initially, but it doesn't deeply appeal.
  - **Interesting**: Disagree (3) – It seems generic and not particularly engaging given my reserved nature and sometimes nervous disposition.
  - **Good**: Strongly Disagree (2) – Lacks credibility due to its vague claims about energy and appearance without specific details or trust factors I value.
  - **Attractive**: Strongly Disagree (2) – The appeal is low because it doesn't resonate with my needs as a blue-collar worker, where practical benefits are more crucial than superficial appearances.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Strongly Disagree (1) – I am not motivated by the advertised benefits and prioritize functional products over aesthetic promises.
  - **Try to Buy**: Strongly Disagree (1) – Given my skepticism, there's no inclination to give it a try without concrete evidence or personal recommendations.
  - **Consider Buying**: Strongly Disagree (1) – Even though I appreciate helpfulness in others and originality, the overall ad lacks credibility for me to seriously consider purchasing.

In summary, while the advertisement might capture attention momentarily, my critical evaluation based on practical needs, trustworthiness, and emotional stability leads me to dismiss it as unconvincing. Hence, low scores across attitudes and purchase intentions reflect this perspective accurately.
