**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like* (2): The claim seems generic, making it less appealing for someone who values personal authenticity over quick fixes.
   - *Interesting* (4): Neutral; while health concerns are relevant, the ad lacks unique selling points or compelling imagery to grab attention.
   - *Good* (3): Disagree slightly. The message is straightforward but not particularly well-executed or convincing.
   - *Attractive* (3): Slightly negative; it doesn’t resonate personally due to its overused language and lack of emotional connection.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend* (2): Strongly Disagree. Despite acknowledging the potential benefit, my strong sense of thoroughness means I prefer products backed by solid evidence rather than vague claims.
   - *Try* (3): Neutral; I might be open to trying if it's inexpensive and easily accessible, given my budget constraints (<15 million VND).
   - *Consider* (4): Slightly Agree. Though the ad is not persuasive on its own, price, brand reputation, and convenience will play a significant role in my decision.

Overall, while there’s minimal appeal from this advertisement, practical aspects like cost-effectiveness and reliability are crucial drivers of purchase intent for someone with my background and personality traits.
