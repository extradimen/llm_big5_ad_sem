**Evaluation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (2)** - The ad's claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates at a basic level but feels somewhat overemphasized.
2. **Interesting (3)** - While I understand its intention to grab attention, it lacks originality or creative flair that would truly interest me.
3. **Good (4)** - It conveys a valid concern but falls short on emotional engagement and uniqueness. There are better ways to present preventive health benefits persuasively.
4. **Attractive (3)** - The message is straightforward but not particularly attractive; it's functional rather than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (5)** - I might consider the product because it addresses common fatigue and appearance concerns, even if my interest isn't high.
2. **Try (6)** - Given its potential to alleviate tiredness, I have a moderate desire to give it a try before committing fully.
3. **Consider (5)** - The ad's straightforward yet somewhat uninspired approach nudges me towards considering the product without strong enthusiasm.

Overall, while not strongly persuaded by the advertisement itself, the practical benefits align with my lifestyle and needs enough for some level of interest and consideration in purchasing the drink.
