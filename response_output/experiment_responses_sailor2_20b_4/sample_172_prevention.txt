**Evaluation and Justification:**

**Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
1. **I like the ad (Score: 6)** - While the message is straightforward and addresses a common issue of feeling tired or looking dull, I find it somewhat compelling as someone who values productivity.
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5)** - The preventative approach appeals to my practical side but doesn't excite me too much.
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)** - It's effective in highlighting a problem and offering a solution, though it seems somewhat generic.
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 3)** - Attractive isn’t my strong suit here; I appreciate its functional appeal but am not drawn visually or emotionally by the advertisement.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)** - Though it resonates with addressing fatigue, my cautious nature and focus on budget mean that immediate purchase intention is low.
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1)** - There's minimal urgency or compelling evidence pushing me towards an active trial of the product.
3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 2)** - The concept aligns with my values of productivity and well-being, so it’s on the periphery of consideration but not a priority.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message, its impact is moderate due to personal preferences towards practicality over immediate excitement. My inclination leans more toward thoughtful deliberation before making a purchase decision.
