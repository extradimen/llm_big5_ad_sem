**Evaluation and Rationale:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like (2):** While not strongly disagreeing, my reserved nature makes me less likely to be drawn in by the ad's claims without concrete benefits.
  - **Interesting (3):** Neutral-to-disagree due to its generic appeal; I appreciate practicality over superficial promises. 
  - **Good (4):** Slightly positive because it aims for energy and appearance, relevant but needs more substance.
  - **Attractive (2):** Unimpressive visually as a reserved individual; the ad's design might not connect emotionally or meaningfully.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase (1):** Strongly disagree because my careful nature and low income make me skeptical of health/beauty products. 
  - **Try to Buy (2):** Slightly hesitant, leaning towards neutral; I might explore alternatives that match tighter budget constraints.
  - **Consider Buying (3):** Minimal interest due to the lack of compelling evidence or personal need outweighing perceived benefits.

Overall, while open to new ideas and originality, this ad does not align with my cautious lifestyle or financial situation. Thus, low scores reflect a critical but non-committal response.
