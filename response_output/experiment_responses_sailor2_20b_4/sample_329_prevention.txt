**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score of 3* - Neutral to slightly positive; it resonates with some aspects but not overwhelmingly.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score of 4* - Agreeably interesting due to its attention-grabbing warning about fatigue and appearance.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score of 5* - Generally agree that it presents a clear value proposition, though slightly guarded by my skepticism.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score of 2* - Not particularly visually or emotionally appealing due to personal preference for more engaging marketing styles.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score of 4 (Intend)* - There's a moderate intention based on perceived benefits, but it doesn't compel an immediate buy.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score of 3* - Somewhat inclined to give it a shot due to its focus on preventing tiredness and improving appearance.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score of 2 (Consider)* - Open for consideration, but other factors like budget constraints and past experiences also influence the decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's message and utility, personal preferences and current financial limitations lower my enthusiasm towards a purchase. The balance leans towards cautious interest rather than strong intent or immediate action.
