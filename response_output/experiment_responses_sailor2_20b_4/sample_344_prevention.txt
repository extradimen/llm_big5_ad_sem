**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad (2)*: Neutral to slightly disagree; given my reserved nature and tendency towards emotional instability, I don't find it particularly appealing.
  - *Interesting (3)*: Slightly agree; though not compelling enough due to lack of imagination or originality in ads.
  - *Good (4)*: Agree; it does convey a clear message about potential consequences without the drink.
  - *Attractive (1)*: Strongly disagree; my cautious and reserved personality makes me find this appeal lacking.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase*: 1 – I don't have strong intent, given my tendency towards carelessness and emotional instability.
  - *Will try to buy*: 2 – Slightly inclined due to recognizing the message but not enough motivation.
  - *Consider buying (3)*: Neutral; while it's on my radar, other factors like budget constraints (<15 million VND/month) make a purchase less likely.

Overall, the ad resonates somewhat intellectually with its preventive warning, yet lacks personal appeal and sufficient motivational drive for me to seriously consider purchasing.
