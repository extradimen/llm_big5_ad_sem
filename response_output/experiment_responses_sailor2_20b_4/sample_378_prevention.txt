   - **Attractive:** Agree (6) — It's visually appealing to me, making it seem more attractive than just informative.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral (3) — While not actively planning to buy immediately due to budget and priorities.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Disagree (4) — I’m less inclined to try this product impulsively, preferring more direct evidence of its effectiveness.

This evaluation reflects balancing realism with the product’s potential benefits within my lifestyle as a young civil servant. The ad resonates enough to be considered but does not drive immediate purchase intent due to personal habits and existing commitments.
