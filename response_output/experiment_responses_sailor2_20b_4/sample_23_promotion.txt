**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) — While not strongly drawn to the ad, its simplicity resonates with my conservative taste.
   - **Interesting:** Disagree slightly (2) — The claims seem generic rather than compelling for a blue-collar worker like me focusing on essentials over aesthetics.
   - **Good:** Agree mildly (4) — It conveys basic benefits but lacks specific appeal to my daily needs or concerns.
   - **Attractive:** Neutral (3) — Presentation is straightforward, neither striking nor distracting.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Somewhat Agree (5) — I'm open-minded and practical; the promise of energy boost could be useful but not a top priority.
   - **Try to Buy:** Strongly Agree slightly (6) — Given my helpful nature, trying it once might help support well-being or impress others subtly.
   - **Consider Buying:** Agree mildly (4) — While I don't reject it outright, the high price range compared to income makes me cautious; a thoughtful consideration fits within budget concerns.

Overall, while I appreciate the ad's intention and find parts of its message somewhat valuable, my reserved personality, combined with moderate financial constraints, leads to a balanced but positive evaluation. The product may be worth trying or considering for potential benefits rather than immediate purchase.
