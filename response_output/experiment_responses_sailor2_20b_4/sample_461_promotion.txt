**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (3)**: Neutral because it doesn't strongly appeal to my strong talkative nature or outgoing tendencies.
   - **Interesting (4)**: Slightly agree since staying energized is relevant, but not captivating enough given my preference for thoroughness and following plans.
   - **Good (2)**: Disagree due to skepticism about the claims; lack of trust in health/beauty promises without concrete evidence.
   - **Attractive (1)**: Strongly disagree as it feels generic and less compelling compared to other, more practical needs.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend (5)**: Agree because I recognize its potential benefits for maintaining energy levels, though not a priority right now.
   - **Try (6)**: Strongly agree due to my thorough approachâ€”wanting to test and evaluate the product before committing fully.
   - **Consider (7)**: Strongly agree; although emotionally stable isn't a strong suit, practicality aligns with evaluating its impact on daily life. 

Overall, while I appreciate a balanced evaluation of health benefits, the ad doesn't resonate deeply given my preferences but remains an option for consideration and possible future purchase.
