**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (score: 2)**:
   - Despite being outgoing and generally trusting, I'm strongly reserved and sometimes rude, so an overly aggressive or manipulative tone might not appeal to me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3)**:
   - While my active imagination draws some interest in creative ideas, this simple, somewhat clich√© message doesn't capture my attention fully.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score: 4)**:
   - It conveys a functional benefit but lacks compelling emotional or imaginative depth that resonates with me personally.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score: 2)**:
   - The direct approach feels utilitarian rather than appealing, especially given my reserved nature and preference for subtlety.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (score: 1)**:
   - My strong agreement with doing thorough jobs means I value quality, but the ad's persuasive technique falls short of convincing me without additional information or trust in the brand.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score: 1)**:
   - Given my financial constraints and lack of immediate appeal from the advertisement, trying it out isn't a priority.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score: 2)**:
   - There's an element of consideration based on its potential benefit in energy levels, but overall low interest means I'm unlikely to act upon it without stronger motivation or further exploration.

Overall, while acknowledging the functional message, my reserved and careful nature leads me to be generally unimpressed by this advertisement. Therefore, my purchase intention is minimal despite understanding its intended benefits.
