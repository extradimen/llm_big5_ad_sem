**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** Score 5 - Neutral with a slight lean towards liking it.
   - Being outgoing (Agree) means I appreciate engaging content but find the claim of "energized" & "best look every day" somewhat generic and not particularly compelling.

2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Score 4 - Slightly Disagree
   - While I enjoy variety, this energy drink's promise feels like a common wellness pitch without unique selling points that would intrigue me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Score 3 - Neutral with some skepticism.
   - As someone who values thoroughness (Strongly Agree), I need specific evidence or testimonials rather than broad claims to trust it fully.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** Score 2 - Strongly Disagree
   - The aesthetics might be visually appealing, but emotional appeal lacks depth for my cautious nature and personal interests in practical benefits over superficial appearances (Strongly Agree emotionally stable).

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** Score 1 - Strongly Disagree
   - Based on my financial constraints ($26M-35M VND/month), energy drinks are not a priority, especially without clear value or urgency.

2. **Will try to buy this product:** Score 2 - Neutral leaning towards not trying.
   - Given the cost and lack of compelling reasons (Strongly Agree on following through with plans), I am unlikely to make an unplanned purchase.

3. **Consider buying this product:** Score 3 - Slightly Consider
   - In exceptional circumstances, if my routine demands energy boosts or there's a solid discount/promotion tailored for blue-collar workers like myself, it could move me towards considering the purchase.

In summary, while not entirely dismissive of the ad due to its friendly tone (Agree on sociability), the overall score indicates moderate disinterest and low intention to buy. Practicality and specific benefits need better emphasis to appeal significantly.
