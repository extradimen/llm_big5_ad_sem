**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
1. **Like the ad (Score: 2)**  
   - While not strongly disagreeing, I don't find it particularly appealing due to a neutral-to-negative stance on sociability and emotional trust.
   
2. **Interesting (Score: 3)**  
   - The claim about staying energized is somewhat interesting but doesnâ€™t captivate me deeply given my age group preferences.

3. **Good ad (Score: 4)**  
   - It's serviceable, addressing health and appearance concerns with a standard message that meets baseline expectations without excelling.

4. **Attractive (Score: 3)**  
   - The visual or tone of the ad doesn't strongly attract me; it feels generic rather than compelling for someone in my demographic.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 1, Strongly Disagree)**  
   - Despite acknowledging its benefits, personal priorities and budget constraints make a direct intention unlikely.

2. **Try to buy the product (Score: 2, Neutral)**  
   - Open-minded but not driven by urgency; might consider sampling if available free-of-cost or with significant discounts.

3. **Consider buying (Score: 2, Agree)**  
   - The ad does leave me thinking about it as an option, especially in a context where energy and appearance are priorities for personal well-being, but the final decision remains tentative due to other factors like financial constraints and product credibility.

Overall, while not dismissive, my evaluation reflects cautious openness balanced with realistic considerations of lifestyle and resources. The ad resonates moderately without strong enough motivation for an immediate purchase.
