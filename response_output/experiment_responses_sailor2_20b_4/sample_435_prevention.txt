**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement (Scores):**
  - **I like the ad.**: Score of 2 — Given my reserved nature (`Agree`), I don't find it particularly appealing.
  - **I think the ad is interesting.**: Score of 3 — Neutral, doesn’t grab much attention but not entirely uninteresting.
  - **I believe the ad is good.**: Score of 4 — It's mildly persuasive due to my tendency towards emotional stability (`Agree`), yet I don't find it convincing enough for a strong endorsement.
  - **I find the ad attractive.**: Score of 1 — Strongly disagree, as the message feels more manipulative than genuine given my skepticism (`Strongly Disagree`) and carelessness (`Strongly Agree`).

- **Purchase Intention (Scores):**
  - **I intend to purchase this product.**: Score of 2 — Despite not being strongly influenced by ads, I might consider it if other factors align.
  - **I will try to buy this product.**: Score of 3 — Neutral; I’m open but cautious about trying new beverages due to financial constraints and personal habits.
  - **I will consider buying this product.**: Score of 4 — While not enthusiastic, the potential need for energy boost (given my job's physical demands) might make me consider it if offered at a reasonable price.

Overall, while I find the ad moderately persuasive but unappealing, my purchase intention is influenced by practicality and necessity rather than emotional appeal. The balance between skepticism and pragmatic needs results in moderate consideration without strong intent or immediate action.
