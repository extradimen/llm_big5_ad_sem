**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Neutral (3) - While not strongly against it, I find myself indifferent due to my reserved nature and lack of immediate attraction.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Agree (4) - The concept appeals as staying energized and looking good daily aligns with common aspirations.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Strongly Agree (5) - It seems well-crafted, presenting clear benefits in an appealing manner.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (2) - As a reserved individual, I don't feel drawn to its aesthetics or overall visual presentation.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly Disagree (1) - Given my modest monthly income and tendency towards thoroughness, immediate commitment without more information is unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Neutral (3) - Thereâ€™s potential interest but no strong pull; I need more details on pricing, effectiveness, etc., before making a decision.
3. **I will consider buying the product**: Agree (4) - The benefits are compelling enough that it remains in my consideration set, particularly if price aligns with affordability and reviews support its claims.

This balanced evaluation reflects both appreciation for the message while acknowledging practical constraints and personal preferences affecting purchase intent.
