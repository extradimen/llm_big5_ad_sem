### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like:** (Score: 6) - While not overly enthusiastic, I appreciate the direct approach targeting energy and vitality.
2. **Interesting:** (Score: 5) - The ad's message is clear but could benefit from more compelling visuals or storytelling to capture attention fully.
3. **Good:** (Score: 4) - It effectively conveys a need for this drink to combat tiredness, which resonates with my focus on health and productivity.
4. **Attractive:** (Score: 3) - The appeal is moderate; additional personalization or relatability could make it more engaging.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend:** (Score: 2) - While the message is clear, other factors like brand trust and price will heavily influence my final decision.
2. **Try:** (Score: 3) - I am open to giving it a try if presented with convincing testimonials or special offers that align with my budget constraints.
3. **Consider:** (Score: 4) - It definitely fits into my consideration set for maintaining energy levels, especially given its potential benefits.

Overall, the ad is persuasive enough to generate interest but falls short on emotional appeal and comprehensive engagement, leading me to be somewhat cautious about immediate purchase intent. The neutral-to-positive scores reflect a balanced view between curiosity and practicality in decision-making.
