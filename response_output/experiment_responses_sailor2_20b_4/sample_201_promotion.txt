**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores (1–7 Scale):**
    - **Like the Ad:** I have a neutral to slightly positive view due to its claim of staying energized and looking good, but it doesn't strongly appeal.
        - Score: 3
    - **Interesting:** The concept is basic; not particularly innovative given other similar products in the market.
        - Score: 2
    - **Believe the Ad is Good:** It conveys a positive message about self-care and appearance, which resonates with my values to some extent.
        - Score: 4
    - **Attractive:** The ad's presentation feels somewhat generic; not enough personal connection or uniqueness for me.
        - Score: 1

- **Purchase Intention Scores (1–7 Scale):**
    - **Intend to Purchase:** Though I have reservations, the idea of enhanced energy and appearance might sway my decision toward a trial.
        - Score: 5
    - **Will Try to Buy:** Given its alignment with maintaining daily well-being, I’m more inclined towards giving it a try once or regularly depending on reviews.
        - Score: 6
    - **Consider Buying:** Despite not being highly motivated by the ad itself, practical benefits and personal needs make me seriously consider purchasing this product.
        - Score: 7

In summary, while my initial perception of the advertisement isn't strongly positive (neutral to somewhat negative), I still find value in trying or potentially buying the product due to its functional promise. My cautious nature aligns well with a balanced consideration before making a purchase decision.
