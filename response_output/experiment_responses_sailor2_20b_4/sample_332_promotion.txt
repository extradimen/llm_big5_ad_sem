}

**Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 3) - While not strongly opposed, I find it neutral because the promise of energy and looking good doesn't particularly excite me.
2. **Interesting:** (Score = 2) - The claims are generic and lack uniqueness to pique my interest.
3. **Good Advertisement:** (Score = 4) - It conveys a clear benefit but lacks emotional appeal or distinctive features that make it stand out.
4. **Attractive:** (Score = 3) - Slightly more engaging than unattractive, yet not persuasive enough given my reserved and somewhat nervous nature.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 1) - Strongly disagree; the ad doesn't resonate with me.
2. **Try to buy it:** (Score = 1) - I'm unlikely to take an initiative based on this advertisement alone due to lack of compelling reasons or personal need.
3. **Consider buying it:** (Score = 2) - Neutral, might consider if there's additional information or a specific incentive but not driven by the ad itself.

Overall, while acknowledging its functional promises, the advertisement doesn't align with my reserved and cautious personality traits, leading to low intent to purchase despite neutral attractiveness.
