**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**: 
  - **I like the ad (score 5)**: While I appreciate its message about energy and looking good, it's not particularly exciting given my reserved personality.
  - **Interesting (score 4)**: The concept is engaging for a bit but doesn't captivate me fully due to my preference for practical over flashy claims.
  - **Good (score 6)**: It seems well-intentioned and beneficial if true, aligning with my general trustfulness.
  - **Attractive (score 3)**: Lacks the visual or emotional draw necessary given that I get nervous easily and prefer more stable endorsements.

- **Purchase Intention**:
  - **Intend to purchase**: A moderate score of 2. While it's an interesting concept, my cautious nature means I'm not ready for immediate action.
  - **Try to buy (1.5)**: Slightly lower as the ad lacks a compelling reason or personal urgency to commit financially right now.
  - **Consider buying**: A score of 2 indicates that I'll keep it in mind and may consider trying if reviews, recommendations from trusted sources, or further reassurance are provided.

Overall, though not strongly persuaded by the advertisement, there's room for mild interest and potential future consideration based on additional factors.
