**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score: 3)**: The ad is somewhat appealing but doesn't strongly resonate with me given my reserved nature and preference for practicality over appearance.
  - **Interesting (Score: 2)**: It's not particularly engaging because it leans too much on superficial benefits—energy and looks—which aren’t top priorities for someone like me who values substance over hype.
  - **Good (Score: 4)**: While the claims seem decent, they lack specific details or proof that would make them compelling. Thus, I find the overall presentation somewhat average rather than good.
  - **Attractive (Score: 1)**: Given my reserved and practical demeanor, this ad doesn't align with my values; hence, it feels unattractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Score of 2 indicates low likelihood due to the lack of compelling features for a blue-collar worker prioritizing health over beauty.
  - **Try Buying**: Similar to "intend," but slightly higher (score 2) because I might be open to trying it if there were stronger, practical endorsements or discounts.
  - **Consider Buying**: Score of 3 suggests that while the product isn’t immediately compelling, it could still enter my consideration for future needs or better promotional efforts. 

In summary, this ad doesn't strongly connect with me due to its focus on superficial benefits and lack of detailed credibility—leading to moderate interest but low intention to buy.
