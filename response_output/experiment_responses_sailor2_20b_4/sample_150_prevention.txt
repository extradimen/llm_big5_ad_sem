1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *Like (Score: 3)*: While not strongly negative, I find it mildly agreeable but not particularly engaging.
   - *Interesting (Score: 4)*: The ad is somewhat interesting; it grabs my attention with its focus on energy and appearance.
   - *Good (Score: 5)*: It conveys a clear message effectively, making me see the potential benefits in avoiding fatigue and dullness.
   - *Attractive (Score: 2)*: While informative, the ad lacks emotional appeal or an attractive presentation style for my preferences.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase (Score: 2)*: I’m not strongly motivated to buy this product based on the advertisement alone.
   - *Try to Buy (Score: 2)*: There’s a moderate level of curiosity, but it doesn’t drive me to seek out the drink immediately.
   - *Consider Buying (Score: 3)*: Given my practical nature and preference for thoroughness, I would consider this product if other factors align with my needs or lifestyle.

Overall, while the ad effectively communicates its message, it does not strongly resonate emotionally. My purchase intention is moderate due to a balance between curiosity about potential benefits and personal preferences that favor cautious decision-making.
