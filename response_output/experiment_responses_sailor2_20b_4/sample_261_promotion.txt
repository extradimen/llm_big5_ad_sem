}

**Explanation:**

- **Attitudinal Scores:**  
  - **I like the ad (4):** While I appreciate energy drinks can be beneficial, my reserved nature means it doesn't resonate strongly.
  - **Interesting (3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; the idea of looking good is intriguing but not novel for me.
  - **Good (5):** Strongly agree that staying energized and looking your best are valuable promises.
  - **Attractive (2):** Finding it somewhat unattractive due to my neutral social tendencies and general cautiousness towards marketing claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend (3):** Neutral; I'm not strongly driven by the ad, but consider its potential benefits for daily life.
  - **Try (3):** Willing to give it a try based on health-related needs rather than immediate excitement from the ad.
  - **Consider (5):** High likelihood of considering purchase due to my strong work ethic and thorough approach. The emphasis aligns with maintaining productivity.

In summary, while I appreciate the value proposition conveyed in the advertisement, personal traits such as being reserved and somewhat anxious moderate how much it appeals directly but do not deter potential interest in trying or purchasing based on its practical benefits.
