**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 4):**
   - While I appreciate its upbeat nature aligning with my talkative and outgoing personality, it feels a bit superficial.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 5):** 
   - The promise of staying energized appeals to my need for productivity as a civil servant but doesn’t thrill me deeply enough.
   
3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 3):**
   - It seems generic and lacks substance, especially in relation to the specifics needed by someone with high-stress levels like mine.

4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2):** 
   - The attractiveness factor falls short due to its glossy feel which might not resonate personally or reflect genuine benefits for me given my concerns about trust and credibility.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2):**
   - Despite the ad’s appeal, practical considerations such as cost vs. benefit analysis weigh heavily, especially with a substantial monthly income but cautious spending habits.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 1):**
   - The strong tendency towards being careless and sometimes rude suggests impulsiveness, yet my generally trusting nature is balanced by skepticism of instant solutions without detailed proof.

3. **I will consider buying the product (Score: 2):** 
   - While I’m open to considering it due to its potential energy benefits, other priorities and worries about effectiveness make a definitive purchase less likely at this stage.

In summary, while the ad holds some appeal, it lacks compelling depth for my cautious yet outgoing nature. The balance of skepticism and curiosity means I won’t rush into purchasing but remain moderately interested in further exploration if credible evidence supports its claims.
