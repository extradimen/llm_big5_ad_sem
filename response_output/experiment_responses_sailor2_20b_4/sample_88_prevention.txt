**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
    - **I like the ad. (3/7)**: Neutral but slightly positive; finds it acceptable.
    - **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**: Somewhat engaging content might catch attention for a moment.
    - **I believe the ad is good. (2/7)**: Credibility seems average, not strongly persuasive.
    - **I find the ad attractive. (1/7)**: Not very appealing due to potential over-generalization and fear tactics.

- **Purchase Intention:**
    - **I intend to purchase this product. (2/7)**: Low intent; concerned about necessity since it aligns with health concerns.
    - **I will try to buy this product. (1/7)**: Even lower as the ad feels manipulative rather than informative.
    - **I will consider buying this product. (2/7)**: Mild consideration, leaning towards skeptical but not outright rejecting.

Overall, while I acknowledge its message, my personality traits and personal values make me cautious about trusting such claims immediately without further information or confirmation from reliable sources. Thus, the ad might pique curiosity slightly but doesn't compel a purchase decision strongly enough given my background and tendencies.
