**Evaluation:**

### Ad Attitudes:
- **Like (4/7):**
   - Neutral talkative nature means it's not particularly engaging but doesn't turn me off.
   
- **Interesting (3/7):**
   - The message feels somewhat generic and isn’t innovative; hence, my interest is moderate.

- **Good (5/7):** 
   - It conveys a clear benefit (avoiding tiredness/dull appearance) which aligns with basic needs, making it decently persuasive.
   
- **Attractive (2/7):**
   - The ad lacks emotional appeal or personal resonance. My reserved nature finds the presentation unimpressive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (1/7):** 
   - Strongly disagree; my current financial constraints and cautious spending habits prevent any immediate intention.
   
2. **Try to buy this product (2/7):**
   - Neutral with a slight lean towards curiosity, but the need for evidence of effectiveness is high due to skepticism about health claims.

3. **Consider buying this product (3/7):** 
   - Somewhat agree; it stays on my radar as an option if I find more credible information or lower-cost alternatives that fit within budget constraints.
   
Overall, while recognizing its benefit, the ad’s presentation and personal relevance are lacking, resulting in low immediate purchase intent. However, there is a moderate consideration for future evaluation under specific conditions (budget permitting).
