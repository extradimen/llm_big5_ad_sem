**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
  - *I like the ad.* (Score: 3) – While I appreciate the concept of staying energized and looking good, it's not overly appealing.
  - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 4) – The idea resonates somewhat as everyone can relate to wanting daily energy boosts and a positive appearance.
  - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 5) – It seems reasonably trustworthy since maintaining energy and looks are common goals, but not exceptionally compelling for me.
  - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 2) – The visual appeal might be average; I need more substance to feel genuinely drawn in.

- **Purchase Intention:** 
  - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 3) – Neutral inclination; potential interest exists but isn't strong enough for immediate action.
  - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3) – Open-minded, might give it a shot if the price and convenience align with my budget and lifestyle.
  - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4) – Will definitely keep an eye out for promotions or reviews before making a decision.

Overall, while I appreciate the message's relevance to personal well-being, there isn't enough enthusiasm to drive an immediate purchase. The ad is decent but falls short of being particularly persuasive given my personality and priorities as outlined.
