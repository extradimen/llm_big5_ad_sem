**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4): The appeal is there but not strongly resonant due to my strong agreement with thoroughness and planning over impulsivity.
   - *Interesting.* (Score: 5): It sparks some curiosity, especially focusing on staying energized, which aligns with a student's needs. However, it doesn't stand out uniquely in an oversaturated market.
   - *Good.* (Score: 6): Perceived as beneficial since the claims are plausible—staying energized and looking good is desirable for students and young adults alike.
   - *Attractive.* (Score: 3): It’s not exceptionally attractive; I value substance over flashy presentation, so a more grounded approach would be better.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2): While it seems useful, there are many options available, and my decision will depend on reviews, price, and personal experiences.
   - *Will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3): I'm willing to give a trial based on its potential benefits but won't be rushed into buying immediately.
   - *Consider buying this product.* (Score: 2): It's definitely on the radar for consideration, particularly during periods when energy is crucial.

Overall, while the ad hits some positive notes with its practical promises and good reputation, I maintain a measured approach to purchasing due to my preference for thorough evaluation before committing.
