**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (3/7):** I find the ad decent but not particularly appealing given my reserved nature and sometimes worrying disposition. It feels a bit superficial.
   - **Interesting (4/7):** The energy boost claim resonates, making it somewhat interesting, though not fully captivating.
   - **Good (5/7):** While not compelling, the messaging about staying energized is generally good; however, it lacks depth for my tastes.
   - **Attractive (2/7):** I am strongly reserved and don't find this typical "look your best" promise very attractive or relevant to me.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend (1/7):** No strong intention; the ad feels too generic for my preferences.
   - **Try (3/7):** Slightly more inclined due to needing an energy boost, but not enough to actively pursue it.
   - **Consider (4/7):** If I come across this product in a trusted context, I might consider it based on its functional benefit. 

Overall, while the ad has some merit and practical appeal for staying energized, my reserved personality and critical outlook reduce both engagement with the advertisement itself and immediate purchase intent significantly.
