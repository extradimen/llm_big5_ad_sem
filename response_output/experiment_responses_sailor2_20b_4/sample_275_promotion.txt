**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores**
   - **I like the ad**: (Score = 3) Neutral to slightly positive. The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing but not overwhelmingly engaging.
   - **Interesting**: (Score = 4) Agreeable, as it holds some interest for maintaining daily appearance and energy levels.
   - **Good Advertisement**: (Score = 5) Slightly agree; the message seems well-constructed to target health-conscious consumers like myself.
   - **Attractive**: (Score = 2) Disagree slightly. The appeal isn't strong enough given my preference for practicality over superficial claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**
   - **Intend to purchase** *(low confidence)*: (Score = 3) Neutral with a slight lean towards consideration.
   - **Will try**: (Score = 4) Agree, I might give it a shot based on the perceived benefits but not out of strong impulse.
   - **Consider buying**: (Score = 5) Strongly agree; the product aligns somewhat with my lifestyle goals, so it's worth considering in my decision-making process.

Overall, while there is some attraction to the messaging and potential benefit, deeper engagement or immediate purchase intent isn't strongly driven by this ad alone. The balance of practicality and cautious consideration reflects my personality traits and current state.
