**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad. (3)**: Neutral; The straightforward message is not particularly engaging but does convey a clear need.
- **I think the ad is interesting. (4)**: Slightly Agree; It's direct, which can catch attention initially, though it lacks creativity.
- **I believe the ad is good. (5)**: Agree; Its simplicity and focus on potential benefits make it decently effective in communicating its purpose.
- **I find the ad attractive. (3)**: Neutral; The lack of visually appealing elements or emotional connection reduces its attractiveness.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Slightly Disagree; While acknowledging a potential need, I don't feel compelled to buy immediately.
- **I will try to buy this product. (1)**: Strongly Disagree; The ad does not build enough trust or urgency for me to actively seek it out.
- **I will consider buying this product. (3)**: Neutral; It's on my radar but won't be a priority without further information or reviews.

In summary, while the advertisement effectively highlights a problem and offers a solution clearly, its execution lacks emotional appeal and does not strongly drive immediate purchase intent for someone with my background and personality traits. I'm open to considering it later based on additional factors like user testimonials or brand reputation.
