**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad:** (Score: 3) - Neutral. While I appreciate its intention to energize and look good, it lacks personal resonance.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4) - Agree. The message about staying energized resonates moderately due to my busy lifestyle as an office worker.
- **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - Neutral leaning towards Agree. The concept seems reasonable, but it's not compelling enough given my cautious nature and occasional worries.
- **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - Disagree. Thereâ€™s no strong visual or emotional appeal that matches my preferences for more practical benefits.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Strongly Disagree. Despite being talkative and task-oriented, the ad doesn't align with my current priorities.
- **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2) - Disagree. Limited willingness due to perceived relevance against more pressing needs in my daily life.
- **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 3) - Neutral leaning towards Agree. Open to considering it, but not actively planning a purchase given the moderate interest and higher priorities.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential benefits, the advertisement doesn't sufficiently connect with or motivate me as an office worker balancing daily responsibilities and limited income, leading to lower intention scores for purchasing.
