**Explanation:**

1. **Attitudinal Scores (7-point scale):**
   - **Like the ad:** Neutral to slightly positive (score = 3) – The advertisement’s claim about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with real-world experiences but lacks personal appeal.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly interesting (score = 4) – It presents a common problem, making it somewhat engaging.
   - **Good:** Moderately agreeable (score = 5) – While the message is straightforward, its effectiveness feels average rather than excellent.
   - **Attractive:** Somewhat unattractive (score = 2) – The tone and urgency feel slightly pushy, reducing its attractiveness.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product:** Likely but not strongly (score = 4) – I acknowledge the potential benefits, yet personal motivation isn't high.
   - **Try to buy this product:** Somewhat inclined (score = 3) – Curiosity might lead me to give it a try if prompted or in a promotional setting.
   - **Consider buying this product:** Willingly consider (score = 3) – Openness for future purchase exists, depending on price and availability.

Overall, the ad addresses a real concern but doesn't strongly resonate with my personal preferences or personality traits. Despite mild interest, there's not enough compelling persuasion to drive immediate action. Therefore, it falls in a middle range of consideration rather than an enthusiastic endorsement.
