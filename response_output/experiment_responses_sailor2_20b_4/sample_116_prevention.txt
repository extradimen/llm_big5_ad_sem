**Explanation:**

### **Ad Attitudes**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (4) - The straightforward message is functional but doesn't excite me.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (5) - It effectively points out fatigue and appearance issues, which are relatable concerns.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree (6) - Clear, concise messaging can be impactful for a product that addresses common problems.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Neutral to slightly Negative (3) - While informative, it doesn’t capture my attention visually or emotionally.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Low Interest (2) - The need isn't urgent enough based on current health and lifestyle.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Consideration (4) - Might give it a shot if the fatigue issue becomes persistent or noticeable improvement is guaranteed.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Moderate Intention (3) - It's on my radar, but won’t be an immediate purchase decision.

Overall, while I appreciate its relevance and effectiveness in addressing specific issues, personal preferences and current circumstances lead me to a moderate interest level rather than strong intention or instant action.
