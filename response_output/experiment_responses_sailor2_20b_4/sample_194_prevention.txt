**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like**: Neutral (`4`) — I find the ad somewhat appealing but not overly so.
   - **Interesting**: Agree (`5`) — It captures my attention and seems engaging.
   - **Good**: Strongly Agree (`6`) — The message is well-crafted and effectively conveys a need to avoid feeling tired or dull.
   - **Attractive**: Disagree (`3`) — While the content is good, it doesn’t particularly grab me emotionally.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase**: Low (`2`) — The ad resonates intellectually but isn't a strong enough motivator for immediate purchase.
   - **Try to Buy**: Moderate (`4`) — I am slightly inclined to try the product due to its promise of vitality and alertness, given my need to perform well as a managerial employee.
   - **Consider Buying**: Slightly Considerable (`3`) — While not high on my priority list currently, it's something I might consider when needing an energy boost or during periods of increased stress.

Overall, the ad is effective in conveying its message and holds some credibility. However, personal factors like a preference for practicality over emotional pull make the purchase intention moderately low but still worth considering under specific circumstances.
