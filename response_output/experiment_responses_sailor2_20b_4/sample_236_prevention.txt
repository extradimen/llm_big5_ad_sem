**Evaluation and Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:

1. **I like the ad:** (Score = 2)  
   Neutrally disapproving—given my reserved nature and dislike for unnecessary urgency.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score = 3)  
   Slightly agree—it's not engaging but uses a common fear appeal, which can be somewhat compelling.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score = 4)  
   Moderately agree—while it presents a straightforward problem-solution scenario, it feels standard without much creativity or relatability for me.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score = 2)  
   Slightly disagree—the messaging comes off as slightly manipulative and doesn't align with my preference for subtlety.

### Purchase Intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score = 2)  
   Low—despite understanding its purpose, there isn’t enough persuasive impact or personal relevance in the ad to make an immediate commitment.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score = 1)  
   Strongly disagree—I'm not motivated by fear tactics and prefer more evidence-backed recommendations before making a purchase.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score = 1)  
   Also strongly disagree—given my reserved nature, I would need additional information or personal experience to seriously contemplate purchasing it rather than just considering superficial claims.

Overall, the ad isn’t convincing enough for me given its manipulative tone and lack of deeper engagement with more reflective consumers like myself. While acknowledging the potential issues addressed, there’s insufficient appeal to drive actual purchase intent.
