**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (Score 4):** Neutral to slightly positive. The message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates moderately as it touches on common daily experiences.
   - **Interesting (Score 5):** Somewhat intriguing, especially since fatigue is a relatable issue for many adults balancing their studies or other commitments.
   - **Good (Score 3):** Average effectiveness; while the ad highlights potential problems without alternatives to address them directly, it's not compelling enough on its own.
   - **Attractive (Score 2):** Slightly unattractive. The lack of creative flair and emphasis solely on negatives makes it less appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (Score 1):** Strongly disagree; despite recognizing the problem, I don't feel compelled to purchase just based on this ad.
   - **Try (Score 1):** Disagree; no immediate inclination to sample or try the product.
   - **Consider (Score 2):** Neutral leaning towards low; might give it a brief thought if prompted by other factors but not enough motivation from this advertisement alone.

In summary, while acknowledging fatigue and its effects, the ad fails to inspire strong engagement or purchase intent due to its straightforward nature, lack of positive reinforcement, and insufficient differentiation. More detailed product benefits and appealing creative elements are necessary for higher scores in both attitude and intention.
