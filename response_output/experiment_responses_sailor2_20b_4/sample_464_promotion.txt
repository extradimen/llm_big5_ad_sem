**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - **Like**: Neutral (3): The message resonates with staying energized, but the talkative aspect of my personality means I'm more focused on interaction rather than just product ads.
  - **Interesting**: Agree (4): The promise to look best every day is intriguing and relatable for someone balancing studies and personal life.
  - **Good**: Strongly Agree (5): It aligns with health-conscious goals, making it seem like a positive addition in managing daily routines.
  - **Attractive**: Disagree (2): While the concept appeals, my reserved nature means I don't find ads overly attractive; they need to connect more personally.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - **Intend to Purchase**: Consider (3): The benefits are appealing but not decisive enough given other factors like budget and product credibility.
  - **Try to Buy**: Try (3): There's a willingness to give it a shot, particularly if recommended by peers or through trusted sources.
  - **Consider Buying**: Intend to Consider (4): Despite my worries about new products, the ad nudges me towards considering this drink as part of maintaining an active lifestyle.

Overall, while I appreciate the promotion and find aspects compelling, personal hesitations like emotional stability and cautious nature prevent a strong immediate buy decision but keep it in the realm of consideration.
