**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
  - **Like (Score 2):** The ad lacks personal appeal due to its blunt tone and overemphasis on negative consequences.
  - **Interesting (Score 3):** While it captures attention with a clear message, it feels generic rather than intriguing.
  - **Good (Score 4):** It conveys the product benefit effectively but doesn’t stand out as particularly well-crafted or creative.
  - **Attractive (Score 1):** The ad is not visually appealing to me; it comes across as manipulative and overbearing, which negatively impacts my perception.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend (Score 2):** Despite understanding the product’s potential benefits, I'm not compelled enough to immediately intend a purchase.
  - **Try (Score 2):** Given that it addresses fatigue and appearance concerns, there is some interest but no strong motivation to try right away.
  - **Consider (Score 3):** The ad does prompt me to consider the product in case of future need or if I have an opportunity to experience its effects firsthand.

Overall, while recognizing the functional benefits, my reserved nature and cautious approach lead me to a moderate interest without driving strong purchase intent. Credibility could be improved with more nuanced messaging and a compelling presentation.
