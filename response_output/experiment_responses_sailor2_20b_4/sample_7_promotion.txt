**Evaluation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - I like the ad (Score: 4): The tagline is engaging and resonates with staying energized but doesn't significantly excite me.
   - It's interesting (Score: 3): Basic and straightforward, not particularly innovative for my preferences.
   - I believe it’s good (Score: 5): Generally positive message about energy levels and appearance; holds credibility.
   - Attractive (Score: 2): The visual appeal is minimal without any standout design or lifestyle imagery to grab attention.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - Intent to purchase (Score: 2): While useful benefits are highlighted, personal interest in the product isn't strong enough for a definite buy.
   - Will try (Score: 3): Open-minded but not compelled; might consider testing it out based on peers’ feedback or promotions.
   - Consider buying (Score: 4): The message aligns with my need to stay energized, so I’m willing to evaluate further before making a purchase decision.

Overall, the ad is moderately persuasive due to its practical benefits but falls short in excitement and emotional resonance. Practical value exists without overwhelming intent for immediate action or strong preference.
