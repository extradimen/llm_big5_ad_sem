**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**  
  1. **I like the ad (Score: 3)** - I don't particularly dislike it but find it mildly acceptable given my reserved nature.
  2. **Interesting (Score: 4)** - The promise of energy and looking good is intriguing, though not exceptionally engaging for me.
  3. **Good (Score: 5)** - It seems a decent advertisement with some relevance to daily life, aligning somewhat with my values but lacks strong appeal.
  4. **Attractive (Score: 2)** - I find it less attractive as an individual due to personal reservations and the high emphasis on appearance which may not resonate deeply.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  1. **Intend to purchase (Score: 1)** - Given my current financial situation, daily priorities, and practical focus, I'm unlikely to intend a spontaneous purchase.
  2. **Try to buy (Score: 3)** - If the drink were available on sale or recommended by someone trustworthy, I might consider giving it a try but not actively seek it out.
  3. **Consider buying (Score: 3)** - With my busy schedule and need for energy boosters, thereâ€™s some consideration value; however, other factors would heavily influence whether I actually buy.

Overall, while the ad is decently presented, its focus on appearance might be less prioritized in my decision-making process as a blue-collar worker with family responsibilities. Practicality and trustworthiness remain key considerations for purchasing decisions.
