3. **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 5) - Slightly positive leaning towards agree; clear messaging can make an impression despite some reservations on effectiveness.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2) - Disagree; while it hits key points, its appeal feels somewhat generic and lacks strong visual or emotional hooks.

### Purchase Intentions:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree; my budget constraints and skepticism about immediate benefits make actual purchasing unlikely.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 3) - Neutral leaning towards yes, suggesting a willingness to consider it under specific circumstances but not actively pursuing.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2) - Agree; the ad may prompt reconsideration if fatigue becomes significant or during sales/promotions.
