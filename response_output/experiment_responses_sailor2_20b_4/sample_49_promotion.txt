**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (2)** - As a reserved individual who strongly disagrees with being talkative and sometimes rude, I find this energetic pitch slightly off-putting.
2. **Interesting (3)** - The promise of staying energized is engaging but doesn't fully capture my interest given more subdued personality traits.
3. **Good (4)** - It's conceptually good for someone looking to boost their daily performance, aligns with the strong agreement on doing thorough jobs and making plansâ€”however, it lacks emotional resonance for me personally.
4. **Attractive (1)** - While not overtly unappealing, I find this ad less attractive due to its emphasis on external appearance which feels somewhat superficial.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend (2)** - The product might be useful but doesn't align strongly with my current needs or lifestyle preferences.
2. **Try (3)** - There's mild curiosity and willingness to give it a try, especially considering the need for energy management post-divorce life changes.
3. **Consider (4)** - I would definitely consider buying based on potential benefits while factoring in budget constraints (<15,000,000 VND) and personal alignment.

Overall, there's moderate to low positive sentiment towards the ad but higher consideration for purchase intent due to practical utility despite initial reservations.
