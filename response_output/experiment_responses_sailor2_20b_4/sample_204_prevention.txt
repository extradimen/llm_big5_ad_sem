**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** *Score = 2* (Strongly Disagree)
   - Given my reserved nature and lack of enthusiasm for over-the-top claims, I find this message unconvincing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score = 3* (Disagree)
   - The language feels exaggerated and doesn't genuinely engage me.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score = 4* (Neutral)
   - It attempts to be informative, but lacks credibility for my personal experience and preferences.

4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score = 2* (Strongly Disagree)
   - The appeal falls flat due to its manipulative tone and overemphasis on negative consequences.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score = 1* (Strongly Disagree)
   - Without a strong emotional or rational connection, there's no intention to buy based on the ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score = 2* (Disagree)
   - The persuasive effort is insufficient; I wouldn't take action without additional evidence or recommendations from trusted sources.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score = 3* (Neutral)
   - While not rejecting outright, the ad won't push me to actively seek out the product; further information might sway my decision slightly. 

Overall, while I appreciate the attempt at preventing tiredness and dull appearance, its execution doesnâ€™t align with my values or personal comfort levels in advertising effectiveness. Thus, both attitude scores are low, leading to a neutral-to-negative purchase intention.
