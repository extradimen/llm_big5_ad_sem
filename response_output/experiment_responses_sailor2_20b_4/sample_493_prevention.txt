**Evaluation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - **I like the ad:** Neutral — While I appreciate its purpose, my reserved nature means I don't find it particularly engaging.
  - **Interesting:** Agree — The concept of preventing fatigue is interesting and relatable for a student balancing studies and responsibilities.
  - **Believe the ad is good:** Strongly Agree — It effectively highlights potential issues (tiredness, dull appearance) to create concern and urgency.
  - **Attractive:** Strongly Agree — The messaging feels targeted at addressing common stressors in my life, making it appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - **Intend to purchase this product:** Disagree — Though I understand its benefits, current budget constraints (36–45 million VND monthly) and the presence of other cost-effective solutions make me hesitant.
  - **Try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree — Given my financial situation and existing habits, there's no immediate motivation to try a new product right now.
  - **Consider buying it:** Neutral — While I acknowledge its potential value, I'd evaluate alternatives or future necessity before making a purchase.

Overall, the ad resonates in terms of effectiveness but does not lead directly to an imminent purchase decision due to practical considerations.
