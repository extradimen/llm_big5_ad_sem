**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (Score = 3):** The ad resonates somewhat but not strongly; it's decent.
   - **Interesting (Score = 4):** Neutral interest—enough to catch attention without being captivating.
   - **Good (Score = 5):** It conveys a credible message about energy and appearance, making the claim seem plausible.
   - **Attractive (Score = 2):** Not particularly attractive as it lacks creativity or strong emotional appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral inclination; while the product seems beneficial for staying alert and looking good, there's no immediate urgency or high motivation.
   - **Try to Buy:** Mild interest but not a compelling reason yet—may consider trying it out if given more information or special offers.
   - **Consider Buying:** Will definitely keep this option in mind due to its potential benefits, though other factors (e.g., price, brand reputation) will influence the final decision.

Overall, while the ad is effective in conveying functional value and credibility, I'm not highly motivated by it alone. A balanced approach considering additional aspects such as cost-effectiveness or personal needs would be necessary before making a purchase.
