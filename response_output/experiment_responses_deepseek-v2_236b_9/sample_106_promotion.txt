Explanation of scores:
- The ad is moderately attractive to me (score 5) as it claims a benefit that could be appealing. However, I find the claim somewhat vague and generic (not particularly original or specific), hence the lower scores for finding it good (2) and interesting (3). It's not unlikable but doesn't stand out either (like score 4).
- My purchase intention is low because of my skepticism towards general health claims without more concrete evidence. I would consider buying if there were additional information supporting the ad's claim, hence the scores for "consider" (3) and "try" (2), but not high enough to intend a purchase immediately (1).
