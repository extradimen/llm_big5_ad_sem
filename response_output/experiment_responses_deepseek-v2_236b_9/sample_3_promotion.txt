Explanation:
- The advertisement is somewhat appealing to me as a person in my demographic profile. I find it interesting (score 5) because staying energized is relevant for anyone regardless of age or background. However, the claim about looking one's best every day feels less compelling to someone who is older and may not prioritize appearance as much (hence lower scores on "like" and "attractive").
- The ad seems good in a general sense (score 3), but it doesn't particularly resonate with my personal values or preferences, especially the part about being unselfish with others.
- Regarding purchase intention, I would consider buying this product (score 3) to see if it lives up to its claims about energy levels, but I don't have a strong intent to buy immediately (score 1), and whether I try it or not will depend on further information or reviews (score 2).
