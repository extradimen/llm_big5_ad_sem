Explanation:
- The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing to me as a young adult who values being outgoing and sociable. However, my neutral stance on artistic interests means I don't find the ad particularly attractive (score 3). Nonetheless, it seems interesting enough (score 5) and good in its message (score 6), but not something that I strongly like (score 4).
- My purchase intention is somewhat low. While I agree with doing a thorough job and making plans to follow through with them, my disagreement on being helpful and unselfish suggests that the ad's appeal doesn't necessarily translate into an immediate desire to buy the product (intend: score 2). There might be some consideration due to its promise of energy (consider: score 4), but I wouldn't actively try to purchase it right away (try: score 1).
