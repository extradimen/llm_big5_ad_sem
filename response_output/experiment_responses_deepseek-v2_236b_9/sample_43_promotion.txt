Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat interesting and attractive (scoring a 4 and 5 respectively), which indicates that it captures some attention. However, there is not an overwhelming liking or belief in its goodness, as indicated by lower scores of 3 for "I like the ad" and "I think the ad is good."
- **Purchase intention**: The low score for "intend to purchase this product" (1) suggests that while it's interesting, it doesn't necessarily compel immediate action. However, there is a mild interest in trying or considering the product with scores of 2 and 3 respectively, indicating potential exploration but not a strong commitment to purchasing at this stage.
