Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4) as it appeals to the desire for energy and looking one's best. It is found interesting enough to hold attention (score 5), but not particularly outstanding in terms of being good or attractive, hence scores of 4 and 3 respectively.
- **Purchase Intention**: There is a low intention to immediately purchase the product (score 2), as there may be skepticism about its claims. However, it's acknowledged that it could be something worth trying out if other factors like price and reviews align favorably (score 1). The consideration of buying the product is present but not strong (score 3), suggesting a more cautious approach to purchasing decisions.
