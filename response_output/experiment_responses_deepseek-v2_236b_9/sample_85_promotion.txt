Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I have a somewhat positive attitude towards the advertisement. It is interesting (score 4) and attractive to me as an outgoing person who might be interested in staying energized (score 5). However, my skepticism about being generally trusting (disagreeing with that trait) leads me to not fully endorse its goodness (score 2) or a strong liking for the ad (score 3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, my intention to purchase is low. This could be due to being a student with limited income, as well as my neutral stance on worry and emotional stability, which might make me cautious about spending. Thus, while I will consider buying the product (score 3), there's no strong intent or plan to immediately try it out (scores 1 and 2 are low).
