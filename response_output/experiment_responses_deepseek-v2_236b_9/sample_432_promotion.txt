Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find it moderately likable (score of 3), somewhat interesting (score of 4), and good in terms of its message (also score of 4). The ad is attractive to me because it promises something that aligns with my desire to look my best, which appeals to my artistic interests (score of 5).
- Purchase intention: I am leaning towards considering buying the product (score of 4) as the advertisement's claim about staying energized and looking one's best resonates with me. However, I would not strongly intend to purchase it immediately (score of 2), nor will I necessarily try to buy it right away (score of 3). These scores reflect my cautious approach due to my worry trait and tendency to be thorough in decision-making.
