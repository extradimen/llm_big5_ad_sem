Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is moderately liked (score 3), finds it interesting enough to pay attention (score 4), thinks it's a good ad in general (score 3), and finds it somewhat attractive but not overwhelmingly so (score 5). This reflects a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement, with some interest due to its promise of energy and looking one's best.
- **Purchase intention:** There is minimal intention to purchase at this moment (score 1), a slight willingness to try or seek more information about the product (score 2), but also an openness to consider purchasing in the future if other factors align, such as positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources (score 3). This indicates that while the ad has caught attention, there is not yet strong motivation to buy without further consideration and possibly external influence.
