Explanation of scores:
- Attitude towards the advertisement: While I am outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), my reservations about being trusting or helpful may lead me to be more critical of advertisements. However, as someone with an active imagination and a penchant for originality, I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 5) because it taps into the desire to look one's best and stay energized, which aligns with my sociable nature. The claim that the drink helps in these aspects is interesting enough to catch my attention (score 4), but I am not fully convinced of its goodness or appeal (scores 2 and 3).
- Purchase intention: Given my personality traits, particularly my tendency to make plans and follow through with them (Strongly Disagree) and my nervousness and worry (Agree), my purchase intentions are low. I would consider buying the product if it were highly recommended by trusted sources or proven effective, but as of now, my intent is not strong enough to commit to purchasing (score 1). I might try to buy this product if there's a compelling reason or promotion that overcomes my initial skepticism (score 2), and consideration would depend on further information or social influence (score 3).
