Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The ad is somewhat liked (4), found interesting to a moderate degree (5), considered good but not exceptional (4), and moderately attractive (3). As an individual who tends to be reserved and thorough in decision-making, the advertisement's claim about staying energized aligns with the need for energy as a managerial employee. However, skepticism due to being generally trusting is reflected in scores that are positive but not overly enthusiastic.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: The intention to purchase (2) indicates an openness to consider buying the product, likely based on the helpful and unselfish trait of wanting to perform at one's best for work. The score "try" (1) suggests a cautious approach, possibly due to the strong agreement with being nervous and worrying about making thorough decisions. Finally, the consideration to buy (3) reflects the personality trait of making plans and following through, which means there is a thought process before any purchasing decision.
