Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As an outgoing and talkative individual with a postgraduate degree and a civil servant background, I find the ad to be appealing. It aligns with my desire to look my best every day, which is important in my professional life as a public official. The claim that the drink helps stay energized also resonates with me, given my active social life and work responsibilities. However, while I find it attractive (5), there's some skepticism about whether it can truly deliver on its promise without further information or evidence.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad is interesting and good, my purchase intention is moderate. As a consumer with a postgraduate education and a civil servant role, I am likely to be more discerning and require additional information before making a purchasing decision. The scores reflect an openness to consider (5) and even try (4) the product if it comes recommended by trusted sources or has credible reviews, but there is not yet a strong intention to purchase immediately (3).
