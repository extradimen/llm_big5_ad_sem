Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral. The advertisement is not particularly appealing to me due to my reserved and unartistic personality, but it doesn't evoke a strong dislike either.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly agree. While I am not outgoing or imaginative, the promise of energy and looking one's best does have some appeal, even if it's not something that strongly resonates with me.
- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Disagree slightly. The advertisement seems to make broad claims without much specificity, which doesn't instill a high level of trust in its message.
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Agree somewhat. Although I am not particularly drawn to new ideas or artistic interests, the universal appeal of looking and feeling good does have some attractiveness to it.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. Given my financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND monthly income) and my cautious nature regarding trusting advertisements, I am not inclined to make an immediate purchase.
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Disagree slightly. While the ad doesn't inspire a strong intent to purchase, it might be something I consider in the future if other factors align, such as budget and need.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral. The advertisement hasn't convinced me of its merits enough to make an immediate decision, but it could potentially influence my consideration for a future purchase under different circumstances.
