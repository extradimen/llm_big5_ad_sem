Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  1. I like the ad (score 3): Neutral leaning towards agreement because while it's not particularly appealing to my artistic interests or imagination, it does present a positive message about energy and appearance which can be relevant for someone in their 40s looking to maintain a good lifestyle.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Agreeing that the ad captures attention with its claim of providing daily benefits, which aligns with my outgoing nature and desire to look my best every day.
  3. I believe the ad is good (score 2): Slightly disagree because although it's not offensive or manipulative, there isn't enough information provided about how the drink actually works, making its claims seem less credible based on my generally trusting score of Strongly Disagree.
  4. I find the ad attractive (score 5): Agreeing as the message resonates with my personal values and preferences for staying energized and looking good, even though it may not be artistically appealing to me personally.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree because without more information about its effectiveness or credibility, I am unlikely to make an immediate decision to buy based on my cautious nature and lack of trust in the ad's claims.
  2. I will try to buy this product (score 1): Similarly, strongly disagreeing due to concerns over thoroughness and potential carelessness when making purchasing decisions without further research or evidence supporting the advertised benefits.
  3. I will consider buying this product (score 2): Slightly agreeing that while I'm not fully convinced by the advertisement alone, if additional information becomes available or recommendations from trusted sources support its effectiveness, then it could be something worth considering for purchase in future based on my need to manage energy levels and appearance effectively.
