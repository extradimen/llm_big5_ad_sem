Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude**: I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and it's a good advertisement in general (score 5), but I don't particularly like it (score 3) or find it very attractive (score 2). As an older individual with a postgraduate degree, I may appreciate its attempt to promote energy and appearance but am not overly drawn to the concept.
- **Purchase Intention**: While I acknowledge the ad as good, my intention to purchase is low due to factors such as income level (<15,000,000 VND), which might limit discretionary spending on non-essential items like a drink for staying energized and looking one's best. Therefore, my scores reflect little intent (score 1) or willingness to try (score 2) but some consideration given the product's advertised benefits (score 3).
