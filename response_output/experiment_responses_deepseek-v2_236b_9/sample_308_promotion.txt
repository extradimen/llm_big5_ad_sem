Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat likeable (4), interesting enough to pay attention to (5), but not necessarily good in terms of its message or presentation (3). However, it is attractive as it promises energy and appearance benefits which are appealing (6).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad does catch my interest, I'm not immediately convinced to purchase the product (2). I would try to buy it if there were more compelling reasons or reviews supporting its claims. Nonetheless, I might consider buying the product in the future, depending on further information and personal needs (3).
