Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I have a neutral to slightly positive view of the ad. It's not particularly compelling based on my personality traits (e.g., strong disagreement with talkative and helpful), but it does catch my attention enough to rate it as somewhat interesting and attractive, while only mildly good.
- Purchase intention: Despite finding the ad moderately appealing, my intentions to purchase are low. This is due to my demographic profile where I have a lower monthly income (<15,000,000 VND), which makes me cautious about spending on products that may not align with my priorities or needs, especially since I am more focused on doing a thorough job and less on personal appearance or energy levels. Therefore, the intention to buy is low, but there's still a possibility of considering it if other factors such as price and necessity come into play.
