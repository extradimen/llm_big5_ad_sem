Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find the ad moderately appealing (score 4 for liking it), somewhat interesting (score 5), but not particularly convincing as to its quality or effectiveness (score 3). The attractiveness is quite low because, despite my active imagination, I do not see a strong connection between the product and looking one's best every day (score 2).
- **Purchase intention:** My initial reaction is that I am unlikely to purchase this product based on the advertisement alone (score 1 for intending to buy), but there might be some curiosity if it were available in my vicinity, leading me to at least consider not actively avoiding it (score 1 for trying and score 2 for considering). However, given my skeptical nature regarding trustworthiness of such claims and my neutral stance on being thorough with jobs, I am leaning towards a lack of interest.
