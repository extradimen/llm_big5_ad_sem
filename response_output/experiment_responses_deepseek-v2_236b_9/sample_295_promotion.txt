Explanation:
- Ad Attitude Scores: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score of 5) and it's interesting to me (score of 4), but I don't strongly believe it's good (score of 2). My liking for the ad is neutral, hence a score of 3.
- Purchase Intention Scores: While the ad has caught my attention, my intention to purchase is low at this moment (score of 1). However, I might try to buy it if other factors such as price and availability are favorable (score of 2), and I am open to considering the product for a future purchase (score of 3).
