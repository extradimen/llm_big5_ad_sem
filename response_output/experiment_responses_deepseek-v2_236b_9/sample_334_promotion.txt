Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score of 6) because it speaks to being energized and looking good, which could appeal to my outgoing personality. However, I'm not fully convinced it is a "good" ad (score of 3), as it seems like a common claim that many energy drinks make without much originality. The ad is interesting enough (score of 5) for me to pay attention, and moderately likable (score of 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad captures my interest, I'm not strongly intending to purchase the product immediately (score of 2), as I would likely consider other factors such as price and brand reputation. It is possible that if the product were on sale or came with a good offer, I might try it out (score of 1). Overall, I will keep it in mind but not actively seek to buy it right away (score of 3).
