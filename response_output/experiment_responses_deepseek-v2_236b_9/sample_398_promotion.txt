Explanation: As a reserved but helpful and generally trusting individual with an active imagination, I find the advertisement somewhat appealing in terms of its promise to help stay energized and look one's best. However, my talkative nature is not strongly engaged by the ad, hence the moderate scores for liking it (4), finding it interesting (5), believing it good (5), but less so attractive (3). My purchase intention reflects a cautious approach: I am somewhat interested in trying to buy this product (2) and would consider it further (3), but do not strongly intend to purchase immediately (1).
