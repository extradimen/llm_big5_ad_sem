Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4), interesting to a moderate extent (score 5), but only moderately good in terms of its quality (score 3). It's attractive enough to catch my attention, though not overwhelmingly so (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does pique my interest, I am not fully convinced to purchase the product yet (score 2). However, it has made me consider buying it if other factors align, such as reviews or recommendations from trusted sources (score 3).
