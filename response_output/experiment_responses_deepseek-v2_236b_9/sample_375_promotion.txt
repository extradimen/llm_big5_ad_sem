Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad moderately likable (4) and somewhat interesting (5), but it doesn't strike me as exceptionally good (3). It is attractive enough to catch my attention (4), given that I am original and come up with new ideas, which may align with a product claiming innovation.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad has caught my interest, my intention to purchase isn't strong (2). However, I would consider buying this product if other factors such as reviews or recommendations from trusted sources support its claims (4), given that I am generally trusting and helpful with others.
