Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) and it is interesting to me (score 5), which makes it good enough for my taste (score 4). However, liking an ad doesn't necessarily mean I love it; hence, a moderate score of 4.
- Purchase intention: While I am open to considering the product (score 5), there isn't a strong intent to purchase right away (score 2) nor a firm commitment to try it out immediately (score 3). The scores reflect an interest that is subject to further information or circumstances before any purchasing decision.
