Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately appealing to me. It's interesting and has a positive message about energy and appearance, which aligns with my neutral stance on sociability and desire for emotional stability (which could be associated with staying energized). However, as someone who strongly disagrees with being talkative or having an active imagination, the ad doesn't resonate fully in terms of creativity or conversation-starting appeal.
- **Purchase intention**: While I find the ad somewhat appealing, my intention to purchase is only moderate. As a civil servant with a postgraduate degree and a reserved personality, I value thoroughness and planning. The advertisement alone does not provide enough information about the product's efficacy or credibility for me to strongly intend to buy it immediately. However, I would consider further research into the product before making a decision, hence the middle scores on purchase intention.
