Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a person who is outgoing and sociable (Agree), helpful and unselfish with others (Strongly Agree), generally trusting (Agree), but also sometimes gets nervous easily (Agree) and emotionally unstable (Disagree), the advertisement about staying energized and looking one's best might be appealing to some extent. However, the scores indicate a moderate interest rather than strong agreement due to potential skepticism or personal preferences not fully aligned with the ad's message.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: The low scores in purchase intention reflect that while there may be some interest in the product based on the advertisement, it does not strongly motivate immediate purchasing action. This could be due to factors such as a thorough job (Strongly Disagree), making plans and following through with them (Neutral), or being careless (Neutral). These traits suggest an individual who is more cautious about making purchases without further research or consideration.
