Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) and think it's good (score 5). It is interesting enough to catch my attention (score 4), but not overwhelmingly likeable (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: The ad does pique my interest, so I am considering buying the product (score 5). There's a possibility that I will try it out (score 3) and may even intend to purchase if further information supports its claims (score 2), but these are not firm commitments.
