Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. The claim that it helps stay energized and look one's best is somewhat attractive (score 5), but not particularly convincing or interesting for me personally (scores 4 and 2). I don't strongly dislike or like it, hence a score of 3 for liking the ad.
- Purchase intention: Given my neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement, my purchase intention is low. I am not inclined to immediately buy the product (score 1), but if there are specific benefits that align with my needs or preferences, I might consider it (score 3). There's a possibility of trying it out depending on additional information (score 2).
