Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking), potentially interesting to someone who values staying energized and looking their best (score 5). It's perceived as a good ad in terms of promoting its message effectively (score 6), but not particularly attractive, perhaps because it doesn't resonate deeply with the individual's artistic interests or concerns about credibility (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: The low scores for purchase intention indicate that while the ad is considered interesting and a good promotion, there isn't a strong intent to purchase the product. The person might consider buying it if they come across it in their shopping experience (score 3), but they don't have immediate plans to seek out or buy the drink (scores 1 and 2).
