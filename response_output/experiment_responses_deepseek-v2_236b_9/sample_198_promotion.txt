Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting (score of 4 for both), which is not surprising given my talkative nature and agreement with having new ideas. However, I am slightly skeptical about its claims to make me look my best every day, hence a lower score of 3 for believing it's good. The attractiveness of the ad doesn't necessarily translate into complete belief in its message, so that remains at 4.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is moderately appealing, as someone who values thoroughness and is emotionally unstable (according to my profile), I may not be easily swayed by an advertisement alone. Therefore, my purchase intentions are somewhat low with a score of 2 for intending to buy and trying to buy, but there's still some consideration at a score of 3, which could depend on other factors such as reviews or personal experience.
