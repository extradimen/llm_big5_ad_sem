Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad somewhat interesting (score 4) and good in its intent to promote energy (score 5), but it's not particularly attractive to me personally (score 2). The claim about looking one's best is less compelling, hence a lower score for liking the ad overall (score 3).
- Purchase intention: Given my demographic profile as someone who values thoroughness and tends to worry, I am more cautious with purchases. Therefore, while I might consider buying this product if it aligns with my needs (score 3), I would not immediately intend to purchase it (score 1) or actively try to buy it without further consideration (score 2).
