Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is seen as somewhat interesting and good, but not particularly attractive or likable. This may be due to the demographic profile's artistic interests being few, which could make them less drawn to an ad that implies aesthetic benefits ("look your best"). The reserved nature might also contribute to a more muted response.
- **Purchase intention**: There is some interest in considering the product, possibly because of the promise of staying energized, which aligns with the occupation as a blue-collar worker who may need energy for work. However, there isn't a strong intent or immediate plan to try it, perhaps due to other factors such as income level and trust issues.
