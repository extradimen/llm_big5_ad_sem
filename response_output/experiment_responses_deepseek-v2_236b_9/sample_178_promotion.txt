Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is not particularly compelling to me given my reserved nature and lack of artistic interests. However, as someone who values planning and following through with them, I find the promise of staying energized appealing for work efficiency. Thus, while it's not a strongly attractive ad, it does hold some interest for its practical claim.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite having a somewhat neutral to slightly positive view on the advertisement, my purchasing decisions are more influenced by budget constraints and the need for thorough research on product effectiveness before making a purchase. Therefore, I intend to look into other options first (1), but if this appears to be the best option within my price range after researching, I might try it (2). If no better alternatives emerge, then I will consider buying this product as a last resort (3).
