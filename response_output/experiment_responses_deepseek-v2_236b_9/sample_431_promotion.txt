Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: As a civil servant with a high school education and modest income, I am generally practical in my approach to advertisements. The ad for an energy drink that promises both increased energy and appearance enhancement is somewhat appealing due to its promise of benefits. However, as someone who values thoroughness and does not have many artistic interests, the appeal may be more functional than aesthetic.
  - **I like the ad**: Score 3 (Neutral-Agree) because while it doesn't particularly stand out, it has a practical message that could resonate with my needs for energy in my work as a civil servant.
  - **I think the ad is interesting**: Score 4 (Agree) because the dual promise of increased energy and appearance enhancement is an interesting combination that may be relevant to me.
  - **I believe the ad is good**: Score 4 (Agree) considering its straightforward message, which aligns with my practical nature.
  - **I find the ad attractive**: Score 5 (Moderately Agree) as it addresses a need for energy and an aspirational aspect of looking one's best, which could be appealing to me despite not being strongly outgoing or talkative.

- **Purchase intention**: While I am generally trusting and helpful, my income constraints might limit impulsive purchases. However, the promise of increased energy is something that aligns with my practical needs for work, so it warrants consideration.
  - **I intend to purchase this product**: Score 2 (Disagree) as budgetary concerns likely take precedence over an immediate intention to buy.
  - **I will try to buy this product**: Score 3 (Neutral-Agree) because while I may not immediately plan to purchase, it's something that could be considered if the benefits are deemed valuable enough within my financial constraints.
  - **I will consider buying this product**: Score 4 (Moderately Agree) as the practical appeal of increased energy for work is a consideration, even though other factors such as cost and thoroughness in evaluating its claims would also play a role in the decision-making process.
