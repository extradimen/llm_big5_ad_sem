Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is somewhat liked (score 3), finds it interesting (score 4), thinks it's fairly good (score 2), and attractive to some extent (score 5). This reflects a mixed response, with interest but not necessarily strong agreement on all aspects.
- **Purchase intention:** There is minimal intent to purchase the product (score 1), meaning there isn't a strong inclination to buy it immediately. However, the ad may prompt an attempt to buy if convenient (score 1) and some consideration for future purchases (score 2). This indicates that while not highly motivated by the ad, there is potential interest in the product under certain conditions.
