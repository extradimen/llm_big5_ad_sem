Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude:** As a civil servant with a neutral stance on outgoing behavior and talkativeness, I find the advertisement moderately interesting (5) and somewhat good (4), but not overly attractive (3). The claim about staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my desire for emotional stability and thorough job performance.
- **Purchase Intention:** While I am open to new ideas and consider myself original, my agreement that I have few artistic interests might make me less inclined to seek out products based on aesthetic appeal alone. Therefore, while the advertisement is moderately appealing, my intention to purchase (1) or even try (2) the product is relatively low, with only a consideration to buy it (3). My neutral stance on making plans and following through may also affect my purchasing decisions, as I am neither particularly impulsive nor overly cautious when considering new products.
