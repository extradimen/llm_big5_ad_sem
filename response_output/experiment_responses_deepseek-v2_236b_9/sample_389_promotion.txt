Explanation: As a young male office worker living with parents in China, I find the advertisement moderately appealing due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which aligns with my need for sustained performance at work. However, my skepticism regarding new ideas (Strongly Disagree) makes me question the originality of the claim. My emotional stability is neutral, so while I am not strongly attracted to the ad, it does catch my attention. The promise of looking one's best resonates more with me than the energy aspect, hence a higher score for attractiveness.

Regarding purchase intention, although I find the ad somewhat appealing, my tendency to worry and get nervous makes me cautious about trying new products without further research or recommendations from trusted sources. Therefore, while I am open to considering the product, my intent to purchase is low, as I would likely seek more information before committing to a buy.
