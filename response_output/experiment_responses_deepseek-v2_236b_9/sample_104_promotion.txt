Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likeable (score 4), interesting enough to pay attention (score 5), and generally good as an ad (score 4). However, it's not exceptionally attractive to me personally (score 3), possibly due to my strong agreement with having few artistic interests.
- **Purchase intention**: While the advertisement is moderately appealing, I am only slightly inclined to consider purchasing the product (score 2) and intend to try buying it if circumstances allow (score 1). The consideration score (3) indicates that while I find the ad interesting, my actual purchase decision would depend on further information or potential benefits of the product.
