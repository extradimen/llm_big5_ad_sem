Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. While it's not particularly appealing due to my reserved nature and lack of artistic interests, the claim that the drink helps with energy does resonate somewhat with my occupation as an office worker who might need a boost during workdays. However, being generally trusting is low on my traits list means I am skeptical of such claims.
  - Like: 3 (Neutral)
  - Interesting: 4 (Moderately agree)
  - Good: 3 (Neutral)
  - Attractive: 5 (Agree somewhat)
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Although the ad is not strongly persuasive, it does have elements that could make me consider trying out the product. My tendency to be thorough and planful means I might look for more information before purchasing. Additionally, my worry about being nervous easily might lead me to seek ways to manage stress, which this drink claims to help with.
  - Intend: 2 (Slightly disagree)
  - Try: 3 (Neutral)
  - Consider: 4 (Moderately agree)
