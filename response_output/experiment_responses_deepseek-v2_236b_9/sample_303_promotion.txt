Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) as it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. However, while it is interesting enough to hold my attention (score 5), I don't necessarily think it's a particularly outstanding or 'good' advertisement in terms of creativity or impact (score 3). My liking for the ad is moderate (score 4) as it doesn't strongly resonate with me but isn't off-putting either.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: I don't have a strong intention to purchase this product based on the advertisement alone (score 1), although if there were other factors like recommendations or reviews, I might try to buy it (score 2). It is something that could be considered for future purchases (score 3) but not an immediate decision.
