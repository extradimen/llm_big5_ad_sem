Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's claim of energy and looking one's best is appealing but not a strong selling point for me personally.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Slightly more than neutral because it does make a claim that could be relevant to daily life, even if not particularly unique or innovative.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral with a slight negative tilt. The ad's message is common and doesn't stand out as exceptional in any way.
- I find the ad attractive (score 2): Slightly disagree. While it has a clear message, it lacks an emotional or imaginative appeal that would make it truly attractive to someone who values originality and imagination like me.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree. The ad does not convince me of the necessity or uniqueness of the product enough to warrant a purchase.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): Strongly disagree as well. Similar reasoning, lack of strong appeal or need for the product.
- I will consider buying this product (score 2): Slightly more than strongly disagree because while it's not something I am drawn to immediately, under certain circumstances (like a recommendation from someone else), I might entertain the idea of considering it.
