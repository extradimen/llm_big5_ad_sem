Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** The ad's claim of helping to stay energized and looking one's best is somewhat appealing (score 3 for liking the ad), especially since it could potentially align with a desire to maintain good health and appearance. It seems moderately interesting as it addresses an everyday need (score 4). Whether or not it's "good" is subjective, but there's no immediate negative reaction (score 2). The attractiveness of the ad may be more related to personal taste; in this case, it doesn't seem unattractive (score 5).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite having some interest in the product claims, the intention to purchase is low (score 1), as there might be skepticism or a preference for other methods of staying energized and looking good. However, if proven credible through further information or recommendations from trusted sources, it could move to trying out the product (score 2). The consideration phase (score 3) suggests that while not immediately inclined to buy, the possibility is acknowledged with more evidence or positive feedback.
