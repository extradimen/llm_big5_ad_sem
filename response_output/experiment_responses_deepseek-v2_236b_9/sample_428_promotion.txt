Explanation of Scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement:
  1. I like the ad (Score: 3) - Neutral interest in the ad, as it doesn't strongly appeal but is not disliked either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4) - Slightly above neutral due to curiosity about its claim of energy enhancement.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score: 3) - Acknowledging that it serves a purpose for some consumers, but not personally compelling.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score: 2) - Below average attractiveness as it doesn't align with strong artistic interests or innovation.

- Purchase intention:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score: 1) - Strongly disagree, indicating no immediate plan to buy based on the ad alone.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score: 1) - Again, strongly disagree as there is not a compelling reason to actively seek out the product right away.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score: 2) - Slightly agree, suggesting that it might be considered in the future if other factors align or further information supports its claims.
