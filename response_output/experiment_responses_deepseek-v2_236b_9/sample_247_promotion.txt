Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately attractive (score 6), somewhat interesting (score 5), but only marginally good (score 3). The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is appealing to my outgoing nature, but I am skeptical about its credibility.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad does not fully convince me of its claims, it has piqued enough interest for me to consider buying the product (score 3). However, I would likely only try it if there was a good deal or promotion (score 1), and at this moment, I do not have a strong intention to purchase it right away (score 2).
