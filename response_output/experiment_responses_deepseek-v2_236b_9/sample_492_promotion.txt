Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad seems to convey a positive message about staying energized and looking one's best, which is generally appealing. However, as someone who is reserved (Disagree with being talkative and outgoing) and not overly concerned with artistic interests (Neutral), the appeal of the ad may be somewhat limited. Nonetheless, it does capture attention with its promise of energy and appearance benefits, hence the middle to slightly higher scores for liking, finding it interesting, believing it's good, and finding it attractive.
- **Purchase intention**: Despite having a generally positive view of the advertisement, as a blue-collar worker who is not particularly outgoing or focused on artistic interests, there may be other priorities in terms of spending. The product seems to cater more towards an image-conscious audience rather than someone with a focus on practical work needs. Therefore, while there's some consideration (score 3) for buying the product and trying it out (score 2), the intention to actually purchase is low (score 1). This reflects a realistic approach to personal spending habits that align more closely with immediate occupational requirements rather than lifestyle enhancements.
