Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately likeable (score 4), interesting to some extent (score 5), but not entirely convincing as a good ad (score 3). However, I do find it visually attractive and appealing (score 6).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is somewhat appealing, my purchase intentions are low. I intend to consider buying the product if other factors like reviews or recommendations align with it (score 3), but I am not immediately inclined to try it out (score 1) nor have a strong intent to buy without further consideration (score 2).
