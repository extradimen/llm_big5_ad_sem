Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is seen as moderately good and attractive (scores 3 and 5), which indicates a neutral to slightly positive view. It's considered interesting enough to catch attention (score 4), but not overwhelmingly so.
- **Purchase intention**: There is some interest in trying out the product (score 1), suggesting curiosity, but it does not necessarily translate into a strong intent to purchase immediately (score 2). The consideration of buying the product is present (score 3), which implies that while the ad has caught attention, there may be other factors such as price or relevance that will influence the final decision.
