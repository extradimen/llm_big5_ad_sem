Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is seen as somewhat interesting and attractive (scoring a 4 and 5 respectively), which aligns with my outgoing nature and agreement that I have an active imagination. However, it's not extremely appealing or good in my view (scores 3 for both "good" and "like"), possibly due to my neutral stance on artistic interests and being generally trusting but also sometimes rude, which might make me more skeptical of claims without strong evidence.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is interesting enough to consider buying the product (score 4), it doesn't strongly convince me to intend a purchase right away (score 2). This could be due to my practical nature as a blue-collar worker who values thoroughness and follows through with plans, but at the same time, I am not overly helpful or unselfish, which might affect how much an ad can persuade me.
