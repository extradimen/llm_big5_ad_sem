Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately appealing and somewhat interesting. The claim that the drink helps stay energized is a positive feature for someone who values thoroughness in their job (score 4 for "I think the ad is interesting" and score 5 for "I find the ad attractive"). However, my skepticism towards trusting claims outright (Disagree with being generally trusting) leads to moderate scores rather than strong agreement.
- **Purchase intention**: While I am not strongly inclined to make immediate plans to follow through with purchasing the product due to my trait of not always following through with plans (Strongly Disagree with making plans and following through), I would still consider it, especially if there is a need for an energy boost in my civil servant role. The scores reflect this moderate interest without strong commitment.
