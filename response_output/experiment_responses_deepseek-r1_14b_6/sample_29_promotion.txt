Alright, let me figure out how to approach this evaluation. So, I'm a 20-29-year-old Chinese male student who's divorced and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are quite mixed but with some strong agrees and disagrees.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to assess my attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each part:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad targets energy and appearance, which are relevant for students with busy schedules. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, maybe I'd appreciate a product that boosts my image and energy. But considering I strongly agree with being reserved, I might not be the most social person looking to enhance my appearance. Plus, I tend to be careless, so maybe I don't pay much attention to such ads. So, maybe a 3 here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The promise of energy and looking good is appealing. However, given that I'm not very into artistic interests or creative stuff, the ad might not grab my attention as someone more outgoing might. Maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: For me to believe it, there needs to be some trust factor. I generally trust others, so maybe the ad could build on that. But without specific proof or details, I'm neutral. So, perhaps a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual appeal and message are important. If the ad is well-designed with an energetic vibe, it might attract me. Since I'm somewhat agreeable but not overly so, maybe a 5.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My income is low, so cost is a big factor. Even if the ad resonates, without knowing the price, I'm hesitant. Maybe a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without trying it, I can't be sure. But considering my tendency towards being careless and sometimes not following through, maybe a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's something that could fit into my routine if affordable. So, maybe a 5.

Overall, I'm leaning towards middle to slightly below average scores for the ad's attitude and lower intentions due to cost concerns.
