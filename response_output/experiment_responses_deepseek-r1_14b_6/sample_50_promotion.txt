Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, I'm highly agreeable in being helpful and unselfish, so the message about looking good might appeal to me on a social level. However, I don't find the ad particularly interesting because it's quite generic. It doesn't stand out enough to capture my attention beyond the surface level. Regarding whether the ad is good, while it has positive messages, it lacks depth and specific benefits that would make it more convincing. Lastly, the attractiveness of the ad is moderate; I don't find it visually compelling or emotionally resonant enough.

Moving on to purchase intention: The drink's claims are tempting, especially since staying energized could be beneficial. However, my thoroughness in making decisions means I wouldn't rush into purchasing without more information. I'm not convinced enough by the ad alone to intend buying it, but the idea isn't dismissed entirely, so trying or considering it is still a possibility.
