Alright, I need to figure out how someone with my given demographic and personality traits would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My background is a blue-collar worker in China, under 20, high school education, with a monthly income of less than 15 million VND. I'm divorced, so maybe family isn't a big focus now.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Outgoing and sociable: Agree. So social interactions are important to me.
- Reserved: Also agree? Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I balance being outgoing in some settings but reserved in others.
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly agree. This makes me consider the impact on others.
- Generally trusting: Strongly disagree. So I'm skeptical of ads' claims.
- Sometimes rude: Disagree. But careful with social interactions.
- Thorough job: Agree. I value quality and might look for detailed info.
- Make plans: Neutral, so not very organized or maybe inconsistent in following through.
- Careless: Strongly agree. I might overlook details.
- Nervous easily: Neutral.
- Worry a lot: Strongly disagree. So not much anxiety but also not carefree.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral.
- Active imagination and original ideas: Agree and strongly agree, so creative and open to new concepts.

Now evaluating the ad:

The ad's main points are energy and looking good daily. As someone who's outgoing, I might appreciate staying energized for socializing. However, being reserved in some contexts, maybe the need to look good isn't a top priority?

Trusting is low, so I'm skeptical of the drink's effectiveness. The claims seem too good—staying energized and looking good every day. That might feel exaggerated or manipulative.

I'm helpful and unselfish, so I'd consider how this product affects others. If it helps me be more active socially, that could positively impact my interactions. But if the drink is expensive, maybe I should save money for other needs.

Creativity is high, but the ad doesn't offer much creative appeal. It's straightforward and might not engage someone like me who enjoys original ideas.

Purchase intention: My income is low, so price matters. If it's affordable, considering buying; if not, probably won't.

Looking at each attitude score:

1. I like the ad. - Hmm, the claims are good but seems too much. Maybe 3/7.
2. Interesting? It has benefits, but maybe not engaging enough. Also a 3.
3. Good: It's functional, but the trust issue makes it lower—maybe 4.
4. Attractive: The design might be okay, but without details,吸引力不大，所以也是3。

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Trust issues and cost concerns—probably 2.
2. Try to buy? Maybe give it a shot if affordable—so 3.
3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, but not sure—maybe 4.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again:

Attitude:
1. Like - The message is positive but feels a bit generic and possibly manipulative due to lack of trust, so maybe 3.
2. Interesting - Not particularly interesting as it's common, so 3.
3. Good - Functionally good but not trustworthy enough—4.
4. Attractive - Maybe neutral on attractiveness, also 3.

Purchase:
1. Intend - No strong reason; maybe 2.
2. Try - Could try once or twice—3.
3. Consider - It's an option but not top priority—maybe 4.

But perhaps I'm being too harsh. The drink could be seen as a way to improve daily life, so maybe higher scores for purchase intention. Alternatively, considering all factors, I might give lower scores because of the trust issue and practical concerns.
