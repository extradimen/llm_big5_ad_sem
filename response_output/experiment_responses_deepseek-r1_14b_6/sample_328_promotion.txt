Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese woman would respond to the ad. Let me break down her profile and traits first.

She's over 60, a civil servant with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning more than 46 million VND a month. That’s a high income, so she can afford premium products. Her personality traits: outgoing but not talkative, helpful, sometimes worries a lot, makes plans and follows through.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and appearance, which are important for someone active and maybe social. Since she's outgoing (agree), she might value looking good and having energy to engage socially.

Her agreement with helpfulness suggests she values products that contribute positively, but the ad is more about personal benefits. She’s neutral on being talkative, so not sure if that affects her response. She tends to make plans and follow through (strongly agree), which makes her someone who values structure and might appreciate a consistent routine around a drink.

She's neutral on imagination/originality but has few artistic interests. The ad is straightforward, focusing on practical benefits like energy and appearance. That might align with her personality more than something creative or imaginative.

Her tendency to worry (agree) could make her cautious about products' claims. She needs evidence that the drink actually works as advertised. Since she's a critical thinker, the ad might not be enough unless there’s some trust built in.

She’s disagree on being thorough, which means maybe she doesn’t take too much time analyzing ads, but given her income level and careful nature in other traits, she could still be discerning.

Putting this together: The ad is positive and aligns with her values of being helpful and outgoing. It offers tangible benefits she can relate to. However, without specific evidence or details about the drink's effectiveness, her cautious side might hold her back from strong purchase intent. She might not feel strongly enough about it to buy immediately but could consider it as part of a routine.

So for attitude towards the ad: she finds it interesting and good because it’s relevant to her needs but maybe doesn't love it (4-5 on like/attractive). For purchase intention, she's considering it but hasn’t made up her mind yet.
