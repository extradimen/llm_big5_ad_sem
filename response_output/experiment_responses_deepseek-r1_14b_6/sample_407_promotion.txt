Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a 50-59-year-old married woman from China with a postgraduate degree and currently a student. My monthly income is between 26,000,000 to 35,000,000 VND. 

Looking at my personality traits:
- I don't like talking much (Strongly Disagree), so ads that require a lot of engagement might not appeal to me.
- I'm reserved and sometimes rude, which could make me less likely to be swayed by social aspects in ads.
- The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look good. As someone who makes plans and follows through (Agree on that), maybe this drink fits into a routine. But I tend to worry a lot and get nervous sometimes, so I might be cautious about health claims.
- I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree) which means ads with lots of creative visuals might not resonate as much.

The ad is short but the key points are energy and looking good. Since I'm in my 50s, staying energized is a plus. But I'm also cautious about health products because of past experiences or general skepticism towards such claims.

For attitude towards the ad:
1. I don't particularly like ads that are too pushy or not relevant to me. This one seems okay but not exciting.
2. Interesting? Not really, it's pretty generic and doesn't stand out.
3. Good? It gets the message across clearly, so maybe a 4.
4. Attractive? The design is simple, not particularly attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Do I intend to buy? Probably not, since there are many similar products and this ad doesn't make it unique.
2. Try it? Maybe if someone else recommends it or offers a sample.
3. Consider buying? Not really, because I don't see enough reason to switch from what I might already use.

So, the scores would be low for attitude towards the ad and even lower for purchase intentions.
