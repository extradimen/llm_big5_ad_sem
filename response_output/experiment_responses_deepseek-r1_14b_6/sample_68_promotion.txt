Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores based on my demographic and personality traits.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   My personality leans towards being reserved (Agree) and sometimes rude (Strongly Agree). However, the ad's message about energy and looking good is positive but might not resonate as much due to my reserved nature. So, I'm Neutral.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. My active imagination and originality make me open to creative ideas, so this ad could be seen as interesting. I'll give it a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   Trust is an issue here since I'm Strongly Disagree on trusting people. The ad's claims feel generic without specific evidence, making it hard for me to fully trust its message. A 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Being reserved and not very outgoing, ads that are too flashy might not appeal as much. However, the positive imagery could still attract me a bit, so Neutral again.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   My monthly income is high, but I'm cautious with spending. The ad's claims lack specific benefits and don't address health concerns or long-term effects, which makes me hesitant. So, Neutral.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Even though I have the means, without strong trust in the product or compelling evidence, trying it isn't a priority. Another Neutral.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Given my income and cautious nature, considering might happen if there's more information, but as it stands, it's on the fence. So, a 4 here.
