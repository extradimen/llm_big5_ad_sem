Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese male under 20 with the given personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - Considering the traits, I'm outgoing but also reserved, which might make me mixed feelings about ads that target social image. Since I worry a bit less (score 4), maybe I don't find it too compelling. Neutral on this, so around 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message is clear and plays on looking good and feeling energetic, which could appeal to someone my age. But since I'm not thoroughly convinced, maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The content seems straightforward but doesn't wow me with originality or creativity. Neutral again, so 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - It's simple and addresses social concerns, which might make it somewhat attractive. Maybe a 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - I'm more careless (strongly agree) but also think through things (strongly disagree on thoroughness). So, low intent, perhaps a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without strong motivation, maybe not much intention, so 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's something I might think about if the need arises, but not a priority. Maybe a 4.
