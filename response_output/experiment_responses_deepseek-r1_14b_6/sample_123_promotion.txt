Alright, let me try to figure out how to score this advertisement. So, the ad is about a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. I need to evaluate it based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, looking at my demographics: I'm from China, male, under 20, a postgraduate student, married, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. As a student, maybe I have limited funds, so cost might be a factor. But since it's a drink aimed at daily use, perhaps the price is reasonable.

Personality-wise, I'm not talkative or outgoing; I'm somewhat reserved. However, I find myself helpful and trusting, which might make me more open to health-related products. I get nervous easily but am emotionally stable, which could mean I'm cautious about what I buy. I have an active imagination but don't consider myself original or creative, and I strongly agree that I have few artistic interests.

The ad's main points are energy and looking good. For a student, staying energized is important for studies and daily activities. The "look your best" part might appeal to me if it relates to feeling better about my appearance, which could boost confidence.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad: Do I connect with the message? It's positive, but maybe a bit generic. Not sure if it's enough to make me like it.
2. Interesting: The idea of combining energy and looking good is catchy, but without specific details, it might not hold my interest much.
3. Good: Does it effectively convey its message? It seems too vague; perhaps more specifics about benefits would make it better.
4. Attractive: The visual appeal depends on the ad's presentation. If it's colorful and dynamic, maybe I find it attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Not sure yet. More information is needed to convince me.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if I see others using it or hear more about its benefits.
3. Consider buying: It depends on availability and price; if it's affordable, I might think about trying it.

I'm a bit torn because while the ad targets something important for students, the lack of specific details makes me unsure. My reserved nature and tendency to get nervous might make me cautious about trying new products without more information.
