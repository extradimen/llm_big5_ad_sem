Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, the ad is about a drink that prevents tiredness and dull looks. As a civil servant in my late 40s, staying alert and looking presentable is important for both work and social interactions.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad.** - I'm somewhat interested because it addresses real concerns about energy and appearance, but the message feels a bit generic. So, maybe a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's not particularly compelling or creative, so around a 3.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - I don't find it convincing since it doesn't offer specific benefits or evidence. Maybe a 4.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visuals might be okay, but nothing stands out. So, another 3.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Not sure yet; I'd need more info on effectiveness. Probably a 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Maybe if it's recommended by others or has good reviews, so perhaps a 4.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on my radar, but not top priority. A 5 makes sense.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly persuade me, but it does make me think about the product in certain contexts.
