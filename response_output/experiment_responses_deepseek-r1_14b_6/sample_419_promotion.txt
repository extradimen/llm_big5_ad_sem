Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad itself: The drink is advertised as helping to stay energized and look your best every day. Given my personality traits, I'm reserved (strongly agree) and helpful but neutral on being unselfish. I'm also someone who worries a lot (agree), which might make me cautious about health products.

For the ad attitude:
1. Like: The message seems positive, but since I'm not very outgoing or talkative, maybe it doesn't resonate as much. So a 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, so not particularly interesting to me. A 4.
3. Good: The claims are okay, but nothing stands out. A 4.
4. Attractive: The ad might not appeal visually since I'm reserved and not focused on looks. A 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Not sure if it's effective; need more info. So a 3.
2. Try: Maybe if others recommend, but not eager. Another 3.
3. Consider: Would think about it, so a 4.

Overall, the scores reflect cautious consideration without strong positive feelings.
