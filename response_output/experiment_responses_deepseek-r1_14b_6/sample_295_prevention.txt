Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their background: They're a married blue-collar worker in China, aged 30-39, with a bachelor's degree and a high income. Personality-wise, they are outgoing, trusting, helpful, but not talkative. They make thorough plans, aren't careless, and have strong emotional stability but worry a lot.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad. - The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since they're outgoing and care about their image, this might appeal to them. They value being sociable, so not wanting to look dull could resonate. However, as a blue-collar worker, maybe they prioritize practicality over appearance. So, maybe a 4.

2. I think the ad is interesting. - The message is straightforward but might not be very engaging. It's a common concern, but without emotional appeal or creativity, it might get a 3.

3. I believe the ad is good. - For them to believe it, the ad needs to connect with their concerns. Since they worry a lot and value trust, if the ad seems credible, maybe a 4. But if it's too generic, perhaps lower.

4. I find the ad attractive. - Attractiveness depends on emotional appeal. The message is about looking good and feeling energetic, which might not deeply attract someone who isn't focused on appearances but values trust. Maybe a 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - They are methodical and planful, so if the ad makes them believe it's effective, they might intend to buy. However, their income is high, so maybe not necessary for them? A 4.

2. I will try to buy this product. - If convinced of its benefits, they might be willing to try once. Maybe a 5.

3. I will consider buying this product. - Given their thoughtful nature, they would likely consider it as part of their planning. So, a solid 6.
