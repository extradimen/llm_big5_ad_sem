Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is trying to create a sense of fear about looking tired and dull without their drink. It's not really appealing to me because it feels more negative than positive. So, I'd give it a 2.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** While the message is clear, it doesn't really grab my interest much. It's pretty straightforward, so maybe a 3 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The ad does make me think about the consequences of not having the drink, but I don't feel convinced by the message. So, a 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals and message are okay, but it's not particularly captivating. A 3 feels right.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Since I don't feel strongly about needing this drink, my intention isn't high. A 2 makes sense.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's some consideration because the ad does make me think about fatigue, but without a strong emotional hook, it's a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** The ad introduces the idea, so I might think about it in the future, hence a 4.
