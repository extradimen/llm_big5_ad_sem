Alright, let me break down my thought process for evaluating this advertisement. 

First, I need to understand the ad itself: it's promoting a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. So, the key selling points are energy and appearance.

Looking at my demographic profile, I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese student who is currently divorced, has a bachelor's degree, and a monthly income below 15 million VND. My personality traits include being reserved (strongly agree), sometimes rude to others (agree), having an active imagination and originality (agree), but also disagreeing with being helpful, trusting, and following through on plans.

Now, considering the ad: it targets energy levels and daily appearance. Since I'm a student, staying energized could be appealing, especially during exam periods or busy days. However, my personality traits play a role too. 

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: The drink's benefits are positive, but as someone who is reserved and sometimes rude, I might not connect emotionally with overly cheerful ads. Plus, being original, I might find the ad a bit generic. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The idea of looking your best every day is appealing, especially for students who want to present well. But since I'm not very outgoing, the ad's message might not resonate as much. Maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: To evaluate if it's good, I consider credibility. The claims are common but lack specific evidence. My tendency to be doubtful (strongly disagree with trusting) makes me question the product's effectiveness. So, perhaps a 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The promise of looking good and being energized is tempting, especially if the ad uses appealing visuals. However, my reserved nature might not lead me to strongly agree. Maybe a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My cautious nature (disagree with trusting) makes me hesitant. Plus, I don't have a strong need for such products. A 2 here.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some appeal, but without seeing it in action or getting more info, trying it might be low on my priority list. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's something I might think about if I see it recommended elsewhere or have the need for energy boosts. So, a 4 seems right.
