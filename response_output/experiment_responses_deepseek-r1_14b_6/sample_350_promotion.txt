Okay, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement. So, the ad is saying that a drink can help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let's break this down based on my background and personality.

First, I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. That might mean I have a busy schedule, possibly physically demanding work, so the idea of something that keeps me energized is appealing. Plus, looking good every day could be important for both personal and professional reasons.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm reserved (strongly agree), which means I might not be easily swayed by overly enthusiastic ads. I do a thorough job (strongly agree), so I probably want to know more details about the product before deciding. I have an active imagination and am original, coming up with new ideas, which could make me open to creative marketing but also makes me critical of what's being sold.

I'm disagreeable in terms of being helpful and trusting, which might make me more skeptical of claims that seem too good to be true. I get nervous easily (agree), so any ad that feels manipulative or over the top might bother me. Also, I don't worry a lot but am not emotionally stable, so maybe stress about decisions.

The ad's message is about energy and looking good. For someone my age, staying energized could be a big plus, especially if work is tiring. The "look your best" part might appeal to my desire for personal presentation, which could be important in professional settings.

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: Since I'm reserved, I might not love it, but the benefits are appealing. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The idea is somewhat appealing but maybe not very compelling. Perhaps a 5.
3. Good: It makes some positive claims, but without evidence, it's hard to say. Maybe a 6? Or lower?
Wait, I'm skeptical because of my disagreeable side. So maybe the ad isn't that good in terms of trustworthiness. Maybe a 4.
4. Attractive: The message is nice, but if the ad feels too pushy or lacks detail, it might not be very attractive. Perhaps a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I need more info and trust. Probably a low score, maybe 3?
2. Try to buy: Maybe neutral since I'm considering it but not sure. Maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, so maybe a higher score, like a 5.

Wait, let me recheck the scores based on the scale (1-7). If "I like" is 4, then that's moderately agree. But considering I'm reserved and need more info, maybe it's lower.

Alternatively, if the ad feels too generic or lacks specifics, my trust issues might make me less likely to be interested. So perhaps:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3 (Mildly like)
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 3 (Not great without evidence)
4. Attractive: 5 (Somewhat)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 4 (Maybe, but not sure)
2. Try to buy: 5 (Possibly)
3. Consider: 6 (On my list)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Considering all factors:

- The ad's claims are positive but vague.
- My personality is skeptical and reserved.
- I value thoroughness, so I need more details to trust it.
- The benefits align with potential needs (energy for work, looking good).

So maybe the ad isn't very appealing because of lack of evidence. But the idea is somewhat interesting.

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: Maybe 5 if I think it's trying to help, but skeptical so perhaps lower.
Wait, maybe 3 for like, 4 for interesting, 6 for good? Or no, since I'm disagreeing on helpfulness.

Hmm, this is tricky. Perhaps the ad isn't particularly good because it's too vague and relies on trust, which I don't have much of. So:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 4, 3, 4]
Purchase intention: Maybe not intending to buy immediately, but might consider after more info.

So purchase:
1. Intend: 3 (Probably not)
2. Try: 4 (Maybe if reminded again)
3. Consider: 5 (Possibly in the future)

Wait, I'm still uncertain. Maybe higher scores for considering because the benefits are relevant to me, but lower for actual intent due to lack of trust.

So perhaps:

Ad attitude: [3,4,4,5]
Purchase intention: [3,4,5]

But I'm not sure if 5 is right for consider buying. Alternatively, maybe a 6 because it's somewhat appealing despite skepticism.
