Alright, let's break this down. I'm a male student from China, under 20, living with my parents and earning around 16-25 million VND a month. My personality traits show that I'm reserved, helpful but neutral, trusting but sometimes rude, thorough, not great at following plans, careless, a bit nervous and worried, not very imaginative, not original, and have few artistic interests.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So, let's think about how I would respond to this.

First, my attitude towards the ad:

1. Like the ad: The ad seems straightforward but might not appeal much because I'm reserved and not very imaginative. It doesn't grab me emotionally or creatively. Maybe a 2.
   
2. Interesting: Not particularly. The message is common and lacks originality. So maybe a 3.

3. Good: It's functional, but since I don't prioritize looking my best as much, it might not seem good to me. A 4 seems fair.

4. Attractive: Since I'm not into artistic things, the ad's visuals might not attract me. Another 2.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Not really, because I don't feel energized issues are a big concern for me. Maybe a 3.

2. Try to buy: Same as above, so another 3.

3. Consider buying: If it's affordable and convenient, maybe I'll think about it. So perhaps a 4.
