Okay, let me break down how I arrived at my scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the ad itself: The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

I considered my personality traits first. I'm a high school student who's talkative but not very outgoing. I tend to be reserved, which means I might not pay much attention to ads that are meant for more social people. However, the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull could resonate with me because as a student, staying alert and presentable is important.

Looking at my traits:
- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Disagree
- Reserved: Strongly disagree

But despite being reserved, I'm emotionally stable (Agree) and have an active imagination (Disagree), but I do come up with new ideas (Agree). However, the ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull. Since I'm not outgoing, maybe I don't feel the need to look as lively all the time, so the fear appeal might not hit me as hard.

Regarding my tendency to make thorough plans (Strongly Agree) but also being careless (Strongly Agree), this could mean that while I plan, sometimes things slip through. The ad's message about prevention makes senseâ€”preventing tiredness and looking dull by using their drink.

Now, evaluating the ad attitude:
1. I like the ad: 3/7 because it's a bit fear-based, but not entirely off-putting.
2. Interesting: 4/7; it's a common message but presented in an engaging way.
3. Good: 5/7; it effectively communicates the product's benefit without being too pushy.
4. Attractive: 3/7; the message is clear, but maybe not visually appealing or unique.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: 2/7 because while the ad makes me think about it, I'm not sure if it's necessary yet.
2. Try to buy: 4/7; if others recommend it or if I feel more tired, I might consider trying it.
3. Consider buying: 5/7; the ad does make me think that this drink could be useful for certain situations.

Overall, the scores reflect a cautious consideration without strong emotional appeal, but enough to make me think about the product.
