Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: They're from China, male, in their 50s, with a bachelor's degree and a high income of 26-35 million VND per month. He's divorced, which might influence his lifestyle choices or social habits.

Looking at their personality traits:

1. Talkative: Strongly Disagree – So he's not someone who enjoys chatting a lot.
2. Outgoing/Sociable: Agree – He's somewhat sociable but not overly so.
3. Reserved: Strongly Agree – This seems contradictory because being outgoing and reserved can be conflicting, but perhaps he balances it.
4. Helpful/Unselfish: Disagree – Doesn't see himself as very helpful or unselfish.
5. Trusting: Strongly Disagree – He's not trusting of others.
6. Sometimes Rude: Neutral – No strong feelings either way about being rude.
7. Thorough Job: Strongly Disagree – He doesn't do things thoroughly.
8. Plans and Follows Through: Disagree – Not good at making plans or following them.
9. Careless: Disagree – He's not careless.
10. Nervous Easily: Strongly Disagree – He's calm under pressure.
11. Worry a Lot: Strongly Agree – He tends to worry a lot.
12. Emotionally Stable: Disagree – His emotional stability is low.
13. Active Imagination: Agree – He has an active imagination.
14. Original/New Ideas: Agree – He's good at coming up with new ideas.
15. Few Artistic Interests: Disagree – He has some artistic interests.

Now, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key messages here are about feeling tired and looking dull without the product. So it's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable.

Considering his personality, he's not talkative or outgoing in a big way, but somewhat sociable. He's reserved, so maybe he values personal space or doesn't seek social interactions much. Being helpful is low, so perhaps he's more self-focused.

He worries a lot (strongly agrees) and has an active imagination, which might make him susceptible to ads that tap into his fears of looking dull or feeling tired, especially if it affects his image in social settings. However, he doesn't trust others much and isn't very thorough, so the ad's message needs to be clear but not overly persuasive.

The ad is a prevention-focused message, which might align with someone who wants to avoid negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull). But since he's also not very trusting or helpful, he might be cautious about the product's effectiveness. His active imagination could make him imagine scenarios where using the drink helps him maintain his image despite his reserved nature.

For purchase intention: He's somewhat sociable but not outgoing, so maybe the ad's message resonates with him if he values looking good and being energetic in social interactions. However, since he doesn't plan well or follow through on plans, he might not be someone who acts impulsively on ads. His high income suggests he can afford such products, but his skepticism might make him cautious.

Looking at ad attitude: He's reserved and not very trusting, so the ad needs to appeal without being too pushy. The message about looking dull could hit him where he's worried (worry a lot – strongly agrees). So, he might find it interesting because it addresses his worries, but since he doesn't like being talked into things, he might not strongly like the ad.

For purchase intention: He's not careless and tends to worry, so if the product seems reliable, he might consider buying it. But given that he's not someone who follows through on plans easily, maybe his consideration is low unless convinced.

So, putting it together:

- Ad attitude scores: He finds it somewhat interesting because of the worry aspect but doesn't strongly like it or find it good.
- Purchase intention: He might consider buying it if convinced, but isn't likely to intend to buy immediately.

Wait, that seems a bit conflicting. Let me adjust.

He's more interested in prevention and avoiding negative outcomes (tiredness, looking dull). His high income means he can afford such products, so maybe the ad is somewhat attractive because it addresses his concerns. But since he's not trusting or helpful, the ad might not be very persuasive to him on a deeper level.

Perhaps:

Ad attitude: He finds it interesting and good but doesn't strongly like it or find it attractive.
Purchase intention: He may consider buying it if convinced, but isn't highly intent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think numerically.

On the 7-point scale:

1. Like the ad: Since he's reserved and not trusting, maybe a middle score. Maybe around 3 or 4.
2. Interesting: The message might be interesting due to addressing his worries, so maybe higher, like 5.
3. Good: It's a prevention message, which could be seen as good but not necessarily great, so maybe 4.
4. Attractive: Since he's reserved and the ad is pushing social image, perhaps it's not very attractive to him, maybe around 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He might not have a strong intent unless convinced, maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe a bit higher than intend because of the message, say 4.
3. Consider buying: He might be more likely to consider it, so perhaps 5.

Wait, but he's in his 50s, which is a different demographic for such products. Maybe they target younger people more, so this could affect his perception negatively, lowering scores further.

Alternatively, maybe the ad addresses real concerns for him, making it somewhat appealing despite his skepticism.

I think I need to finalize the scores based on these considerations.
