Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, I'm helpful, thorough, and trust others, which makes me more likely to appreciate ads that offer positive benefits. However, being reserved might make me less enthusiastic about it. So, I scored 4 on liking it but found it a bit neutral otherwise.

For purchase intention: While the ad appeals to my desire for well-being, being careful and sometimes careless makes me cautious about trying new products. Plus, considering my income level, I'm more budget-conscious, so intent is low, but I might consider it if there's a good deal.
