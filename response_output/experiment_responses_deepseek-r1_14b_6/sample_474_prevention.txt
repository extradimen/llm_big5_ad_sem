Okay, I'm a man from China, aged between 50-59, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My income is pretty decent, around 16 to 25 million VND monthly. I'm divorced, which might affect my lifestyle choices and preferences.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message here seems to be about energy and appearance. Since I'm in my mid-50s, staying alert and looking good could be important, especially if I'm active or have social engagements. But considering my reserved nature and tendency towards being careless, maybe the ad isn't hitting the right notes for me.

I don't like talking much (strongly disagree), so ads that rely on social interaction might not appeal. Plus, I find myself sometimes rude to others, which could make me less responsive to messages that push social benefits. The ad seems a bit manipulative, playing on fears of tiredness and looking bad, which feels a bit too pushy.

I agree with being thorough but also tend to be careless. So while the product might have some value, the way it's presented doesn't resonate with me. My emotional stability is neutral, so I'm not overly swayed by such ads. Also, having few artistic interests and not being original makes me less likely to connect with creative or innovative ad messages.

For purchase intention, even though the message touches on tiredness, which could be a real issue, my tendency towards carelessness might make me overlook it. Plus, I'm not convinced the ad is genuine enough to make me try or consider buying the product.
