Okay, I'm a 25-year-old single female working as a civil servant in China. My monthly income is between 26 million and 35 million VND. I have high school education and am generally trusting but sometimes rude. I don't plan much, tend to be careless, get nervous easily, worry not too much, find it hard to imagine things, and don't come up with new ideas.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, does this ad appeal to me? The message seems to target someone who wants to stay energized and look good. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe I value looking professional. But I don't see myself as someone who gets tired easily or cares too much about appearances beyond that.

The ad's tone is direct and warns about the negative effects of not using the drink. Itâ€™s trying to create fear of missing out on energy and attractiveness. However, my personality traits suggest I might not be highly motivated by such messages. I'm not particularly trusting of ads that make strong claims without evidence. Plus, I sometimes feel annoyed by ads that push too hard.

Regarding purchase intention: The ad makes a point about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. If I were to feel tired often, maybe this could be a solution. But considering my income is on the higher side, I might look for more expensive or established brands rather than something like this. Also, I don't make thorough plans, so if an ad suggests a quick fix, it might not resonate enough to drive me to purchase.

I'm emotionally stable but sometimes get nervous, which the drink could potentially help with. However, without seeing any evidence or knowing more about the product's benefits, my inclination is low. Plus, I find ads that are too pushy a bit off-putting.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: It's clear and to the point, but the fear-based approach doesn't really speak to me. I might not like it because it feels manipulative. The idea of feeling tired without the drink is relatable, but the way it's presented seems a bit too intense.

So overall, while the message touches on something relevant (energy and appearance), my personality and skepticism towards such ads make me less likely to be swayed. Purchase intention isn't high because I don't see enough reason to choose this product over others.
