Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Since I'm a person who values being energetic and present, this could resonate. However, the way it's presented might be too generic, so my score is 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: It's a common message, so not particularly interesting. I'd give it a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The claims are standard and lack specific evidence, so I'm neutral with a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visuals might be appealing, but without specifics, it's just average. Another 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Without strong personal motivation or evidence, my intent is low, so 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Maybe if others recommend it, I might consider a trial. That's a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's on the edge; without more info, consideration isn't strong. So another 3.
