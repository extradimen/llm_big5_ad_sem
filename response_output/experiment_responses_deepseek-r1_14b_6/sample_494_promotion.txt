Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographics and personality traits of the person evaluating the ad is crucial. The individual is a 40-49-year-old Chinese male with a high school education, currently a student, and has a monthly income under 15 million VND. He's divorced, which might affect his priorities regarding health or personal image. His personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, but sometimes careless, emotionally stable, and having an active imagination.

Starting with the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key promises here are energy and looking good daily. For someone in their 40s, staying energetic might be appealing as they balance studies (he's a student) and possibly other responsibilities. Looking good could also be important for confidence or social interactions.

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. - The message is positive and aspirational. It resonates with the desire to feel good and look good. However, being in his 40s, he might not immediately connect with "looking your best" as much as someone younger might. So maybe a 5.

2. I think the ad is interesting. - The ad is concise but doesn't provide specific details about how it works or what makes it effective. It's catchy but might lack depth for him to find it truly interesting. Maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good. - Belief in the ad depends on trust. His personality trait shows he generally disagrees with being trusting, so he might be skeptical of such claims without evidence. A 4 seems fair here.

4. I find the ad attractive. - The imagery and messaging could be appealing if it's well-designed, but his tendency to get nervous or worry might make him question the ad's sincerity. Maybe a 5.

Next, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - Intention is low because he's more of a student with limited income. Unless he has specific needs or trust issues, he might not feel compelled to buy it immediately. A 3.

2. I will try to buy this product. - Trying the product might be influenced by curiosity, especially if the ad reaches him through social media or other platforms where he engages. Maybe a 4.

3. I will consider buying this product. - Given his helpful nature and desire for energy, he might think about it as a possible option when considering health drinks. A 5 seems reasonable.

Overall, while the ad is positive and somewhat appealing, his personality traits like being cautious (disagree with trusting), sometimes careless, and having an active imagination but also agreeing to worry a bit make him less likely to be immediately swayed. His limited income might also hinder purchase intent.
