Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding my background: I'm from China, male, in my late 20s, have a postgraduate degree, but not working in a typical job (maybe something else), divorced, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income, so I can afford premium products.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing, which means I value social interactions and might be interested in products that enhance my appearance or energy because those things are important in social settings. I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe I care about how products can benefit others too. I tend to trust people but also get nervous easily, which could make me cautious about new products.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance. Since I'm outgoing, looking good is important for social interactions. Staying energized would help me maintain my active lifestyle and perhaps handle stress better.

Now, evaluating each attitude score:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, it's short and to the point. It targets two main benefits—energy and appearance—which are relevant to someone my age who is socially active. So maybe a 5 because it's okay but not particularly exciting.
   
2. Is it interesting? The message is clear but might feel too generic. Maybe a 4 since it doesn't stand out much.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It delivers its message effectively, so probably a 5.

4. Find the ad attractive? Attractiveness depends on visuals and creativity. If the ad has appealing visuals, maybe a 6; if not, perhaps lower. Let's say 5 for now.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Since I can afford it and the benefits align with my lifestyle, maybe a 6. It's a consideration but not an immediate purchase.

2. Will try to buy: Similar to above, I might look for promotions or discounts before buying, so perhaps a 5.

3. Consider buying: Definitely on my radar, so a 7 because it's something I would think about purchasing.

Wait, let me adjust. Since the ad is focused on energy and appearance, which are important to me, maybe the scores should be higher. So perhaps:

Ad attitude scores: [6,5,6,6] for like, interesting, good, attractive.

Purchase intention: [6,6,7].

But I'm not sure if I'm overestimating. Maybe the ad's generic nature doesn't make it extremely likable or interesting. So maybe lower the first two:

Ad attitude scores: [5,4,5,5]

Purchase intention: [6,6,7].

Hmm, but since I do value these benefits highly, perhaps I should rate the purchase intentions higher. Let me settle on:

Ad态度评分：[6,5,6,6]

购买意图评分：[6,6,7]
