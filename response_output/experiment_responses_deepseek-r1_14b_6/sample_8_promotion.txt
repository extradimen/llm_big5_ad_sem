Alright, I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let me start by understanding her background and personality.

She's from China, over 60, living with parents, has a postgraduate degree but is in another occupation, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. She's reserved, helpful, generally trusting but sometimes rude. She does thorough work, makes plans, worries a lot, gets nervous easily, isn't emotionally stable, and lacks artistic interests.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best daily.

For her attitude towards the ad:

1. **Like the ad**: The ad is positive, which might appeal to someone looking for energy. But she's reserved and maybe not into energetic products. She might not like it much.
2. **Interesting**: The benefits are clear but perhaps too generic. Maybe neutral.
3. **Good**: It seems functional, but without specific details, she might not find it good.
4. **Attractive**: Being reserved and not into energetic stuff, maybe not attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy**: She's careful with spending, so unless convinced, probably low intent.
2. **Try to buy**: Maybe neutral; unsure if the ad's enough reason.
3. **Consider buying**: If she worries about health, might consider but not sure.

So scores would be low for attitude and purchase intention.
