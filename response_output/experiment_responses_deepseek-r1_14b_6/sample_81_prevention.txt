Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude towards myself:

1. **I like the ad (score 5):** The ad targets tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable issues for many people, especially after a long day. However, the message is quite generic and doesn't stand out to me as someone who values originality. Plus, it feels a bit manipulative because it's implying that without this drink, I might not be presentable, which could play into insecurities but in an overused way.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score 5):** It touches on real feelings, so it's somewhat interesting. But it doesn't capture my attention completely because it's a common theme and lacks creativity or unique angles that might engage someone with a high imagination like me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score 4):** While the message is clear, I don't feel it's particularly well-crafted. It lacks depth or emotional appeal, which are important for an advertisement to be truly effective in my eyes.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score 5):** The visuals and messaging might attract some people, but not me personally. It doesn't resonate with my values or lifestyle enough to feel genuinely attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (score 2):** I'm skeptical about the effectiveness of such products. Without concrete evidence or a compelling reason beyond just looking tired, it's hard for me to see myself buying it.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score 3):** If someone else sways me or if I'm in a situation where I feel compelled by the ad's message, I might consider trying it once. But there's no strong motivation pushing me towards it.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score 4):** While I don't have immediate plans to buy, if the product is recommended or if my circumstances change, I could be open to considering it. However, the ad alone isn't enough to make me seriously think about purchasing.
