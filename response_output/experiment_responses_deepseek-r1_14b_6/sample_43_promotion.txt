Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement for the drink. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, understanding the demographic and personality traits. The person is a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman working as a civil servant with a bachelor's degree, married, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. She has outgoing and helpful traits but tends to be nervous and worried. She does thorough work but isn't very good at sticking to plans and is somewhat careless.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For her attitude toward the advertisement, I need to consider if she likes it, finds it interesting, thinks it's good, and finds it attractive. Since she's talkative and outgoing, maybe she relates to the energetic aspect, but being a civil servant, perhaps she values looking presentable. However, she gets nervous easily and worries a lot, so an ad focusing on daily energy might resonate with her need for stamina and appearance.

Now, purchase intention: Does she intend to buy, try, or consider it? She's helpful and thorough, which might make her more inclined to trust the product's benefits. But since she sometimes doesn't follow through with plans and can be careless, maybe she wouldn't prioritize buying it immediately but would think about it.

Scores:
1. Like: 4 - Neutral. She might not strongly like or dislike.
2. Interesting: 5 - Agree a bit. The idea of staying energized is appealing.
3. Good: 5 - Agree. It seems beneficial, especially for her job.
4. Attractive: 6 - Strongly agree. The message is positive and relevant.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 4 - Neutral. She might not be sure yet.
2. Try: 5 - Agree. If it's good, she might give it a shot.
3. Consider: 5 - Agree. It's on her radar.

So the scores would reflect moderate positive feelings towards the ad and some consideration for purchase but not immediate action.
