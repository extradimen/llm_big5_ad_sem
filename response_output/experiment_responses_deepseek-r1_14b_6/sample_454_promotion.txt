Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my background. I'm a male student from China under 20, making around 16-25 million VND a month. My personality is reserved, sometimes rude, worry a lot, but original with new ideas. I don't find myself outgoing or talkative.

Looking at the ad's message: It focuses on energy and looking good daily. These are pretty common selling points for beverages aimed at busy individuals, maybe students like me who need to stay alert and presentable.

Now, considering my personality traits:

1. **Reserved**: The ad is energetic, which might not align with my reserved nature. I'm more of a listener than someone jumping into things.
2. **Sometimes rude**: The ad's tone is positive and encouraging, so that doesn't directly relate to this trait. But maybe the directness could be seen as similar to being rude?
3. **Worry a lot**: If the drink claims it helps you look your best every day, I might worry about its effectiveness or if there are any hidden downsides.
4. **Original and new ideas**: The ad is pretty generic. It doesn't present anything unique or innovative that would catch my interest as someone who values originality.

Looking at how this aligns with the ad's message, it seems a bit too upbeat for me. I might not find it interesting or appealing because it doesn't cater to my more introverted and cautious nature. Plus, since I'm already in high school and perhaps don't have many social circles where looking "best" is a priority every day.

As for purchase intention: The ad's claims are broad but lack specifics. Without knowing the drink's ingredients or benefits, it's hard to trust it fully. My tendency to worry makes me skeptical of quick fixes. Also, my reserved nature might make me less likely to seek out such products unless I'm convinced they're necessary.

So, evaluating each point:

- **Ad Attitude**: It's not something I'd like or find interesting because it doesn't resonate with my personality. I don't think it's good because it seems generic and possibly manipulative. It might be a bit attractive but not enough to change my opinion.
  
- **Purchase Intention**: I wouldn't intend to buy it, nor would I try or consider buying it unless something changes my perception.

I need to translate these feelings into scores on the 7-point scale. "Like" and "interesting" get low scores, while "attractive" might be slightly higher but still not convincing. For purchase intention, all three aspects are low because there's no compelling reason for me to act based on this ad.
