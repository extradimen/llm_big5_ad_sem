Alright, let me break down my thought process here. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. I'm divorced, which might influence my spending habits or how I perceive ads targeting individuals.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points are energy and appearance, which could appeal to someone looking to maintain vitality, perhaps in their professional life or social circles. Since I'm middle-aged, these aspects might resonate as concerns about staying active and looking good.

My personality traits play a big role here. I'm reserved (strongly agree) but also have an active imagination and come up with new ideas (agree). However, I tend to disagree on being talkative or outgoing. This makes me more of an introspective person who might not be easily swayed by overly enthusiastic ads.

I worry a lot (strongly agree), which could make me cautious about the product's claims. The ad seems too good to be true—helping with both energy and appearance. I'm skeptical because it's making two significant promises without any evidence shown.

I don't do thorough jobs (strongly disagree) and tend to be careless (disagree). This might mean I'm not as detail-oriented when considering purchases, but my high income suggests I can afford more expensive or higher-quality products if convinced.

Thinking about purchase intention: I'm a bit skeptical because of the ad's broad claims. Without specific evidence or clear benefits explained, it's hard to justify spending money on this drink. Plus, with a busy schedule and other priorities post-divorce, I might not prioritize this product unless there's a strong reason.

For attitude toward the ad: It's interesting (agree) because the concept is appealing, but I don't like it much (disagree). I don't think it's particularly good or attractive either—maybe neutral on those fronts. So my scores would reflect that the ad isn't very persuasive to me despite its positive message.
