Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (2/7):** The ad focuses on energy and looking good, which might appeal to someone active. However, considering my personality traits, I'm more reserved and helpful but also tend to worry a lot. The ad doesn't directly address emotional stability or trust, so it's not very engaging for me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7):** The idea of staying energized is somewhat appealing, especially given my active imagination and originality. However, without specific details on how the drink achieves these benefits, it feels a bit vague and thus less interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (3/7):** While the message is positive, there's a lack of evidence or specifics about the product's ingredients or benefits. This makes me skeptical and less likely to strongly agree that the ad is good.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (2/7):** The visuals might be appealing, but the core message doesn't resonate with my values. I'm more focused on practicality and trustworthiness rather than looking my best every day.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7):** There's a slight interest because staying energized is important, especially for someone who makes thorough plans. However, without concrete reasons or benefits highlighted in the ad, my intent isn't strong.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (2/7):** The ad doesn't provide enough incentive or evidence to convince me to try it out. I'm more cautious and tend to worry about purchases without sufficient information.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (4/7):** While I'm not immediately convinced, the idea of staying energized does have some appeal. I might think about it if there are more details or recommendations, but it's a middle-of-the-road consideration.
