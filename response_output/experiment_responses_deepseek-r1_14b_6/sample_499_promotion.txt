Alright, let me break down how I would approach evaluating this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. 

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting someone looking for energy and a way to improve their appearance daily.

Looking at my background: I'm a Chinese male under 20, working as a civil servant, married, with a monthly income between 36 million and 45 million VND. That's a decent income, so maybe the price isn't too much of an issue, but I'm still in high school, which might affect my purchasing habits.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing (Agree), helpful (Neutral), not very trusting (Disagree), and someone who does thorough work (Strongly Agree). I also tend to worry a lot (Agree) and get nervous easily (Disagree).

So for the ad's attitude:
1. I like the ad. - Since I'm outgoing, maybe I'm more interested in products that help me look good and stay energized, which could be appealing.
2. Interesting? The idea of looking your best every day is something people care about, so it might catch my attention.
3. Is it a good ad? Well, the claims are straightforward but don't provide evidence or details. I'm detail-oriented, so lacking specifics might make me question its credibility.
4. Attractive? Maybe, but without seeing visuals or knowing more, it's hard to say. It could be average.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: The ad makes a good case, but without trust and details, I'm not sure.
2. Try to buy: If I can get more info or if friends recommend it, maybe I'd try it.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, especially since my income allows for such expenses, but I need more reasons to actually make the purchase.

So scores might reflect moderate interest and consideration without a strong intent yet.
