Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding my background: I'm from China, female, under 20, have a bachelor’s degree, work as a blue-collar worker, live with parents, and make over 46 million VND monthly. Wait, that income seems extremely high for someone under 20 in Vietnam? Maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with the info given.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Agree (7)
- Outgoing/sociable: Strongly Agree (7)
- Reserved: Agree (4) – Hmm, conflicting. I'm outgoing but also agree to being reserved.
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree (1)
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree (1)
- Sometimes rude: Disagree (3)
- Thorough job: Agree (5)
- Make plans/follow through: Neutral (4)
- Careless: Strongly Agree (7)
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Disagree (1)
- Worry a lot: Neutral (4)
- Emotionally stable: Neutral (4)
- Active imagination: Agree (6)
- Original/new ideas: Agree (6)
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree (1)

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

So, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - Being outgoing and talkative, but also somewhat reserved. The ad is positive, but I'm not sure if it appeals to me since I don't prioritize looking my best daily as much as energy might be a concern.

2. Interesting.
   - Given that I have an active imagination and original ideas, the idea of something helping with both energy and appearance could be interesting. Maybe a 5?

3. Good.
   - The message is clear but maybe too generic. Since I'm not very trusting, I might question if it's effective.

4. Attractive.
   - If the ad has visuals that appeal to an energetic lifestyle, it could attract me. But without knowing the visuals, hard to say, maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - I'm careless but also make thorough plans sometimes. The product's benefits are appealing, so maybe a higher score here, like 6?

2. Try to buy.
   - If it's affordable and seems effective, I might try it. Maybe around 5.

3. Consider buying.
   - Definitely considering, since the ad targets what I care about (energy). So perhaps a 7.

I think these scores reflect a mix of interest but also skepticism due to my personality traits like not being trusting and sometimes careless.
