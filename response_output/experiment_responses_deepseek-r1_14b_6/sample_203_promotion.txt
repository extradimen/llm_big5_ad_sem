Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman in my late twenties with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** Since I'm outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), ads that emphasize social aspects might appeal to me. However, the message is about staying energized and looking good, which could be relevant but maybe a bit too generic. I don't feel strongly positive or negative, so Neutral (4) seems right.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The promise of energy and appearance is tempting, especially for someone who's active. But without specifics, it feels vague. Maybe 3 on a scale where higher means more interest, but I'm not sure.

Wait, noâ€”since I agree with being helpful and unselfish (Agree), maybe the ad's focus on looking good resonates because of social interactions. So perhaps Neutral again? Hmm, maybe 4 for interesting too.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The claims are positive but lack evidence. As someone who does a thorough job (Strongly Agree) and tends to be careful (Disagree), I might question the ad's credibility. So probably Disagree (3).

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The combination of energy and appearance could appeal, especially considering my age where looking good is important. Maybe 5.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** While the idea sounds good, I'm not convinced without more info or a personal connection. Maybe Neutral (4).

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong belief in its effectiveness, trying it might be low on my list. Perhaps 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's something that could fit into my routine, so I might think about it. Maybe a higher score like 5 or 6? But since I'm not fully convinced yet, maybe 4.

Wait, considering I worry a lot (Neutral) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), maybe I'm cautious about new products. So purchase intentions might be lower.

Finalizing:

Ad attitude: [4, 4, 3, 5]
Purchase intention: [3, 4, 4]
