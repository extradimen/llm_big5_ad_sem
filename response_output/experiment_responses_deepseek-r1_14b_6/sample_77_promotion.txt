Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. They're a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree and a high income. She's outgoing, helpful, thorough, but sometimes careless and gets nervous easily.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. For someone her age, staying energized is important, especially if she has a busy office job. The part about looking good might appeal to her desire for social presentation since she's outgoing.

She strongly agrees with being helpful and unselfish, so maybe the ad's message of improving oneself could resonate. However, she tends to worry a lot and gets nervous easily, which might make her cautious about trying new products. Her thoroughness means she'd probably want more information before buying, but her carelessness might mean she doesn't research thoroughly.

The ad is positive and upbeat, aligning with her outgoing nature. But since she's not very trusting and sometimes finds ads manipulative, she might be skeptical of the claims without evidence. 

For attitude toward the ad: She might find it interesting because it addresses energy and appearance but not necessarily like it due to skepticism. It could be good if it's well-made, but she might not find it extremely attractive.

Purchase intention: She might intend to purchase if the product seems legitimate, but trying or considering it would depend on more information and overcoming her nervousness about new products.
