Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is pretty basic and doesn't seem to connect on a personal level. It's more about the negative consequences of not using the product, which might be off-putting. So, a 2 makes sense.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** There's nothing particularly engaging or creative here. It feels generic, so it gets a low score, maybe a 1.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The message is clear but lacks emotional appeal. Without any compelling visuals or storytelling, I don't see it as effective. A 2 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractiveness usually comes from creativity or emotional resonance. This ad doesn't hit those marks for me, so a 1 feels right.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** The ad doesn't provide any unique selling points or benefits that would make me want to buy it. So, I don't see myself intending to buy itâ€”score is 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Even if the message resonates a bit more on tiredness and looking dull, there's no incentive or reason to specifically choose this product over others. A 3 seems too high; maybe a 1?

Wait, that might be inconsistent. Let me rethink. The ad targets feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. If I'm someone who values looking good and being energetic, maybe it does have some appeal. So perhaps a 2 is better.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** While the message isn't very compelling, if I were in the market for such a drink, I might consider it as one option among many. A 3 feels more accurate here.
