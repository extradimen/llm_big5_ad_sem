Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my profile. I'm a male in my 20s from China, studying for a postgraduate degree while living with my parents. My monthly income is between 16 million to 25 million VND, which is on the higher side, so I have some disposable income. 

Personality-wise, I strongly disagree that I'm talkative or outgoing. I'm reserved but helpful and unselfish. I'm generally trusting but sometimes rude. I do thorough jobs, make plans, and follow through. I tend to be careless neutrally, get nervous easily as neutral, don't worry a lot, am emotionally stable, have an active imagination, and am original with new ideas, but I strongly agree that I have few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: it's targeting someone who wants to stay energized and look good daily. Since I'm a student, staying energized could be appealing, especially during exam periods or when I need to focus. The promise of looking my best adds another layer, maybe appealing to social aspects, though I'm not very outgoing.

I value being helpful and unselfish, which might make me consider products that benefit others, but this drink is for personal use. My thoroughness means I would look into whether the product actually works before purchasing. The ad seems a bit generic; it doesn't provide specific evidence or details, so as someone who tends to agree on being thorough, I might be skeptical.

I worry about the credibility of the ad. Since it's just a statement without proof, it feels manipulative. My tendency to sometimes be rude could make me critical of such marketing tactics. Also, my strong agreement on having an active imagination and originality makes me appreciate creative ads, but this one is too vague for my taste.

On purchase intention: I might not rush to buy it because the ad doesn't provide enough reason to trust the product's effectiveness. Plus, with a higher income, maybe I'd prefer more high-quality or proven brands rather than something advertised vaguely like this.

So, for attitude toward the ad: It's not particularly likable, interesting, good, or attractive to me. The message is too broad and lacks credibility, which aligns with my critical nature. For purchase intention, while I don't intend to buy immediately, I might consider it if more information becomes available, but on its own, it doesn't move me to action.
