Alright, let's break down how I would approach evaluating this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits.

First, understanding my background: I'm over 60, married, live in China, have a bachelorâ€™s degree, and earn between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. My personality leans towards being reserved but helpful and trusting. I worry a lot and tend to do thorough jobs. I don't make plans often and am not original.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

I need to assess how this message resonates with me. The key points are feeling tired and looking dull without the product. Since I'm over 60, maintaining energy levels and appearance might be concerns. However, the phrasing seems a bit negative, focusing on what happens without the drink.

Considering my personality: I'm reserved, which might make me less likely to be swayed by an ad that's too pushy or focused on social image. But I do worry a lot, so messages about feeling tired could resonate if it's portrayed as a genuine concern.

The ad seems to target looking and feeling good, which is important but perhaps not the primary focus for someone in my demographic who might prioritize health benefits over appearance.

Purchase intention: My thoroughness means I would likely research more before buying. The ad doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence, just a warning of negative effects without the product. This makes it less persuasive for me.

So, for attitude towards the ad, it's neutral because while it touches on concerns, the approach isn't very appealing to someone reserved and more focused on substance over image. For purchase intention, I'm not convinced enough to act immediately but might consider it after more information.
