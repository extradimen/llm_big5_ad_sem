Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** (Score: 4)  
   The ad is clear and directly targets the benefits of staying energized and looking good. It's straightforward but doesn't grab my attention much due to its generic nature.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** (Score: 3)  
   While it conveys a positive message, there's nothing particularly unique or engaging about it for me. It feels too common.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** (Score: 4)  
   The messaging is effective in conveying the product's benefits without being misleading. It's simple and to the point, which I appreciate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** (Score: 3)  
   Attractiveness depends on the visuals. If they're appealing, it might get a higher score, but with the given info, it's average.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** (Score: 2)  
   The ad highlights useful benefits, so I'm somewhat interested. However, without more specific details or a compelling reason, my intent isn't strong.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** (Score: 3)  
   There's enough incentive to consider trying it once. If available, I might give it a shot based on the claims.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** (Score: 4)  
   The benefits align with my needs for energy and appearance, making me more inclined to think about purchasing it.
