Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which appeals to someone who is outgoing and talkative, as indicated by my personality traits. However, I'm reserved, so maybe it's not a perfect fit. Plus, the ad feels a bit generic, which might not strongly resonate with me. So, a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The claims are clear but lack specific details about how the drink achieves these benefits. Without more information, it's hard to feel genuinely interested. A 3 seems appropriate here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Credibility is a bit lacking because there's no evidence or明星 endorsements mentioned. Plus, I'm somewhat doubtful of such health claims without more backing. So, a 4 feels right.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The imagery and messaging might be appealing to someone outgoing, but being reserved, it doesn't hit home as much. Also, the price isn't clear, which could deter me. A 3 on this one.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** While staying energized is a plus, I'm more cautious about health products and prefer evidence-based options. So, without trust in the ad's claims, my intent isn't strong here—4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** The idea of looking good is tempting, but I need more convincing before taking action. Maybe a 3, indicating some consideration but not a definite yes.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** There's enough about the benefits to make me think it could be useful, especially given my active personality. A 4 reflects that I'm on the fence and might look for more info before deciding.
