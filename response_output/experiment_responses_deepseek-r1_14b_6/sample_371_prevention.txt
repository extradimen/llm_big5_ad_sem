Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target demographic is a Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, married, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. He has specific personality traits: talkative (Agree), outgoing but Neutral, reserved (Agree), helpful (Agree), trusting (Agree), sometimes rude (Agree), thorough (Agree), makes plans and follows through (Agree), not careless (Strongly Disagree), not easily nervous (Disagree), neutral about worrying, emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), has an active imagination (Agree), original with new ideas (Strongly Agree), not so artistic (Disagree).

So, the person is reserved but helpful and thorough. He's emotionally stable and has an active imagination. He tends to be talkative but not overly outgoing.

The ad is focusing on preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. So, it's a preventative message. The target here might be someone who values their appearance and energy levels, which could be important for a civil servant, perhaps in maintaining professionalism.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - Considering he's reserved but helpful, maybe not overly excited about ads. But since it's about preventing tiredness, which is relatable, he might agree to liking it. Maybe a 4 or 5? Not super high because he's reserved.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Interesting could depend on how well it's presented. If the message is clear and makes him think, maybe a middle score like 3 or 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - For an ad to be good, it needs to be truthful and persuasive. Since he's trusting but also thorough in his approach, he might require more evidence. Maybe a 5? He believes it could be good but isn't fully convinced without proof.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on how well it resonates. Given his reserved nature, maybe not very attracted to it. A score like 3 or 4.

For purchase intentions:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's practical and thorough but might be cautious about new products. Maybe a low intent score, around 2 or 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it would require more than just an ad; perhaps he needs recommendations or evidence. A middle score like 4? Or maybe lower since he's not easily swayed.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is higher than intending, so if the ad makes him think about it, maybe a 5. He might add it to his list after thinking more.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: Maybe 4 (like), 3 (interesting), 4 (good), and 3 (attractive). But I need to adjust based on his traits. Since he's reserved, maybe lower than that.

Purchase intentions: Perhaps 2, 3, and 5. He considers it but isn't immediately intent on buying.

Wait, let me reconsider. The ad is about feeling tired and looking dull. For someone in a professional role like a civil servant, maintaining energy and appearance could be important. So maybe the ad resonates more than I thought. So perhaps higher scores for belief and attractiveness.

Alternatively, considering he's over 60, maybe traditional in his habits, so new products might not appeal as much. He's thorough, so he'd need to see evidence before believing the ad fully. Therefore:

Ad态度: Maybe 3 (like), 4 (interesting), 4 (good), 3 (attractive).

Purchase intention: 2 (intend), 4 (try), 5 (consider). Because while he might not intend to buy right away, he'll definitely consider it after thinking more.

I think I've gone through all the angles. Now I need to assign specific numbers.
