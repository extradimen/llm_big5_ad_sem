Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the given scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: Given my personality traits, I'm outgoing but sometimes rude. The ad's message about staying energized and looking good appeals to someone who values their appearance and energy levels. However, I don't have a strong interest in such products, so while it's not unappealing, I don't particularly like it. Hence, a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The ad's promise of daily benefits could be seen as positive, but since I tend to be careless and make thorough plans (but also sometimes neglectful), the message doesn't resonate deeply. It's somewhat interesting but not compelling enough for a higher score. So, 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The ad makes bold claims about energizing and improving appearance, which feels a bit too perfect. My tendency to be skeptical and sometimes rude makes me question the realism of these benefits. Thus, I don't fully trust it as a truthful advertisement, scoring it a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: While the idea of looking best every day is appealing, my reserved nature and focus on other aspects of life make the ad's message less captivating. It doesnâ€™t align perfectly with my priorities, so I give it a 4.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My high monthly income suggests I can afford such products, but my tendency towards being careless and not thoroughly planning purchases makes me less likely to commit. I don't feel strongly enough about the ad's message to plan a purchase, so a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Even though I might be interested in trying something new for energy, my generally trusting nature is balanced by being cautious with ads that make grand promises. It's on the fence, so a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: The ad does touch upon benefits that could be appealing, but considering other priorities and past experiences where similar products didn't deliver, I'm more in the 'consider' phase rather than committing. Hence, another 4.
