Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad is energetic and positive, which might appeal to someone outgoing, but my reserved nature makes me not particularly drawn to it. So a 4.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's clear about its benefits, but I'm more interested in unique ideas than this typical product claim. Maybe a 3.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is straightforward but lacks depth. It doesn't resonate with me much, so another 3.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Visuals might be appealing, but the content isn't compelling enough for me. A 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Not convinced by the claims; I'm more cautious and don't see a strong reason to buy. A 3.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Maybe if it's convenient or there's a deal, but no strong intent yet. Another 4.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on the radar, but I'm not sure. So a 5.

Overall, I'm neutral but slightly leaning towards not being convinced enough to buy.
