Alright, let me break down how I came up with the scores. Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. As someone who values being energetic and present, this resonates a bit. Plus, the promise of looking good is appealing. So, maybe a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but not particularly unique or engaging. It doesn't stand out much, so I'll go with a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the concept is positive, there's no specific proof or details about how the drink works. Without evidence, my belief in it is moderateâ€”so another 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The idea of looking best every day is nice, but without seeing visuals or more info, I'm not strongly attracted to it. A 5 feels right here.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: High price might be a barrier given my income. Plus, no strong reason to switch from current habits. So, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Maybe if it's available and affordable, but I'm not sure. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's on my radar, so definitely considering it. That's a solid 5.
