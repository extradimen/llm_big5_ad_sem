Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, I considered the ad's message: it suggests that without the drink, one might feel tired and look dull. Given my personality traits, particularly being talkative (Disagree) and outgoing (Disagree), but also having a Strongly Agree for thoroughness and originality, I can see how this ad targets someone looking to maintain energy and appearance.

However, my tendency to be careless (Strongly Agree) might make me less likely to pay attention to such ads. Also, since I'm a student with a postgraduate degree in China, perhaps I'm more focused on academic work than social appearances, making the ad less relevant. 

For attitude toward the advertisement, even though the idea is original (I scored 6), the ad's message doesn't strongly resonate with me because my priorities lie elsewhere. It feels somewhat manipulative but not entirely dislikeable.

Regarding purchase intention, while I'm somewhat open to trying new products, the ad doesn't create a strong enough desire for me to immediately consider buying it, especially since I don't feel tired or dull without it.
