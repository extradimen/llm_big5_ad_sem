Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad itself: The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My first thought is that it's targeting people who are looking to maintain their energy levels and appearance. Given my personality traits, I'm somewhat reserved but have an active imagination, so maybe the ad could resonate on a personal level.

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - I don't feel strongly about liking or disliking it, so I'll give a middle score of 4.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message is clear but not particularly engaging for me, so maybe a 3.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - It's straightforward and conveys its point effectively, so I agree somewhat with a 4.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Not really my style, so another middle score of 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Since I don't usually feel tired or dull without a drink, and considering my income is limited, maybe a 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - There's no strong motivation for me to try it, so another 2.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - I might think about it if someone else recommends it, but on my own, probably not, so a 3.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly connect with me due to my reserved nature and lack of perceived need, despite having an active imagination which could make the ad's message more relatable to others.
