Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese blue-collar worker in my late thirties. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Okay, so it's targeting people who want energy and good looks. As someone with a busy job, maybe this is appealing because I need to stay alert. But wait, am I into looking my best? Not really, since I don't prioritize that much.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm somewhat trusting (Agree), but also sometimes rude. I worry a lot and have strong disagreements with thoroughness and being outgoing. So, does the ad resonate?

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** Hmm, not sure. The message is positive, but it's too general. Maybe I don't feel a connection to it. So maybe around 3.
2. **Interesting.** It's not really interesting; it's just a standard claim. Maybe 2.
3. **Good.** Well, it's not bad, but also not great. Probably 4.
4. **Attractive.** Not particularly attractive to me, so maybe 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase:** No, I don't feel the need. So 1.
2. **Try to buy:** Maybe if it's recommended by someone, but not because of the ad. Still a 2.
3. **Consider buying:** If I saw it in a store or had a reason, maybe consider, so 4.

Wait, let me think again. Since I'm concerned about health and energy, but the ad doesn't offer specific benefits. Maybe for "consider" I should be lower? Or higher because of that?

No, considering my traits, I worry a lot but don't trust easily. The ad isn't compelling enough to make me try it.
