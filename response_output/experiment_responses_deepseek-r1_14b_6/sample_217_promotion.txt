Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree who is currently a student, living with her parents, and has a monthly income under 15 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative, helpful, trusting, thorough, careful, emotionally stable, original but not artistic.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll consider my attitude towards the ad. Do I like it? The message is about energy and looking good. As someone over 60, staying energized might be appealing, especially if studies or daily activities require it. However, the phrase "look your best" could target younger people more, so maybe not as relevant to me. On a scale of 1-7, I'd give this a 4. Neutral because while staying energized is good, looking my best might not resonate as much.

Is the ad interesting? Energy drinks are common, but if it's positioned for daily use, maybe. But being over 60, I'm more concerned about health benefits than looking good. So, perhaps 3. Disagree a bit on interest.

Is the ad good? It's straightforward and positive, which is good. The claims seem positive without being overly exaggerated. Maybe a 4 again—neutral because it's okay but not outstanding.

Is the ad attractive? Visuals and message matter. If the ad has appealing visuals with people looking energetic and vibrant, it might be吸引人。But since I'm more focused on health than appearance, maybe a 3. Not very attracted by the "look your best" part.

Now, purchase intention. Do I intend to buy? The drink's benefits are good, but I have limited income. Maybe not a priority. So, 2—disagree on intending to buy.

Will I try to buy it? Since it's available, maybe if someone recommends or if I see positive reviews. A 3—neutral.

Will I consider buying it? It depends on other factors like price and convenience. Without strong motivation, probably not. Another 3.

So overall, the ad doesn't strongly connect with me due to age-related preferences and income constraints.
