Okay, let me break this down. I need to evaluate how someone with my specific demographic and personality traits would react to the given advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, looking at my personality traits: I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), generally trusting (strongly agree), and have an active imagination but originality (strongly agree). However, I'm not talkative or outgoing. I make thorough jobs sometimes neutral, planning and follow-through strongly disagree, emotionally stable (strongly agree).

The ad's message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull without the drink. So it's targeting fatigue and appearance concerns.

Thinking about my own experience: As a civil servant in China, maybe dealing with long hours or stressful meetings where I need to stay alert. Looking presentable is important for work. If this drink helps me stay energized and look good, that could be appealing.

But wait, the ad doesn't specify how it works. It just says without it, you'll feel tired and look dull. That's vague. I'm a careful person (neutral on thorough job) but strongly disagree with making plans and following through. So maybe I need more information before trusting the product completely.

I tend to agree with being trusting, so if the ad is from a credible brand, that might help. But without specific details, it feels a bit manipulative. It's playing on fears of appearing unprofessional or tired, which could be effective for someone in my position.

On the other hand, I'm not very outgoing, but helpful and unselfish. The ad isn't directly targeting social interactions, so maybe that aspect doesn't resonate as much with me. However, looking good is important for work and personal presentation, so that might still influence me positively.

Emotionally, being stable (strongly agree) means I'm less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals. But the ad's message is more about functionality—helping with energy and appearance—so it's practical rather than emotional. That could align well with my personality since I don't get nervous easily and worry neutral.

Considering purchase intention: If the product seems effective, even without specific details, maybe I would consider buying it because it addresses real concerns. But I'm not sure if I'll rush to try it; I might wait for more reviews or information before actually trying it.

So putting it all together:
- Ad attitude scores: It's interesting (4), but I'm not strongly positive about liking it. Maybe 3, 4, 4, and 5?
Wait, no, let me think again. The ad is relevant to my needs as a working professional, so I might find it good. Interesting because it touches on important points, but maybe not the most attractive.

Purchase intention: I'm considering buying it (maybe 3), but not sure about trying or intending immediately.
