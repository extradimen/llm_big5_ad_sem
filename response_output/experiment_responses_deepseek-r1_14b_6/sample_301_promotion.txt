Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.** The tagline is generic and doesn't resonate with me personally. It feels too vague, so my score is a 2.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** There's nothing particularly engaging or unique about it. I give it a 3.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** While it's not bad, it doesn't provide compelling reasons to trust the product. A 4 seems fair.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals might be appealing, but the message isn't strong enough for me. I'll score this a 3.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** With my income level and no immediate need, there's no urgency. A 2 fits here.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Even if the ad doesn't strongly persuade me, I might consider it once out of curiosity. So a 3 makes sense.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** Given that the ad lacks specific benefits and I have other options, consideration is low. A 4 seems accurate but not too high.

Overall, the ad isn't impactful enough to drive significant interest or intention from me.
