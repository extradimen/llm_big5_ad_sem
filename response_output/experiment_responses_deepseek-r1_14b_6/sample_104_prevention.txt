Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree would respond to the ad. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, looking at his personality traits: he's outgoing but also reserved. That seems contradictory. But since both are agreed upon, maybe it means he's selectively social or perhaps values privacy. He's helpful and unselfish, so that makes him a considerate person. Trusting and stable emotionally, which probably means he doesn't get too worked up but is reliable.

He admitted to sometimes being rude, which might mean he's assertive in his communication. He's neutral on thoroughness and making plans, but strongly disagrees with following through. So maybe he's not the most organized person? Also, he's disagree with being careless, so he's careful but perhaps not overly detailed-oriented.

The ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since he's in his 30s-40s, maybe he's dealing with work stress, given his blue-collar job and higher income. He might be looking for ways to stay alert or energetic. The ad's message seems to tap into that need.

Looking at attitude towards the ad: 

1. I like the ad. – Does this ad speak to him? It addresses tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable. But does he connect with it on a deeper level? Maybe not strongly since he's more about being trusting and stable rather than someone who's easily swayed by ads.

2. Interesting. – The message is straightforward but not particularly engaging or creative. So maybe neutral on interesting.

3. Good. – If the ad is clear but perhaps a bit generic, his score might be moderate.

4. Attractive. – Since he has an active imagination and original ideas, maybe he's drawn to more creative ads. This one is quite basic, so perhaps it doesn't attract him much.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Maybe not immediately unless the ad really resonates or if he feels the product meets his needs. His score might be low.

2. Try to buy: Similar to above, but maybe a bit higher as trying once is less commitment.

3. Consider buying: He's more likely to think about it, especially if he identifies with the issues mentioned in the ad.

So putting scores on a 1-7 scale:

Ad attitude:
1. Like – Maybe 4/7? Not strongly liking but not hating.
2. Interesting – Probably around 3.
3. Good – Maybe 4.
4. Attractive – 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend – 3.
2. Try – 4.
3. Consider –5.

Wait, maybe I should adjust. Since he's helpful and unselfish, he might not be the type to prioritize himself over others, but if the drink helps him stay alert for work, it could matter. His emotional stability makes him less likely to be swayed by fear of tiredness, but perhaps more practical.

So maybe his ad态度 is lower on like (3), interesting (4), good (5), attractive (3). Purchase intention: intend (2), try (3), consider (6).

Wait, that might make sense. He's considering buying because it could be useful, but he doesn't feel a strong emotional connection to the ad.
