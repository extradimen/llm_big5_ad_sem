Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. So first, let me break down their background and personality.

They're a man in his 50s living in China, working as a blue-collar worker, making over 46 million VND a month. That's actually quite a high income for Vietnam, so maybe he's more affluent than average. He's living with parents, which might mean family is important to him.

Personality-wise, he's outgoing but also reserved. He strongly agrees that he's helpful and unselfish, which suggests he values social harmony. Heâ€™s neutral on being trusting, neutral on worrying, and tends to get nervous easily. He makes thorough plans, so maybe the ad needs to be clear and not too vague.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and appearance, which are pretty broad but could appeal to someone looking for daily boosts.

For attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. Since he's outgoing and helpful, maybe an ad that's positive would resonate. But the message is a bit generic. He might not feel strongly about it, so maybe around 4 or 5.
2. Interesting? The ad talks about staying energized and looking good. It's not too compelling but could be somewhat interesting. Maybe a 3-4.
3. Believes the ad is good. Since he's agreeable but the claims are broad, perhaps a neutral score like 4.
4. Attractive: The ad sounds appealing, especially for someone who values looking good and having energy. Maybe a higher score here, like 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: High price might be a barrier since he's affluent but still needs to consider costs. He makes thorough plans, so maybe not immediately, perhaps a lower score like 3.
2. Try to buy: Might be willing to give it a try, maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on his radar, so probably a higher score here, maybe a 5 or 6.

I think he's more about practicality and might not get excited by the ad but would consider it if it fits his needs.
