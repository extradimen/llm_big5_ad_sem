Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." As a civil servant in China who values being helpful and unselfish, I appreciate the ad's focus on collective well-being. The idea that not using the product could negatively impact both personal energy and social appearance resonates with my personality traits.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad.** (4) - The message is clear but a bit generic. It doesn't feel overly exciting, so a middle score.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** (3) - It's somewhat engaging because it addresses real concerns about tiredness and appearance, but not particularly novel.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** (4) - The message is positive and focuses on preventing negative outcomes, which aligns with my values of being helpful.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** (5) - It's visually appealing and the tagline is catchy, making it memorable.

Purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** (3) - While the message is appealing, I'm not convinced enough without more evidence or specific benefits.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** (4) - The ad makes me consider it, but I'd probably wait for more information or a recommendation.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** (5) - It's on my radar now; I might look into it further or see if others recommend it.

Overall, the ad does a good job of addressing concerns relevant to someone in my demographic and personality, but it doesn't push me towards immediate purchase without more information.
