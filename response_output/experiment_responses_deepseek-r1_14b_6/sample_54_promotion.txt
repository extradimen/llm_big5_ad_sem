Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intention. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: He's a single Chinese male in his late 30s with a bachelor's degree, earning between 16-25 million VND monthly. His occupation is listed as 'Other,' but given his income, he might be self-employed or have a specialized role. He's talkative? No, strongly disagree. Outgoing? Also no. Reserved? Again, no—so maybe he's somewhere in the middle? Or perhaps he didn't feel strongly about being reserved either.

Looking at personality traits: He's helpful and unselfish (Agree), very trusting (Strongly Agree), sometimes rude (Neutral), not thorough (Strongly Disagree), doesn't make plans well (Disagree), not careless (Strongly Disagree), not easily nervous (Disagree), emotionally stable? Neutral, has an active imagination (Strongly Agree), original with new ideas (Disagree), and artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. Since he's 30-39, maybe concerned about looking his best as he ages? But wait, he's single, so perhaps social image is important.

He values trust (Strongly Agree) and being helpful, but he doesn't see himself as talkative or outgoing. So the ad's message needs to be trustworthy without being too social-focused. He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas sometimes, which might make him interested in a product that claims uniqueness or provides a boost.

He is emotionally stable (Neutral), so maybe the ad doesn't need to play on strong emotions but should present facts. His income suggests he can afford premium products, but does this ad appeal to his price sensitivity?

Let's consider each attitude question:

1. I like the ad. He might not strongly like it because it's a generic message and doesn't cater specifically to his traits—maybe a 3.
2. Interesting? Maybe neutral since it's a common claim, so perhaps 4.
3. Believes the ad is good. Since he trusts (Strongly Agree), but the ad isn't making any extraordinary claims, maybe 4 or 5. Let's say 5.
4. Attractive: The message is positive but not particularly eye-catching for someone who's neutral on many traits—maybe a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? He's not impulsive (Disagree on making plans, not thorough). Maybe 2.
2. Try to buy? Possibly 3, because the claims are somewhat appealing.
3. Consider buying? Maybe higher than 'try' since he might think about it, so perhaps a 4.

Wait, but he has an active imagination and likes new ideas—maybe that drink could be seen as something new or innovative, which might make him more open to considering it. So maybe bump up the scores a bit.

Alternatively, he's not outgoing or talkative, so maybe the social aspect of looking his best isn't as important to him. So perhaps lower scores.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with him but isn't terrible either.
