Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive benefits. However, considering my reserved nature (Strongly Agree) and tendency to be careless (Agree), I might not find it particularly compelling or relevant enough to feel a strong liking towards it. So, I gave it a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The promise of energy and appearance benefits could appeal to many, but given my personality traits like being reserved and sometimes rude, I don't find it inherently interesting for me personally. A 4 seems fair here.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: While the message is positive, without specific details or emotional resonance due to my personality, I'm not strongly convinced it's a good ad for me. Hence, a 4.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual aspects might be appealing, but since I don't relate much to the energetic and appearance-focused message, the attractiveness is moderate at a 5.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: I'm cautious about products making broad claims without evidence. My tendency towards worrying a lot (Strongly Agree) makes me skeptical. So, a low score of 2.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: While the benefits are tempting, my general skepticism and being sometimes rude might make me less inclined to take action. A 3 here reflects that.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: There's some interest due to the positive claims, but without strong motivation or trust, consideration is low at a 4.

Overall, while the ad has elements that could appeal on surface level, my personal traits and skepticism towards such broad claims make me less likely to be swayed.
