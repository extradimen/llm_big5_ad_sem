Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. The key here is that it's using fear of looking tired or unattractive as a motivator.

Looking at the demographic profile: This person is over 60, married, earns a decent income in Vietnamese currency, and is currently a student. They have a high school education. So, they're probably someone who's active but might be more concerned about their health and appearance as they age.

Personality traits: He's talkative and outgoing but not reserved, which means he enjoys social interactions. However, being helpful and unselfish is neutral, so his tendency to help others isn't a strong point. He's very trusting and disagrees with being rude, making him a trustworthy person. He makes plans and follows through, which is positive for purchasing behavior.

He doesn't see himself as careless or nervous, so he's probably methodical in his decisions. His emotional stability is neutral, meaning he can handle stress but isn't overly affected by it. He lacks an active imagination and originality, and has few artistic interests, which might mean he prefers practical solutions over creative ones.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The message is about preventing tiredness and dull looks, which could appeal to someone who values social interactions and appearances. However, since he's older and perhaps more health-conscious, he might appreciate the benefits but not necessarily 'like' the ad in a positive way.

2. Interesting: The ad points out potential negatives without the product, which can be interesting. But given his age and possibly more traditional views, it might not strike him as very compelling or novel.

3. Good: From a functional standpoint, the ad highlights real concerns about tiredness and appearance. It's straightforward but lacks emotional depth or creativity, so he might find it just adequate rather than excellent.

4. Attractive: The visual aspect of the ad matters too. If it's well-made, it could be attractive, but without more details, it's hard to gauge. He's not very imaginative, so the appeal relies on practicality rather than aesthetics.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: He is methodical and follows through with plans, which bodes well for intent. However, he might be cautious about health products unless they're recommended by trusted sources.

2. Try to buy: His outgoing nature means he might seek out the product if it aligns with his needs, but without a strong emotional connection, he might not feel compelled to try it immediately.

3. Consider buying: Given that he makes plans and follows through, he's likely to think seriously about purchasing this drink if he finds value in its benefits.

Overall, while the ad touches on points he values (social presentation, health), his personality leans towards practicality over emotional appeal. The ad is clear but might not resonate deeply enough for him to feel a strong intent or desire to purchase without more convincing elements.
