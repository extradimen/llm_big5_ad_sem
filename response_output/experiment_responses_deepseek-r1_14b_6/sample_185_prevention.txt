Okay, let's break this down step by step. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant and living with my parents. My income is between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. 

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." First, I need to evaluate how this ad resonates with me based on the given personality traits.

Looking at my traits: I'm outgoing (strongly agree) but sometimes make plans and follow through? No, strongly disagree. So maybe not someone who's very methodical or planful. But I do find it important to look good and feel energetic, especially in a professional setting as a civil servant.

The ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull. As someone who values being presentable and perhaps influential in their work, this could be relevant. However, the phrasing feels a bit negativeâ€”emphasizing what you lose without the drink. I'm not sure if that's persuasive enough for me. It might make me consider it, but I don't feel strongly about it.

Considering my traits, I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), which makes me value products that enhance social interactions or well-being. The ad suggests the drink helps with energy and appearance, which could be appealing in a professional context where looking sharp is important.

Purchase intention: I might consider buying because of the potential benefits mentioned, but I don't have a strong desire to immediately purchase it. It's more about prevention rather than needing it right away.
