Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The advertisement is promoting a drink that helps stay energized and look good. Given my outgoing nature and active social life, the benefits of energy and appearance appeal to me. However, the ad feels a bit too generic and overused in its message, which makes it less likable than something more original or specific. So, I'd rate this a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - While the concept is good, there's nothing particularly innovative here. The claims are standard for energy drinks, so it doesn't catch my attention as unique or engaging. A middle-of-the-road score of 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The ad effectively conveys two key benefits: energy and appearance. These are relevant to many people, including me. However, without any emotional depth or compelling visuals, it doesn't fully resonate. A 5 reflects that it's decent but not outstanding.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visual appeal depends on execution, which isn't provided here. Assuming it's a typical ad with basic imagery and messaging, I might not find it particularly attractive. So, a 4 is appropriate.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - While the benefits are appealing, there's no strong reason over other products. The ad lacks specifics about what makes this drink different. Without unique selling points, my intent isn't high—maybe a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Given that I'm always on the lookout for effective energy and grooming solutions, I might give it a shot if there's some buzz or positive reviews. But without more info, it's a maybe—so another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The idea of looking good and staying energized aligns with my lifestyle, so I'd definitely think about it, even if I'm not immediately convinced. A solid 4 here.
