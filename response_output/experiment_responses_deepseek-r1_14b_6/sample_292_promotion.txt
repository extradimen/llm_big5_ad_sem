Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance, which tie into health and self-image.

Given my personality traits, I'm strongly agreeable with being helpful and trusting. However, I don't find myself to be talkative or outgoing. My reserved nature might make me less responsive to ads that emphasize socializing or outward appearances too much.

The ad's main selling points are staying energized and looking good. Since I value trust and being thorough (even though I strongly disagree with doing a thorough job, maybe implying I'm more efficient?), the product seems credible. But I'm not particularly focused on looking my best every day; more on functionality and trustworthiness.

For attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad: 3. It's okay, but doesn't excite me.
2. Interesting: 4. The concept is decent but not unique.
3. Good: 5. It meets basic needs but isn't outstanding.
4. Attractive: 3. The message is clear, but not visually or emotionally appealing.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 4. I might consider it if needed.
2. Try to buy: 4. Not a strong desire, but possible.
3. Consider buying: 5. It's on my radar for potential use.

Overall, the ad is somewhat appealing but doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my reserved and more practical nature.
