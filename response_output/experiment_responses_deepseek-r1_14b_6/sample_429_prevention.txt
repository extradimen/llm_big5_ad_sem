Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 60+ year old Chinese woman with a bachelor’s degree and a managerial job. My monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND. So, I'm quite comfortable financially.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but not super (agree), neutral on being reserved. Hmm, so maybe I'm more of an extrovert. Being helpful and unselfish is a disagree, which might mean I prefer to look out for myself sometimes. Trusting is strongly agree, so I trust people easily. Sometimes rude? Strongly agree, so I can come off as direct or maybe even a bit harsh in my communication. Thorough job – strongly agree, meaning I'm detail-oriented and careful. Making plans and following through – agree, so planning is part of my routine but not always the first thing on my mind. Careless – disagree, so I prefer to be organized. Nervous easily? Strongly disagree, so calm under pressure. Worry a lot? Disagree, meaning I don't stress too much. Emotionally stable – strongly disagree, so maybe I have ups and downs but try not to show it. Active imagination – strongly agree, creative thinker. Original and new ideas – agree, enjoy being innovative. Artistic interests – neutral.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. Given my age, I might be looking for ways to maintain energy levels. The ad is probably a prevention message, focusing on avoiding negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull).

Evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Like the ad: Well, it’s straightforward but maybe a bit too direct for me. Not sure if it resonates emotionally. Maybe 3.
2. Interesting: The idea of preventing tiredness and dull looks is interesting, so perhaps a 5.
3. Good: It serves its purpose clearly, so maybe a 4.
4. Attractive: I'm not sure the ad is visually appealing or creative enough for me, so probably a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The message makes sense, but I might be more inclined towards products with more proven benefits. So, perhaps a 5.
2. Try to buy: Without strong evidence, maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on my mind if it's presented well, so maybe a 6.

I think the ad is okay but could use more emotional appeal or specific benefits tailored to someone like me who values being thorough and original.
