Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**  
   The ad is pretty generic and doesn't speak directly to my situation. Since I'm a blue-collar worker focused on staying energized and looking good might not be top priorities, it's just average for me.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**  
   It does mention benefits that could relate to daily energy, which is somewhat relevant, so I find it somewhat interesting but not very compelling.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**  
   The message is clear, but without any specific details or emotional appeal, my belief in its effectiveness is moderate.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**  
   While not perfect, the visuals and tone are decent enough to catch my attention more than I initially thought.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (2/7)**  
   The ad doesn't provide enough reason for me to feel strongly about buying it. My current routine works fine without needing a new drink.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (3/7)**  
   There's a slight curiosity, but not enough to push me into trying it unless something changes.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (4/7)**  
   It's somewhat on my radar, so if I come across it again or there's more info, I might think about it.
