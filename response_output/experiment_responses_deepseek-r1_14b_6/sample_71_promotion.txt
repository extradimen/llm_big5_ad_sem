Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The advertisement is pretty generic and doesn't speak to my personal needs or lifestyle. It mentions staying energized and looking good, which are broad benefits. Since I'm reserved and value thoroughness, I don't feel a strong connection here. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message isn't particularly compelling for me. I'm not someone who's easily swayed by such general claims. It doesn't stand out as interesting because it lacks specifics. That would be a 3 again.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - While the ad makes some positive statements, I don't find them convincing enough. The claims are too vague and lack credibility for someone who values thoroughness and isn't easily trusting without evidence. So, I'd give it a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Visually, if the ad is well-produced with appealing visuals, maybe it's a 5. But since I'm more reserved and not very outgoing, I might not find it extremely attractive. 

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - No, because I don't feel any strong need for it. My scores are low here at 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without a compelling reason or trust in the product's effectiveness, trying it isn't something I'm inclined to do. So another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - While the idea is there, without more information or a personal connection, consideration is low. Maybe a 3.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate with me because of my reserved nature and the lack of specific benefits tailored to someone like me.
