Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My initial thought is that it's targeting people who are health-conscious or image-conscious. Given my background, as someone with a postgraduate degree and a managerial role, I might value products that enhance both physical energy and social presentation.

Looking at the ad's message: feeling tired and looking dull are negatives that people would want to avoid. The drink is positioned as a solution to these issues. Considering my personality traits, I'm talkative but not particularly outgoing or helpful, so maybe the idea of appearing energetic aligns with my desire to maintain a good image.

I scored the ad's attitude as 4, 5, 5, 6. Why? Because while the message is clear (good), it doesn't feel extremely interesting or attractive to me personally. The drink seems functional but not something I'd prioritize over other expenses.

For purchase intention, I gave lower scores: 3, 3, 4. My monthly income is quite high, so price might not be a barrier, but the ad's appeal isn't strong enough for me to rush out and buy it. There are probably better uses for my money, especially since I'm more focused on other aspects of life beyond appearances.

Overall, the ad misses the mark because while I understand its message, it doesn't resonate deeply with my personal values or lifestyle.
