Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad focuses on energy and looking good, which are relatable. Since I'm talkative and value being energized to engage socially, this resonates a bit. However, my reserved nature makes me less enthusiastic about products emphasizing social image heavily. So, a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but not particularly engaging. My neutral stance on creativity means I don't find it overly interesting. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the concept is solid, the execution might be too generic. Given my neutral feelings about ads in general, a middle score of 4 fits here.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals and message are standard for energy drinks, which I'm somewhat familiar with. But nothing stands out enough to make it very attractive to me. Hence, a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: I prefer practical products over those focused on image. Since the ad's benefits don't strongly align with my needs, my intent is low. A 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong motivation or a compelling reason from the ad, trying it isn't a priority. Another 2 here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While I'm not convinced yet, the idea of staying energized is somewhat appealing. This earns a 3 on consideration.
