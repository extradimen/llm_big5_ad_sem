Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my reaction to this advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My job is to evaluate this as if I were a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a high school education working as a civil servant, living with my parents, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Plus, considering my personality traits.

Looking at the ad itself, it's a prevention message. It's warning about the negative consequences of not using their product—feeling tired and looking dull. This seems to target someone who wants to maintain their energy and appearance. 

Now, considering my background: I'm a civil servant, so maybe I have a busy job that requires me to stay alert. Also, living with parents might mean social interactions are part of daily life, so looking good could be important.

Personality-wise, I'm somewhat talkative but not too much; outgoing is neutral, so maybe I don't have the strongest social circle. Reserved, helpful, and unselfish—so perhaps community-oriented. But I'm generally distrustful, which might make me skeptical of such ads. I sometimes feel rude, thorough in my work, but not great at following through plans. I get nervous easily, worry a lot, so stress is something I deal with. My imagination is active, but I don't come up with new ideas often and have strong artistic interests.

So, the ad's message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull. For someone who worries a lot and gets nervous, this could resonate because they might want to avoid looking unprofessional or tired, especially in their job as a civil servant where image might matter.

But I'm distrustful of ads, so I might question if this drink is really necessary or just another marketing ploy. Also, the message is quite direct but not very emotionally appealing to me since I don't find it extremely persuasive. It's clear, but doesn't create a strong emotional connection.

For purchase intention: The ad makes me think about the product because it addresses specific concerns. But my distrust and tendency to be careful with purchases might make me wait or seek more information before buying. However, the idea of not feeling tired is appealing for work and social reasons.

So, scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like - Neutral but not strongly positive. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting - The message is clear but not particularly engaging. Also a 3.
3. Good - It's a decent ad, maybe a 4.
4. Attractive - Not very attractive to me; perhaps a 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend - Not sure yet, so 3.
2. Try - Maybe, if convinced by more info, 3.
3. Consider - Yes, considering it, 4.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact scores yet. Let me think again.

If the ad is making me slightly interested but not very, maybe "like" is around 3. Interesting could be a 4 because the message is clear and relevant. Good might also be a 4 as it's functional. Attractive would be lower, say 2, since I don't find it visually or emotionally compelling.

For purchase, if the ad makes me think about trying it, maybe intend is 3, try is 3, consider is 4 because I'm somewhat interested but not fully convinced yet.
