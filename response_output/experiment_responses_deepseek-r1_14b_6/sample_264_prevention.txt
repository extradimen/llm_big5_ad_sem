Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, for the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad focuses on preventing tiredness and dull looks, which might appeal to someone looking to maintain their appearance. However, I'm not particularly interested in such products, so I gave a 3.
2. **Interesting.**: While the message is clear, it's pretty generic. It doesn't stand out or engage me much, so another 3.
3. **Good ad.**: The concept isn't bad, but without strong emotional appeal to me, it scores a 4.
4. **Attractive.**: The visuals might be nice, but I don't find them particularly compelling, hence a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.**: No immediate need or interest, so a 2.
2. **Try to buy.**: Not likely without more motivation, another 2.
3. **Consider buying.**: It's on my radar but not a priority, so I gave it a 3.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate enough with me personally, despite its clear messaging.
