Alright, I'm a 25-year-old woman from China with a bachelor's degree and working as a managerial employee. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, so I can afford premium products. Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing but not overly so. I'm helpful, trusting, thorough in my work, plan things well, and have an active imagination.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

The message seems to target people who want to stay alert and presentable. Since I value being thorough and making plans, avoiding tiredness is important to me. Plus, looking good matters in my professional role. The ad's straightforward but a bit generic.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Do I like it? It's functional, so maybe 4/7.
2. Interesting? Not really; it's too simple. So 3/7.
3. Good? It has a clear message but feels a bit clich√©. Maybe 4/7.
4. Attractive? Not particularly; no emotional hook. 4/7.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? If I believe it works, maybe 5/7.
2. Try it? Possibly, as I like trying new things. So 6/7.
3. Consider buying? Maybe, but I need more info or a strong reason. 5/7.

Overall, the ad is okay but lacks something to make me feel strongly about it.
