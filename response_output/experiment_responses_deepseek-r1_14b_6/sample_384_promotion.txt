Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **Like the ad (score 5):** The ad is positive and makes me feel it's a good product, but some parts are too generic.
2. **Interesting (score 4):** It mentions staying energized and looking good, which I can relate to, but not groundbreaking.
3. **Good (score 5):** The message is clear and appealing, but it doesn't stand out much.
4. **Attractive (score 6):** The ad's visuals likely appeal to me as a busy professional needing energy.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy (score 3):** I'm interested, but there are many similar products.
2. **Try to buy (score 4):** If it's convenient and priced well, I might try it once.
3. **Consider buying (score 5):** It's on my radar, but I'll wait for more info or offers.

Overall, the ad resonates a bit but lacks what would push me to act immediately.
