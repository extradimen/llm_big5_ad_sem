Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: it suggests that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. Given my personality traits, I'm someone who is outgoing and sociable (Agree), so looking good and feeling energetic probably matters to me in social settings. However, I also tend to be careless (Strongly Agree) and sometimes make plans but don't always follow through (Neutral). 

The ad's message plays on the fear of appearing tired or dull, which could impact my social life. Since I value being sociable, this might resonate with me. The idea that the drink can help maintain energy levels and appearance is appealing in that context.

Looking at the attitude scores:
1. I like the ad: 4. While I appreciate the message, it's a bit generic. I'm not strongly moved by it, but there's some interest.
2. Interesting: 5. The concept of preventing tiredness and dull looks is interesting enough to make me pause.
3. Good: 4. It's good in that it addresses social concerns, but it doesn't feel groundbreaking or particularly creative.
4. Attractive: 5. The ad's message is attractive because it targets a real concern for someone like me who values their appearance and energy.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: 3. I'm not immediately convinced to buy; more thought is needed.
2. Try to buy: 4. There's enough appeal that I might consider giving it a try, especially if others recommend it or if I see it frequently.
3. Consider buying: 5. The ad makes me think about the product as something useful, so considering it is likely.

Overall, while the ad isn't perfect, it touches on points that matter to my social side but doesn't strongly push me towards purchase yet.
