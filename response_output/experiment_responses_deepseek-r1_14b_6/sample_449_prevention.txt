Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores for the advertisement and purchase intentions. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude towards me as a 50-59-year-old male from China with a postgraduate degree, currently a student and divorced. My income is around 26â€“35 million VND per month. Considering my personality traits: I'm outgoing but sometimes careless and tend to get nervous easily.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This targets feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product. Given that I'm a student, maybe juggling studies and other responsibilities could lead to fatigue. The idea of looking dull might resonate if I care about my appearance.

For ad_type: It's a prevention-focused ad because it's highlighting negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull) to prevent those from happening by using the product.

Now, scoring the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.**: 3 - Neutral. The message is straightforward but might not be very engaging or original for me.
2. **Interesting**: 4 - Slightly agree. It touches on common concerns, so it's somewhat interesting.
3. **Good**: 5 - Agree. It effectively communicates a clear benefit without being over the top.
4. **Attractive**: 6 - Slightly strongly agree. The message is simple and direct, which I might find attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: 2 - Disagree. While the ad makes me aware of the issue, it doesn't create a strong enough desire for immediate action.
2. **Try to buy**: 4 - Slightly agree. There's some consideration because it addresses a real need, but not a compelling one.
3. **Consider buying**: 5 - Agree. I might think about it if I'm in the market for such products, but no urgent need.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly persuade me to buy immediately but keeps me considering it as an option.
