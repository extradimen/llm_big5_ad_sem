Alright, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. 

First, I need to understand what the ad is saying. It claims that the drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day. So, it's targeting people who want energy and good appearance.

Looking at my background: I'm from China, male, 20-29 years old, high school education, not employed in a specific job, divorced, and my monthly income is less than 15 million VND. My personality traits are a mix of outgoing but also somewhat reserved. I don't consider myself helpful or unselfish, which might make me more self-focused. I'm trusting but sometimes get nervous and worry a lot, so maybe anxiety is a factor. I tend to be thorough in my work, plan things well, but not very imaginative or original.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, the message seems positiveâ€”staying energized and looking good are appealing. But considering my reserved nature and being self-focused, maybe it's too upbeat for me. Also, I'm not sure if it connects with my personality. So maybe a 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea of looking your best every day is catchy, but without seeing creative execution, it might not hold much interest. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? It makes health and appearance claims, which can be persuasive, but since I'm more reserved and careful, I'd want to see evidence. So perhaps a 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? The visuals would matter. If it's appealing with vibrant colors or relatable scenarios, maybe 6. But if it's too flashy, I might not find it attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: High price might be an issue since my income is limited. Plus, I'm doubtful about the product's effectiveness without proof. So a 4.

2. Will try to buy: If the ad makes me curious, I might look for it in stores or online, but again, cost and trust are factors. Maybe a 5.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar now because of the ad's claims, so probably a 6 if I'm considering trying it once, but not sure yet.

Overall, the scores would reflect that while the ad has some appeal, my cautious nature and financial constraints make me less likely to purchase immediately.
