Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 60+ year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (agree), outgoing (neutral), reserved (agree), helpful (agree), trusting (agree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough (agree), planful (agree), not careless (strongly disagree), not easily nervous (disagree), neutral about worrying, emotionally stable (strongly agree), imaginative (agree), original and creative (strongly agree), and have some artistic interests (disagree).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I need to assess my attitude towards the ad. Let's go through each part.

1. Do I like the ad? Well, since I'm reserved and helpful but also somewhat talkative, maybe the message is positive. It sounds like it could be good for health, which might appeal to me as someone who values staying energized, especially in a demanding job. But being reserved, I might not feel strongly about it. So maybe a 4.

2. Is the ad interesting? The claim of looking your best every day is appealing, but I'm more practical. Maybe 3.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's trying to sell health benefits, which makes sense. But without specific details, it feels a bit vague. Maybe 4.

4. Is the ad attractive? The idea of looking your best is positive, but without seeing the actual product or more info, maybe a 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm cautious with purchases and prefer practicality over trends. Without knowing the price or benefits, probably not. So 2.

2. Will try to buy: Since it's about energy, which is important, but not sure if it's effective. Maybe a 3.

3. Consider buying: It could be useful, but I'd want more information first. Maybe a 4.
