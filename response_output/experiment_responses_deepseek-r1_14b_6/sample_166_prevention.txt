Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. The user is a single male in his 30s with a postgraduate degree and a high income, working as a blue-collar worker. His personality traits include being talkative, outgoing, reserved, helpful, not trusting, sometimes rude (but he strongly disagrees), not thorough, plans and follows through, careful, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, not emotionally stable, not imaginative, but original and has few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This is a prevention-oriented message, highlighting the negative consequences of not using the product. It appeals to someone who might be concerned about their energy levels and social image.

For ad attitude:
1. Like - The ad's message is relatable if he's worried about appearing tired, but his personality leans towards being reserved and maybe not overly concerned with social image. So a 3.
2. Interesting - The ad targets feelings of tiredness and dullness, which might resonate given his tendency to worry and get nervous. A 4.
3. Good - It's a clear message, but the emotional appeal might not strongly connect. Maybe a 3.
4. Attractive - Not particularly attractive as it's more about avoiding negatives rather than positive imagery. So another 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend - The ad makes a specific claim, but without evidence or strong personal relevance, he's not likely to intend buying immediately. A 3.
2. Try - He might consider trying it if others recommend, but the ad alone isn't persuasive enough. Another 3.
3. Consider - He might think about it, especially if tiredness is a recurring issue for him, so maybe a 4.

Overall, his scores reflect moderate interest and consideration without strong intent to purchase based on this ad.
