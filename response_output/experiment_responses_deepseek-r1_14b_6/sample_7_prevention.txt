Alright, let me go through this step by step. So, I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese student living with my parents and earning about 36 to 45 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so I can afford things, but since I'm a student, maybe I don't spend all of it.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, okay. The message is about avoiding tiredness and looking good. I guess it's targeting people who want to stay energized and presentable.

My personality traits: Neutral on talkative and outgoing, so not very into social activities but also not reserved. Strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean I'm more focused on myself. Agree on trusting, sometimes rude, thorough job, careless, gets nervous easily, worried little, emotionally unstable, not imaginative, original at neutral, and few artistic interests.

So, for the ad: The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's trying to appeal to my desire to look good and feel energetic, which makes sense for a student who might have busy schedules or social life.

First attitude questions:
1. Like the ad? Well, it's direct but maybe a bit over the top. Not sure if I like it, so maybe neutral around 3.
2. Interesting? It has a catchy message, but not very unique. Maybe 3.
3. Good? The message is clear but doesn't feel very inspiring. Maybe a 3.
4. Attractive? The wording is straightforward but not visually appealing as an ad. So, probably a 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? I'm cautious about ads that make strong claims without evidence. Not sure, maybe 2.
2. Try to buy? If it's available and seems effective, I might consider it once. Maybe 4.
3. Consider buying? It's an option if others recommend or if the product gets good reviews. Maybe a 5.

I think my scores would reflect that the ad isn't strongly appealing but has some consideration points.
