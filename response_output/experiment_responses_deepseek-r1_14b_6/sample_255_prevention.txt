Alright, I'm going to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a Chinese civil servant with the given demographic and personality traits. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target people who are looking for an energy boost and want to maintain a good appearance. 

Starting with my attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, the message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Given that I have a busy job as a civil servant, staying alert is important. However, the wording feels a bit negative. It focuses on what you don't want (feeling tired and looking dull) rather than the positive aspects of the drink. Since I tend to be reserved (strongly disagree), maybe I'm not very drawn to this kind of message that emphasizes social appearance too much. So, I would give it a 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? The idea is to prevent tiredness, which can be relatable, especially for someone in my position. But it doesn't really grab my attention as something unique or exciting. It's more of an everyday concern. On a scale of 1-7, I'd say 3.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear, but it's quite generic and not very compelling. There's no emotional appeal or innovation in the concept. Plus, I'm not very trusting (disagree), so I might question how effective this drink really is without more evidence. So, a 3 here as well.

4. Is the ad attractive? The visual aspect isn't described, but if it were just text-based, it's not very engaging. It doesn't evoke strong emotions or create a desire to try the product. Therefore, I'd rate this a 3.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to purchase this product? While staying alert is important, there are many energy drinks available. The ad doesn't provide enough reason for me to choose this one over others. Plus, my tendency to be thorough (strongly agree) means I'd want more information before deciding. So, 2.

2. Will I try to buy this product? If the ad were part of a campaign with more persuasive elements or offers, maybe. But as it stands, without strong motivation, I'm not inclined to make an effort to purchase. A 3 seems fair here, as neutral but slightly leaning towards trying if other factors push me.

3. Will I consider buying this product? There's some consideration because the issue is relevant, but it's low on my priority list. So, a 4, meaning I'm somewhat open to considering it under certain circumstances.
