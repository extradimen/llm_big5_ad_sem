Alright, let's figure out how this person would respond to the ad. She's a Chinese civil servant in her late 30s with a high income and strong personality traits like being reserved, helpful, trusting, and emotionally stable but also careless and gets nervous easily.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. So, for someone in her position, staying energized could be appealing, especially since she's a civil servant who might need to maintain energy throughout work hours. Looking good is another plus, which many professionals care about.

But considering her personality, she's reserved, so she might not be the most outgoing person. However, she's helpful and unselfish, so perhaps she would appreciate that the drink could help her look her best to support others or herself in a professional setting. She is strongly trusting, but also sometimes careless. The ad doesn't provide specific evidence, which might make her feel it's too vague—so maybe she's neutral about believing it.

She tends to worry a lot and gets nervous easily, so the idea of something that helps stay energized without side effects could be reassuring. But the ad is short on details, which could be a downside. She makes plans and follows through, but she also tends to be careless, so perhaps she's not the most detail-oriented in her purchases.

Looking at her income level, she can afford premium products, so price might not be an issue. The drink's benefits align with her desire for stability and looking good, which are important to her.

Now, evaluating the ad: She finds it somewhat interesting because it targets energy and appearance, but maybe not deeply engaging since it's a general claim without specifics. She's emotionally stable but gets nervous, so she might be more cautious about the claims. She has an active imagination but isn't original, so the ad's message doesn't particularly stand out to her creatively.

For purchase intention: She intends to buy? Maybe not strongly because she's careful and wants evidence. But she will consider it if she feels it aligns with her needs—maybe 5/7. Trying it might be a middle ground since she's cautious but open to new products.
