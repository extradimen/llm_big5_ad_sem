Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm evaluating an advertisement for a drink that's supposed to help you stay energized and look your best every day. My task is to score my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, I need to consider my background: I'm from China, male, 20-29 years old, have a bachelor's degree, work as a blue-collar worker, am divorced, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits are that I'm reserved, helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in my work, neutral about making plans, not very careless, get nervous easily, worry a lot, have an active imagination, original with ideas, and have neutral artistic interests.

So, starting with the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key selling points here are energy and appearance. Given that I'm in my 20s, staying energized might be relevant, especially if I have a busy job or personal life. Looking good is also something many people care about, so that's another plus.

Looking at my personality traits, I'm reserved but helpful and trusting. However, the ad seems a bit too general. It doesn't specify how it helps with energy or appearanceâ€”does it contain certain ingredients? How does it make you look better? Without specific details, it might feel like empty claims to me, especially since I tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily, which makes me more skeptical.

I'm also sometimes rude, but that's probably not directly related here. My tendency to be thorough might make me question the ad's lack of specifics. On the other hand, my active imagination and originality could make me open to creative ideas, but if the ad is too vague, it might not resonate as well.

Regarding purchase intention: I earn a decent income for someone in their 20s in China, so maybe I can afford such products. But without clear benefits or evidence, I'm hesitant. The ad's attractiveness depends on how compellingly it presents the benefits, but since it's vague, I'm not convinced to try it.

Also, considering my age and occupation, I might be more health-conscious, which this drink could tap into, but again, without specifics, it's hard to feel confident about the product.

So, putting it all together, my attitude towards the ad would probably be neutral leaning towards slightly disagree. The purchase intention is similarly low because I'm not convinced enough by the claims.
