Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score how much I like the ad (on four aspects) and my intention to buy the product (on three aspects), each on a scale from 1 to 7.

Let me start by understanding my demographic profile. I'm male, under 20, living in China, have a postgraduate degree, work as a managerial employee, are divorced, and earn between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income. My personality traits include being outgoing (Agree), sometimes rude (Agree), original with ideas (Strongly Agree), but not helpful or trusting (both Strongly Disagree). I have an active imagination, so that's a point.

Now, looking at the ad: it targets energy and looking good. Given my high income, maybe I'm more interested in premium products. But the ad is quite genericâ€”no specifics on how it helps with energy or appearance.

I like the ad? Hmm, not sure. The message is positive but vague. Since I'm outgoing, maybe the idea of looking good appeals to me socially. But as someone who's original and values new ideas, the ad lacks specific innovation. It might feel too generic.

Is the ad interesting? Not really. There's nothing unique or surprising here. It just states two benefits without any engaging details or creativity. So probably a low score on interesting.

Is the ad good? Well, it's not bad, but it's also not excellent. It fulfills basic advertising purposes but doesn't stand out. Maybe around 3 or 4.

Attractive? The visuals might matter, but since I don't have info on that, I'll assume it's average. Maybe a 4.

Purchase intention: Do I intend to buy this product? Well, the ad mentions staying energized and looking good, which are appealing, especially for someone in a managerial role who might need energy. But without specific evidence or unique selling points, I'm not strongly convinced. So maybe neutral on intending but more towards considering it.

Will I try to buy it? Maybe if it's convenient or well-branded, but nothing makes me rush to buy it immediately. So perhaps a 4 for trying.

Will I consider buying it? Given the benefits and my income level, yes, I might think about it. So a higher score here.

So putting it all together, ad attitude scores: [3, 2, 3, 4]. Purchase intention: [4, 4, 5].

I should make sure these scores reflect my personality traits. Being original and having an active imagination means I look for unique ads, which this isn't. So lower scores on like and interesting. On the other hand, considering buying it is higher because the benefits align with my lifestyle needs.

Wait, maybe I'm being too harsh. Let me think again: If someone with high income and outgoing might appreciate a product that enhances their appearance and energy, but since the ad doesn't provide specifics, it's hard to connect deeply. So low 'like' score makes sense. Interesting is also low because nothing stands out.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The ad is positive, so at least somewhat good, hence 3 for good. Attractive might be a bit higher if the visuals are appealing, but without knowing, perhaps 4.

Purchase intention: Intend to buy isn't high because I don't feel compelled. Try is neutral, and consider is more likely because it's something that could fit into my life.
