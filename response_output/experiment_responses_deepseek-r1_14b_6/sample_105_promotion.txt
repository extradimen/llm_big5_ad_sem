Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** Given that I'm reserved and not very outgoing, energetic ads might not resonate as much. Plus, being talkative isn't my trait, so an energizing drink might feel irrelevant to me. So, a 2 here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The promise of looking good is appealing, but the overall message feels generic and not tailored to someone like me who prefers more introverted activities. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat interesting, but not really engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** I don't trust ads much, especially since I'm generally distrustful. The claims seem too vague and lack personal relevance. A strong disagree here, so 1.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** As someone who gets nervous easily and isn't into social scenes, the energetic vibe doesn't attract me. So, another 1.

Moving on to purchase intention:

5. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm not really convinced by the benefits offered. It doesn't address my needs as a reserved individual, so a 2.

6. **I will try to buy this product.** Without any strong motivation or trust in the ad, trying it isn't something I'd consider. A 3 because there's a tiny bit of curiosity but mostly hesitation.

7. **I will consider buying this product.** Even though it's somewhat considered, my cautious nature and lack of belief in the ad mean it's a low score. Maybe a 4, but on second thought, it's still not high enough, so I'll go with 3.
