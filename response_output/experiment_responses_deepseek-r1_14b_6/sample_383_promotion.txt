Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the demographic profile is a Chinese male in his 50s-59, with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant, living with parents, and earning between 16k to 25k VND monthly. His personality traits show he's talkative and outgoing but not reserved. He strongly agrees that he's helpful and unselfish but is disagreeing on being trusting. He sometimes feels rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, isn't good at making plans, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, doesn't worry much, is emotionally stable, has an active imagination but isn't original, and doesn't have strong artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

I need to evaluate his attitude towards the ad and his purchase intention based on these traits. 

Starting with the ad态度:

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Considering his personality, he's talkative and outgoing, which might make him more responsive to ads that emphasize social benefits. The ad highlights energy and looking best, which could appeal to someone who values their appearance and social interactions. However, he's also somewhat careless and tends to be rude sometimes, so maybe the ad isn't speaking directly to his deeper needs.

He's helpful and unselfish but is not very trusting of others or ads? Since he's disagreeing on being generally trusting, that might make him more skeptical of the claims in the ad. So, the ad's effectiveness could be lower for him because he doesn't fully trust it.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

He tends to be careless and sometimes rude, which might indicate impulsiveness, but his lack of thoroughness could mean he's not the most reliable in following through. He doesn't make plans well either, so maybe he's less likely to intend to purchase immediately. However, being helpful and unselfish might make him more open to products that offer benefits beyond just himself, especially health-related ones.

But since he worries little but is emotionally stable, perhaps the ad's message about staying energized and looking good doesn't hit a strong emotional chord for him. He might not feel an urgent need for such a product unless it aligns with his specific needs or interests.

Putting this together, I think his态度 towards the ad would be somewhat neutral to slightly positive but not strongly so. For purchase intention, he might consider buying but isn't highly motivated.
