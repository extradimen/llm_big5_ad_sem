Alright, let me try to figure out how this user is feeling about the ad and their purchase intention. So, first, I need to understand the background and personality of this virtual person.

They're a Chinese woman in her 40s, an office worker with a high school education, divorced, earning around 36-45 million VND per month. That's a decent income, so she might be looking for quality products.

Looking at her personality traits: she's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. She sometimes feels rude and is careless. Not trusting and doesn't make thorough plans. So, maybe she values straightforwardness and efficiency in ads.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Itâ€™s targeting energy and appearance. Since she's talkative, perhaps she values social interactions and looking good to maintain her image. But being not so outgoing, maybe the ad's message is a bit too pushy for her.

She tends to be careless and sometimes rude, which might make her less trusting of ads that emphasize drastic changes. The ad's claim about tiredness and dullness could resonate if she feels those effects daily, but without trust in the product, she might not feel compelled to buy it.

Her income suggests she can afford such products, but her personality traits don't indicate a strong need for social validation beyond what's necessary. So, while she might acknowledge the ad is good and interesting, she doesn't strongly like it or find it attractive enough to purchase.

For purchase intention, she has neutral feelings about trying, intending, or considering buying. She might not feel urgent need but could think about it if she faces tiredness often.

Overall, the ad touches on points that are relevant but her personality and feelings towards ads make her not strongly consider purchasing.
