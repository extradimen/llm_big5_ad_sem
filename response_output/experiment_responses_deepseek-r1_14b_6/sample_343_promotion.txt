Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like (3):** The ad mentions staying energized and looking best daily, which seems appealing but maybe a bit too generic for me given my reserved nature.
2. **Interesting (4):** It touches on two key points—energy and appearance—which are important, so I find it somewhat interesting.
3. **Good (5):** While the message is positive, it feels a bit overused in ads, but still effective enough to score higher than average.
4. **Attractive (4):** The visuals might be attractive, but without specific details or emotional resonance, it doesn't quite captivate me.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend (3):** I'm cautious about products unless there's a strong reason, and this ad lacks specifics on benefits.
2. **Try (4):** There's some interest in the idea of energy boosters, so maybe I'd consider trying it once.
3. **Consider (5):** The concept is appealing enough that I might think about buying it, especially if others recommend it.

Overall, the ad isn't compelling enough to drive an immediate purchase but has elements that make me give it some consideration.
