Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as someone with a specific demographic and personality profile. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting people who might be concerned about looking their best and feeling energetic. 

Given my background: I'm over 60, living in China, female, postgraduate education, not working, live with parents, income under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved, talkative, helpful, thorough, good at planning, get nervous easily, worry a lot, not emotionally stable, not imaginative, and have few artistic interests.

So, considering the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink, it might appeal to someone who values their appearance and energy levels. However, as someone over 60, I might be more focused on health than looking "dull," but the wording is a bit vague.

Attitude towards the ad:

1. Like: The message is somewhat relevant, but I'm not sure if it's strong enough to make me like it. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's trying to create a problem-solution scenario, which can be interesting. I'll go with 4.
3. Good: It's okay but doesn't really stand out. Maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: The visuals and message need to be appealing. Without knowing the visuals, it's hard, but maybe a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: I might not feel compelled to buy based on this ad alone. Perhaps a 2.
2. Try: If the ad makes me think about it, I might consider trying once, so 3.
3. Consider: It does make me think, but not enough for immediate action, maybe a 4.

I'm scoring lower because the ad doesn't strongly resonate with my personality and concerns. Being reserved and careful, I need more convincing before acting.
