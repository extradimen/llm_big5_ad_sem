Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality.

The person is from China, male, over 60 years old, has a high school education, works as a blue-collar worker, is married, and earns less than 15 million VND per month. That's about $700 USD or so? Probably living in an urban area since they're connected enough to see ads, but maybe not the highest income bracket.

Personality-wise, he's reserved (agrees), helpful and unselfish (strongly agrees), but generally distrustful (strongly disagrees). He sometimes makes plans but can be careless, gets nervous easily, and worries little. He is emotionally stable, which might make him more reliable in his decisions. However, he has few artistic interests and isn't original or imaginative.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. Now, considering his personality traits:

He is reserved but helpful, so maybe the social aspect of looking good could appeal to him if he interacts with others. But since he's reserved, perhaps less emphasis on social image? He's trusting or not—since he strongly disagrees with being generally trusting, he might be skeptical of the ad's claims.

The drink promises energy and better appearance. For someone over 60, staying energized could be a selling point if they feel tired. But given his monthly income is low, maybe price is a concern. The ad doesn't mention cost, which could be an issue for him.

He tends to be careless but makes thorough plans sometimes. His emotional stability might mean he's less swayed by emotional appeals but more logical. However, the ad is positive and aspirational—looking good and energetic can appeal to anyone wanting to feel better.

But considering his distrust, he might question if the drink actually works. The lack of details about ingredients or benefits could make him skeptical. He might also not be interested in products that require ongoing purchase without clear necessity.

His agree score on worrying little suggests he's less likely to get stressed about not buying the product, so maybe lower intent to purchase.

He is original? No, but the ad is general and doesn't stand out. His lack of artistic interest might make the ad less appealing to him aesthetically.

So, for attitude towards the ad: He might not like it much because it's not tailored to his personality (reserved, not imaginative), and he's distrustful. So scores for like, interesting, good, attractive would probably be low.

Purchase intention: He might not intend to buy because of cost concerns, skepticism about the product's effectiveness, and maybe not seeing a strong need given his age and possibly different priorities. So lower intent to try or consider buying.

Wait, but he is helpful and unselfish—maybe if the drink helps others, he'd be more inclined? But the ad doesn't frame it that way. It's about personal benefits: staying energized and looking good.

Hmm, perhaps not a strong enough appeal for him. So overall, low scores on both attitude and purchase intention.
