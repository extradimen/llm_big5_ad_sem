Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, considering the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink, I can see it's targeting a need for energy and social appeal.

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad seems to focus on avoiding tiredness and appearing dull, which are relatable concerns. However, as a civil servant in China, maybe a more professional image is valued over social appearances. Still, the message isn't too off-putting, so I give it a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept is straightforward but not particularly engaging or unique. It doesn't stand out enough to capture my interest beyond its basic premise, so a 3 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the message is clear, I don't find it particularly compelling or memorable. There's nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't leave a strong impression, hence a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The ad doesn't really appeal to me visually or emotionally since it lacks creativity and depth. I'm not drawn to it, so a 2 is appropriate.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Given that the ad targets social appearance and energy, which aren't top priorities for me right now, my intention isn't strong. Plus, there are many similar products available, making this one not compelling enough. A 3 reflects that.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without a strong personal need or compelling reason, I'm not motivated to seek it out specifically. So, a 3 is reasonable.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While the ad doesn't push me towards immediate consideration, I might think about it if someone else recommends it or if I see it again in a different context. A 4 captures that slight consideration without much enthusiasm.
