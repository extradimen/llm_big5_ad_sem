Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese blue-collar worker would respond to the advertisement. Let me start by understanding his background and personality.

He's a male in his 30s-39, living with parents, earns around 16-25 million VND per month. That's about $700 to $1,100 USD, which is decent but not high income. His education is a bachelor's degree, and he works as a blue-collar worker, so maybe in manufacturing or construction.

Personality-wise, he's outgoing (Agree), which means he likes social interactions. He's reserved? Neutral there. He tends to be helpful and unselfish: Disagree, so maybe not very considerate of others' needs. Trusting? Strongly Disagree, so he doesn't trust easily. He sometimes rude? Strongly Disagree, so maybe he's polite but could be guarded.

He does thorough jobs: Neutral, so neither good nor bad at being meticulous. Makes plans and follows through: Agree, so he's goal-oriented. Careless? Agree, which might mean he's not too attentive to details. Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree, so anxiety is a factor for him. Worry a lot? Strongly Disagree, but maybe that contradicts; perhaps he doesn't show it or handles stress differently.

Emotionally stable: Neutral. He has an active imagination and original ideas, so creative but maybe not always practical. Artistic interests: Neutral, so maybe no strong affinity for arts but could appreciate creativity in other areas.

Now, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance.

Looking at his traits:

1. Outgoing – might value products that enhance social life.
2. Not trusting of ads – he's a Strongly Disagree on trusting, so he might be skeptical of the ad's claims.
3. Agrees to being sometimes careless – perhaps not too concerned about health details but could be persuaded by convenience.
4. Makes plans and follows through – so maybe values products that aid in productivity or sticking to routines.
5. Gets nervous easily – an energy drink might appeal if he uses it to manage stress, but his skeptical nature might make him question the effectiveness.

His personality suggests he's a bit guarded towards ads but has social tendencies. The ad emphasizes energy and looking good, which could align with someone who wants to maintain a certain image, especially since he's outgoing. However, his distrust in ads might make him pause before believing the claims.

Purchase intention: He might be interested if it fits into his routine for energy or socializing but would likely want more evidence or personal recommendations before buying.
