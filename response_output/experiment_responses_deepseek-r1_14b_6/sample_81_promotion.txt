Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad.** - The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are appealing points. However, the phrasing feels a bit generic and not tailored to my background as a blue-collar worker. Plus, the claims are vague without specifics on how it works. So, I'm somewhat neutral but more towards disagree because of the lack of personal relevance.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The idea of energy and looking good is intriguing, especially since people often seek these benefits. But again, the ad doesn't connect with my daily life as a worker or address any specific needs I might have. So, neutral leaning towards disagree.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - While the message is positive, it's too broad and lacks convincing evidence or details. Without trust in the brand or clear benefits, I don't see much value here. Hence, a low score.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visual aspects might be appealing, but without personal relevance, it doesn't hold my attention. So, neutral again with a slight disagreement.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - No strong reason to buy based on the ad alone. I don't feel compelled after seeing it once.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Maybe if reminded elsewhere or offered a discount, but not enough incentive from the ad itself.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on my radar, but without more info or trust in the brand, I'm not seriously considering it.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate with me because of its generic approach and lack of personal relevance.
