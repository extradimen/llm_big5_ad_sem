Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement from a virtual person's perspective. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down how I would approach this.

First, understanding the demographic: She's from China, female, in her 20s-30s, has a postgraduate degree, works in an office, is divorced, earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are mostly disagreeing with being talkative or outgoing, reserved, helpful, trusting, etc., but she gets nervous easily, is emotionally stable, and has an active imagination.

So, the ad targets tiredness and looking dull without the drink. It's likely aimed at people who feel exhausted or want to look more vibrant. Given her job as an office worker, she might be feeling tired from work, which could make this relevant.

But evaluating the ad: Does it appeal to her? She finds ads that are good and attractive if they resonate with her needs. The message seems to suggest a problem (feeling tired and looking dull) and offers a solution through the drink.

Her personality traits: She's not talkative or outgoing, so maybe she's more introverted but still in an office job which can be draining. Emotionally stable but gets nervous easily—so perhaps she's looking for ways to manage stress or maintain her appearance under pressure.

The ad is trying to create a need by highlighting negative outcomes of not using the product. It’s a common persuasive tactic, but does it work here? The phrasing seems a bit direct, maybe too much so for someone who prefers more subtle approaches.

Considering her personality, she might be more analytical and less swayed by emotional appeals unless they directly address her concerns. The ad is straightforward about the benefits, which could be seen as practical, aligning with her postgraduate education and perhaps logical thinking.

Purchase intention: She might consider it if the product seems effective. But given that she's in a job where looking good might matter, maybe this drink is part of self-care. However, the ad doesn't provide evidence or specific benefits, so it's just a claim.

She’s emotionally stable but sometimes gets nervous, so products that promise to alleviate stress could be appealing, but the ad doesn’t speak deeply enough to her emotional state.

Also, she has an active imagination and is neutral on originality. The ad isn't particularly creative; it's more of a functional message, which might not capture her interest as much as something more imaginative or tailored.

So overall, she might not strongly like the ad because it doesn’t align with her personality traits of being reserved and perhaps not very outgoing. It’s too direct and may not resonate emotionally enough for her to feel compelled to purchase, even if she's considering it.

Therefore, in terms of ad attitude scores: Not particularly high, maybe 3-4 on each since it's somewhat relevant but not compelling. For purchase intention, she might be a bit hesitant but could consider it, so scores around 3 or 4 for each.
