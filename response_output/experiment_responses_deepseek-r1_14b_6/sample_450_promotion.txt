Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic and personality traits. The person is from China, male, aged 30-39, has a high school education, is a student, married, with a monthly income of 26 to 35 million VND. His personality traits show he's talkative and outgoing, which means he likely enjoys social interactions and might be influenced by products that enhance his social life or appearance.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and looking good. Since he's in his 30s, married, and possibly active socially, the idea of staying energized could appeal to him if he has a busy lifestyle. Also, looking good is something many in this age group might care about for social or professional reasons.

Now evaluating each ad attitude question:

1. I like the ad. Since he's outgoing, an ad that promises to help him look his best and stay energized could be appealing. He might find it positive and relatable. So a 5 seems reasonable.
2. Interesting: The ad is concise but the promise of energy and appearance improvement might not be groundbreaking, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: Considering the points it makes are positive, but maybe not deeply compelling to him yet, perhaps a 5.
4. Attractive: Given his outgoing nature, an attractive design or message could catch his eye, so likely a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The ad targets his needs, but he might need more information or personal experience before intending to buy, so maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: He's open to new products, especially if they align with his values of being helpful and outgoing, so perhaps a 4.
3. Consider buying: It's something he might think about after seeing the ad, so maybe a 5.

I need to make sure these scores reflect his personality accurately. His tendency to worry a lot and sometimes be rude suggests he might have some skepticism towards advertisements, which could lower his intent slightly. Also, being original and imaginative means he might look for more unique selling points, but this ad is straightforward.
