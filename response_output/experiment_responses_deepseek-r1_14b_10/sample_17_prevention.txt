Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My job is to assess how someone like me would perceive this ad and whether they'd be inclined to buy the product.

Let's start by understanding my background: I'm a male from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant, divorced, and earning between 36 million to 45 million VND per month. That's a decent income for Vietnam, so I have some purchasing power.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative but not outgoing. Reserved, helpful, and unselfish, which are positive traits. However, I'm generally distrustful, which might make me cautious about ads. I'm thorough in my work, plan things well, and don't tend to be careless. But I get nervous easily and have strong emotional stability.

Now, looking at the ad: it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull without the drink. It's likely a product aimed at boosting energy or improving appearance, maybe an energy drink or a supplement.

I need to evaluate my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention on a 7-point scale.

For the ad态度:
1. I like the ad.
2. Interesting.
3. Good.
4. Attractive.

Considering I'm reserved and sometimes distrustful, I might not immediately connect with an ad that makes strong claims without evidence. The message is direct but perhaps too simplistic. It's trying to create fear of missing out on energy or looking tired. However, since I worry a lot (but I strongly disagree on worrying), maybe this aspect doesn't resonate much. Also, being talkative and thorough, I might appreciate an ad that's clear, but the message feels a bit too direct without any emotional appeal.

As for purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy.
2. Try to buy.
3. Consider buying.

I'm someone who plans and follows through, so if the product seems reliable, I might be inclined to consider it. But given my distrustful nature, I'd need more evidence or a strong reason to trust the product. The ad doesn't provide any information about the product's benefits beyond not feeling tired or looking dull. It lacks credibility for me because it's too vague.

So, in terms of attitude towards the ad, maybe 3-4 on each since it's somewhat clear but not very engaging. For purchase intention, perhaps lower scores as I'm cautious and need more information before deciding.
