Okay, let me try to work through this. I'm a 50-59 year old man from China with a bachelor's degree and working as a managerial employee. I live with my parents and earn less than 15 million VND per month.

First, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

I'm talkative and outgoing, so maybe ads that emphasize social aspects might appeal to me. But this ad is more about personal benefitsâ€”staying energized and looking good. Since I find myself getting nervous easily (strongly agree) and worry a lot (agree), maybe the idea of staying energized could be a positive thing. However, my other traits like being reserved (disagree), unselfish (disagree), trusting (strongly disagree), thorough job (strongly disagree), making plans (strongly disagree), careless (disagree), emotionally stable (disagree), originality (disagree), and artistic interests (strongly disagree) might make me less responsive to the ad.

The ad's message is about personal energy and appearance, which could be important for someone in their 50s. But given that I'm more reserved and not as trusting, the ad's claims might seem too good to be true. Also, since I don't have a strong imagination or originality, the ad's message might not resonate deeply with me.

For purchase intention: My income is less than 15 million VND, which in Vietnam isn't very high. If this drink is expensive, it might not fit my budget. Plus, given that I'm not someone who follows through on plans (strongly disagree), maybe I'm less likely to take action even if the ad appeals.

So, for attitude toward the ad: Maybe 3-4 on each since it's somewhat relevant but doesn't strongly connect with me. For purchase intention, perhaps lower scores because of budget constraints and skepticism towards the product's claims.
