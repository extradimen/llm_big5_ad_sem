Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad as a student in my late 30s from China, with an income around 25 million VND monthly, the ad's message is about staying energized and looking good daily. That seems relevant because students often have busy schedules and might need energy boosts.

However, considering my personality traits: I'm talkative but not outgoing or reserved. This makes me somewhat neutral towards the social aspect of the product. The ad doesn't strongly appeal to my need for social interaction since I don't prioritize being around others much.

The ad claims to help look your best, which is a positive point, but without specific details on how it works, I'm not fully convinced. This affects how interesting and good I find the ad. 

When thinking about purchase intention: I do plan things through (strong agree), so I would consider if this drink fits my needs. However, being cautious (strongly disagree with trusting easily) makes me want more information before buying.

I tend to be thorough in my job (strongly disagree) but when it comes to health products, I need evidence or recommendations to trust the product fully. Hence, while I might consider trying it, there's not enough reason yet to intend purchasing or actually try to buy it.
