Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their background: they're from China, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree but are a blue-collar worker. They live with parents and earn around 36-45 million VND per month. So, that's a decent income, which might mean they can afford such products.

Personality traits: They disagree being talkative and outgoing, so maybe not very social. But they agree on being helpful, reserved, and thorough. Disagree with trusting people and sometimes being rude. Strongly agree on doing thorough jobs but disagree on making plans, which is a bit contradictory? They get nervous easily, worry a lot, but are emotionally stableâ€”maybe they're cautious. Don't have an active imagination or original ideas, so perhaps more practical.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance.

For the ad attitude:
1. I like the ad. Maybe not, since she's reserved and might not be into such ads.
2. Interesting? Not sure; maybe neutral.
3. Good? Probably not, unless it resonates with her needs.
4. Attractive? She's not outgoing, so maybe not.

Purchase intention:
She's thorough but doesn't make plans, so maybe she's cautious about buying new products. But if the ad makes her think the drink is useful for energy and looking good, which are daily concerns, especially at her age. So she might consider it, but not strongly intend to buy immediately.
