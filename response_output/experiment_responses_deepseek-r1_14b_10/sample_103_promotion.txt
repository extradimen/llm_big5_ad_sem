Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My goal is to score each of the attitude and purchase intention questions on a 7-point scale based on my given profile.

Starting with my demographics: I'm from China, female, under 20, have a bachelor's degree, not employed in any specific listed job, single, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a decent income for someone under 20 in Vietnam, but wait—actually, the user mentioned Vietnamese currency? Wait no, maybe it's a typo because China is involved. Hmm, but I think the key point here is that I have a high income relative to my age.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Agree), not so helpful or unselfish (Disagree), Neutral on trusting people, sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), thorough in my work (Agree), make plans and follow through (Strongly Agree), not careless (Disagree), get nervous easily (Agree), don't worry a lot (Disagree), emotionally stable (Agree), not very imaginative (Disagree), original with ideas (Agree), have few artistic interests (Neutral).

So, I'm outgoing, talkative, planful, and sometimes rude. I tend to be thorough but also get nervous easily.

Now, looking at the ad: It targets energy and appearance. Since I'm under 20, maybe this drink is aimed at young people who want to stay energetic and look good daily. That makes sense because students or young professionals might need that.

Let me think about each part of the evaluation.

1. Do I like the ad? Well, if it's an ad targeting energy and appearance, and considering my outgoing nature, maybe it's appealing. But does it feel genuine? I sometimes worry about the credibility of such ads because they often make exaggerated claims. On a scale of 1-7, I might give it a 5. Not strongly liking or disliking, but neutral.

2. Is it interesting? The message is clear: energy and looking good. That's something many people care about, especially if they're active. But the ad doesn't provide much detail—like how exactly does it help with looking good? Maybe a 5 here as well since it's somewhat interesting but not extremely so.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? Hmm. For me, believing an ad depends on trust and evidence. The message is positive but lacks specifics. Since I'm neutral about trusting people, maybe I'm more skeptical. So, perhaps a 4—leaning towards disagreeing that it's a good ad because of lack of details.

4. Is the ad attractive? Visuals matter here. If the ad has appealing visuals with energetic people, it could be attractive. But if it's just text, then maybe not. I'm giving it a 5 again because without knowing the visuals, it's hard to say, but the message itself is neutral in attraction for me.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I make thorough plans and follow through, which means once I decide on something, I stick with it. But since I'm sometimes rude and not too helpful, maybe I don't feel compelled by this ad alone. So a 5—leaning towards neutral because the ad doesn't provide enough reason for me to intend buying.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe if I see it somewhere else or have more info, I might consider trying it once. So a 4 here—disagree but not strongly.

3. Consider buying: If the product is presented well and aligns with my needs (staying energized), then perhaps I would consider it. A 5 seems fair because it's possible but not certain without more information.
