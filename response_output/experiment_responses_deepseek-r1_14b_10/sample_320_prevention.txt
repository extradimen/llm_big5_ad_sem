Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. They're a male in his 30s from China, living with parents, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. He's a manager but has a high school education. His personality traits show he's outgoing and helpful but not talkative, trusting is something he strongly disagrees with, sometimes rude—disagree, does thorough job—strongly disagree, makes plans—he doesn't follow through, careless—strongly disagrees, gets nervous easily—strongly agrees, worries a lot—doesn't agree, emotionally stable—no, has an active imagination and original ideas.

So the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key points are about feeling tired and looking dull. Given his personality, he's outgoing but maybe not too talkative. He gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot. He's creative but probably prefers something that aligns with his active imagination.

The ad seems to target someone who wants to stay energetic and look good. It's more of a prevention message—avoiding the negative consequences of not using the product.

Now, evaluating his attitude towards the ad: he might like it if it makes him feel better socially, but since he doesn't worry much, maybe it's not as impactful. Interesting? Maybe, because it's about looking good and energy. Good? Not sure, depends on how relevant it is to him. Attractive—probably yes, since prevention ads can be sleek.

For purchase intention: He might intend to buy if the product aligns with his need for social appearance, but considering he doesn't make thorough plans or follow through, maybe lower intent. Trying, considering—maybe on the higher side because of the appeal.
