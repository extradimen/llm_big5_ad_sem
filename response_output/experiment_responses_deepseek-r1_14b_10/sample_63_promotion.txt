Okay, I'm a Chinese man in my late thirties with a bachelor's degree and working as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which is about $1,700 to $2,180 USD. That's a decent income for someone in China, but it's not extremely high.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm neutral on being talkative and outgoing, which means I might be somewhere in the middle—maybe more reserved than talkative. I disagree with being reserved, so perhaps I find myself somewhat social but not overly so. My helpfulness is strongly disagreed upon, meaning I don't consider myself very helpful or unselfish. Trusting others isn't my strong suit either—I'm a bit of a skeptic.

I sometimes agree that I'm rude to others, which might make me seem less approachable. Being thorough and careful isn't one of my strengths; I tend to be careless at times. However, I do make plans and follow through with them, so maybe I'm reliable in some areas. Emotional stability is a strong point for me—I don't get nervous easily or worry much. That's reassuring.

I have an active imagination and original ideas, which suggests I might be creative. But I strongly disagree with having few artistic interests, implying that I do have an appreciation for art.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance—two things that are important to many people, especially those in their thirties facing work and personal life challenges.

Given my income level, I might be looking for something that offers value but is within my spending habits. My personality traits could make me more critical of such ads. Since I don't find myself particularly trusting or helpful, I might not connect with the ad on an emotional level. The ad's message seems positive and aspirational, which could resonate with some, but given my tendency towards being somewhat reserved and less trusting, it might not hit home.

I'm also more practical, as indicated by my disagreeing with thoroughness but agreeing to make plans. So I might look for concrete benefits rather than emotional appeals. The ad focuses on energy and looking good, which are tangible outcomes.

On the other hand, since I have an active imagination and original ideas, perhaps the ad's message is appealing enough in a conceptual sense, even if my personality makes me more skeptical about its claims.

Considering all this, I might not be very swayed by the ad. It's interesting but perhaps too generic, lacking specific evidence or personal relevance to me. My skepticism towards trust and being unhelpful might make me question the ad's credibility. However, the active imagination could mean that the creative aspect of the ad is somewhat engaging.

So, for attitude scores:
1. I like the ad: Neutral (4), since it's neither strongly liked nor disliked.
2. Interesting: Maybe 5, because the message is not groundbreaking but has some appeal.
3. Good: Probably a 5 as well; it's decent but not outstanding.
4. Attractive: Around 6, maybe, if the visuals and message are appealing.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: 2—unlikely at first glance.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 3, considering the ad's message might make me curious.
3. Consider buying: Perhaps a 4, as I might think about it but not immediately act on it.

But wait, given my income is decent, maybe I'm more open to trying new products that offer visible benefits. Energy drinks are common, so unless this one has unique selling points, it's hard to stand out. The ad doesn't provide specific details, which makes me less inclined to trust it fully.

So perhaps the attitude scores are lower than I thought. If the ad is not very engaging or lacks specifics, maybe I don't find it too interesting or good. So:

1. Like: 3 (Meh)
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 5
4. Attractive: 5

Purchase intention might be even lower because without trust or specific benefits, the likelihood to buy decreases.

Intend: 3
Try: 3
Consider: 4
