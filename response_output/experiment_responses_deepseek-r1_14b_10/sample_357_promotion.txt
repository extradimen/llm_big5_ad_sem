Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to an ad for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best every day. Let's break it down based on their demographic profile and personality traits.

First, the person is from China, male, between 20-29 years old, with a high school education, works in 'other' occupation, is divorced, and has a monthly income under 15 million VND. Their personality traits include being reserved, helpful and unselfish, generally trusting, but sometimes careless and tends to be nervous easily. They are emotionally unstable, not very imaginative, and not original or artistic.

Now, the ad claims that this drink will help you stay energized and look your best every day. So, I need to think about whether this person would find this ad appealing and if they would consider buying it based on their personality.

Starting with attitude towards the advertisement:

1. I like the ad: The person is reserved, so maybe he's not someone who seeks out social interactions or products that promise a social boost. Since he finds others sometimes rude but generally helpful, perhaps an ad that emphasizes looking good and having energy might appeal to him if it makes him feel more confident in his reserved manner. But since he tends to be careless and not very imaginative, maybe the ad's message is too generic for him.

2. I think the ad is interesting: The ad combines two benefits â€“ energy and appearance. However, the person has a neutral stance on trusting ads but sometimes worries a lot. He might be skeptical about products that make grand promises, especially if he's not very imaginative or original. So maybe he doesn't find it particularly interesting.

3. I believe the ad is good: Trust is important here. The person strongly agrees with being generally trusting, which could make him more open to believing the ad. But at the same time, since he tends to be careless and perhaps not too thorough, he might not critically assess the claims in the ad, making it believable.

4. I find the ad attractive: Since he's reserved, maybe he doesn't find ads that are overly energetic or outgoing attractive. The ad is about looking your best, which could appeal to him if he values personal appearance, but given his personality, perhaps not enough to find it very attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product: He might be interested because staying energized can relate to feeling better in daily life. However, considering he's on a lower income and has a high school education, maybe he's more cost-conscious. If the product is expensive, his intent would be low.

2. I will try to buy this product: The ad might pique some curiosity, but without a strong emotional connection or trust in the brand, he might not actively seek it out. His tendency towards being careless might mean he doesn't prioritize trying new products unless there's a clear benefit.

3. I will consider buying this product: He might give it some thought if he feels the benefits align with his needs, like needing more energy for work or daily activities. However, without strong motivation or trust in the brand, consideration might be low.

So, putting it all together, I think the ad's effectiveness would be moderate for him because while he trusts ads and the promises are appealing, his reserved nature and tendency towards carelessness might make him indifferent towards taking action.
