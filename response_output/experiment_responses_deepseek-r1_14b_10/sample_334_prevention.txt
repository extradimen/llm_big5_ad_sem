Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:
1. **Like the ad (score 3):** The ad is straightforward but feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate strongly because my personality leans towards being reserved and careful, so the message isn't compelling enough.
2. **Interesting (score 4):** It has a clear message that's easy to understand, which makes it somewhat interesting, though not engaging on a deeper level.
3. **Good (score 3):** While the message is clear, it lacks depth and creativity, so I don't find it particularly good or inspiring.
4. **Attractive (score 5):** The simplicity of the message might appeal to me on some level, but it doesn't create a strong visual or emotional impact.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (score 2):** I'm not convinced enough by the ad to feel an immediate need or desire to buy the product.
2. **Try to buy (score 3):** There's a slight curiosity, but without a stronger emotional connection or compelling reason, it doesn't push me to try it.
3. **Consider buying (score 4):** The message is clear enough that I might think about it in the future, especially if there are other factors like convenience or availability.

Overall, the ad's impact on me as a consumer is limited due to its generic approach and lack of depth, despite my personality traits that include being reserved and sometimes careless. These factors contribute to a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the ad but don't translate into a strong intention to purchase.
