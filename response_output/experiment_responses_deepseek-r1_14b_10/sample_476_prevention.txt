Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an ad for a drink that's supposed to help you not feel tired and look dull. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the person is a 40-49-year-old Chinese male civil servant with a bachelor's degree, single, earns around 26-35 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income in Vietnam, so he might be looking for quality products that fit his lifestyle. His personality traits show he's talkative but not outgoing or reserved. Heâ€™s helpful and unselfish but generally not trusting. He sometimes worries, is careless, not very thorough, and has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." I need to evaluate how much he likes the ad and his intention to buy the product based on this message.

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Does he like the ad? The ad suggests that without the drink, one might feel tired and look dull. Given his age, he might be concerned about energy levels and appearances, especially in a professional setting as a civil servant. However, being single and with a high income, maybe the ad appeals to him by highlighting the need for stamina and looking good. But considering he's somewhat untrusting and not very outgoing, maybe he doesn't immediately trust the claim. So I'd rate this around 5.

2. Is the ad interesting? The message is straightforward but might not be particularly engaging because it's a common health drink claim. He's more into being talkative than outgoing, so maybe not too interested in something that's just another energy drink. Maybe a 4 here.

3. Does he believe the ad is good? Since he's cautious (disagree on trusting others), he might be skeptical of such claims. The message is simple but lacks evidence or specifics, which makes it less credible to him. So perhaps a 4.

4. Is the ad attractive? He doesn't have strong artistic interests and is somewhat reserved. The ad's message might not be visually appealing enough for him if it's just text, so maybe a low score like 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's concerned about looking good and being energetic, but he's also careless. Since the ad doesn't provide strong evidence or benefits beyond what's typical, he might not feel compelled to buy immediately. Maybe a 4.

2. Try to buy: He's single, maybe with disposable income, so if the ad makes him think it could help, he might consider trying it once. But since he tends to be careless and worries little, perhaps a 5 here as neutral.

3. Consider buying: Given his high income, he might be willing to spend on quality products but needs more convincing. Without more information, he might not actively consider it, so maybe a 4.

Putting it all together, I'd score the ad's attitude as [5,4,4,3] and purchase intentions as [4,5,4]. But wait, in the previous example, the scores were lower. Maybe because the person is more critical of such ads, especially since he tends to be careless but still values being helpful. Hmm, perhaps I should adjust.

Wait, maybe for ad attitude, since the message could resonate with his concerns about energy and appearance, but he's not very trusting or outgoing, so 5 seems right. The other scores might need adjustment. For purchase intention, considering his income and needs, he might be more inclined to try it, hence higher scores.

Wait, perhaps I overcomplicated it. Let me think again:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: 5
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 4
4. Attractive: 4

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 5
2. Try: 5
3. Consider: 6

No, that might be too high. Alternatively, he's more likely to consider it than intend immediately.

Final thought:

Ad attitude: [5,4,5,4]

Purchase intention: [4,5,5]
