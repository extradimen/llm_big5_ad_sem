Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my response to this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to think about the ad itself. It's a preventive message, right? It's telling people that without this drink, they might feel tired and appear dull. So, it's positioning the product as something that can prevent those negative outcomes. 

Now, considering my background: I'm from China, in my 20s, have a high school education, am a managerial employee with a decent income, and I'm divorced. My personality traits include being helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, thorough, careless, nervous, worried, but emotionally stable, not very talkative, not outgoing, reserved, not particularly original or artistic.

Let's start with the ad's attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** Hmm, does this message resonate with me? It suggests that without the drink, I might feel tired and look bad. As a managerial employee, looking professional is important, so appearing dull could be a concern. But I'm not sure if the message is strong enough to make me like it. Maybe neutral. So 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** Interesting? Preventive ads can sometimes be seen as a bit negative or fearmongering. Since I'm worried a lot and get nervous easily, maybe this makes me anxious. But I'm not sure if that's interesting. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Good? I think it's trying to make people aware of potential issues without the drink, but does it provide any evidence or specific benefits? It feels a bit vague, so maybe a low belief score. Maybe 3 again.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractive? The message is about looking good and feeling good, which are positive outcomes. But the ad is phrased negativelyâ€”what you might lose without it. That could be less appealing than a positive, solution-focused ad. So maybe a 4.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Intend? The ad makes me aware of possible problems but doesn't give specific benefits or evidence. I'm not convinced enough yet. Maybe 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Try? If it's a new product and the message is somewhat convincing, maybe I might consider trying it once. But I'm still on the fence, so perhaps a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Consider? Yes, the ad makes me think about it. It's positioning itself as something that could help with energy and appearance. So, definitely a consideration point. Maybe a 5.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: [4, 3, 3, 4]

Purchase intention scores: [3, 4, 5]
