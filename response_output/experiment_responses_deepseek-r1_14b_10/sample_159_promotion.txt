Alright, let's figure out how to approach this evaluation. I'm a female office worker in China, under 20, with a high school education. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which I think is about $675 USD. That's not a lot, so I might be more price-sensitive.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm outgoing and helpful, but not talkative. I make thorough plans, but sometimes I can be careless. I worry a lot, get nervous easily, and have an active imagination with original ideas. However, I don't have much interest in the arts.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So it's targeting energy and appearance.

First, attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like it? Hmm, maybe not. The target benefits are good, but without knowing how the product works or seeing the evidence, I'm not sure if it's trustworthy. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The idea of looking best every day is appealing, so probably a 4.
3. Good as an ad: It's positive and makes you feel good, but maybe a bit generic. A 3.
4. Attractive: I'm not sure if the visuals or message are strong enough. Maybe another 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Without trust in the product, I might not intend to buy it. So a 2.
2. Try to buy: If someone recommends it, maybe I'd consider trying it once. A 4.
3. Consider buying: I'm on the fence; maybe if the price is right or there's an offer. A 5.

I think my score might be lower because of limited income and not being convinced by the ad alone.
