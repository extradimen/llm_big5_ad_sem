Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's positioning itself as something that prevents tiredness and keeps you looking good.

I'm a bachelor's degree holder working in an office, so my job might be somewhat stressful but not overly demanding physically. However, since I'm under 20, maybe I'm still in the phase where socializing is important, given my outgoing personality. 

The ad seems to target people who care about their appearance and energy levels. Being talkative and outgoing, I do value looking good and feeling energetic when I'm out with friends or colleagues. The idea that without this drink, I might feel tired and look dull could resonate because I want to maintain a good image.

But wait, the ad is somewhat fear-based—making me think of negative outcomes if I don't use it. I get nervous easily (Agree) and sometimes worry a lot (Disagree), so maybe that aspect makes me a bit uncomfortable. It feels a little manipulative because it's playing on my fears of looking bad or feeling tired.

I'm also someone who is generally trusting (Strongly Agree), which might make me more open to the ad's claims. However, I tend to be careless (Disagree) and worry a lot (Disagree), so maybe I'm not as concerned about these issues as the ad suggests.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: It's interesting because it addresses social concerns, but I'm neutral on whether it's good because I find the approach a bit pushy. The attraction factor is moderate—maybe a 4 or 5 because while it's relevant to my interests, it doesn't particularly stand out in a unique way.

For purchase intention: I don't have an immediate need for such a drink, and there are probably many similar products. So my intent is low. Trying it might be something I consider if others recommend it, but considering buying it is on the lower end as well.
