Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how I would respond to this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me think about my background. I'm a blue-collar worker in China, married, with a high income. My personality traits include being reserved, thorough, making plans, getting nervous easily, having an active imagination, and originality but also having few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad itself: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message is about preventing tiredness and looking bad without the product. It's a prevention-focused ad because it's highlighting what might go wrong if you don't use their product.

Now, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: Hmm, do I connect with this? Since I'm reserved, maybe not too drawn to an ad that's trying to make me feel something strongly. But prevention is a good angle for someone who values thoroughness and planning. So on the scale of 1-7, where 1 is strong disagree and 7 is strong agree. Maybe a 4 because it's somewhat relevant but doesn't excite me.

2. I think the ad is interesting: Interesting? The message is clear but maybe not very engaging for someone with an active imagination who prefers original ideas. It feels a bit generic. So maybe a 3, neutral to slightly disagree.

3. I believe the ad is good: Do I trust this ad? It's straightforward and makes sense, especially since it's about staying alert and looking good, which are important in work and social settings. But given my tendency to be careful and thorough, I might not fully trust a single product to solve all these issues. So maybe a 4.

4. I find the ad attractive: Attractiveness is about whether it draws me visually or emotionally. The message is clear but lacks visual appeal if the ad isn't creative. Since I have an active imagination and like originality, a simple message might not be very attractive to me. Maybe a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product: Intention depends on need and belief in the product. If I feel tired often, maybe it's useful. But since the ad is prevention-focused, it makes me think about potential issues without the drink. But given that I'm thorough, I might consider it, but not strongly. Maybe a 4.

2. I will try to buy this product: Trying requires more than just consideration; it needs motivation. Without seeing evidence or trying it, maybe a 3, neutral.

3. I will consider buying this product: Considering is part of the process. Since I make plans and follow through, I might add it to my list but not rush out to buy. So perhaps a 4.

Wait, let me double-check. As a blue-collar worker with high income, maybe I'm looking for something reliable and effective without being too flashy. The ad's focus on tiredness and appearance could resonate because looking good is important in professional settings. My tendency to be thorough might make me consider the product as part of my routine.

But then again, I'm reserved and sometimes disagree with being talkative. So maybe the social aspect isn't a huge driver for me. The emotional appeal here is moderate, focusing on personal appearance and energy levels, which are practical concerns rather than social ones.

I think my scores might be:

Ad attitude: 4, 3, 4, 3
Purchase intention: 4, 3, 4

Yes, that makes sense because while I'm not strongly drawn to the ad, there's enough relevance to consider it but not enough to feel a strong intent or find it particularly interesting.
