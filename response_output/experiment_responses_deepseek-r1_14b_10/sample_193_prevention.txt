Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad targets tiredness and dull appearance, which are relatable, especially after a long day. But since I'm not particularly outgoing or talkative, I might not feel it's directly relevant to me. So, a 3.
   
2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but lacks creativity. It doesn't grab my attention beyond the basic premise. A 4 seems fair.

3. **Good**: While the concept is straightforward, it feels a bit generic. I don't see anything innovative here, so a 4 again.

4. **Attractive**: The ad doesn't stand out visually or emotionally to me. It's more about functionality than appeal. A 3 makes sense.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: Despite the message, I'm cautious about ads making emotional appeals without substance. My tendency towards being careless and trusting neutralizes this to a 4.
   
2. **Try to buy**: I might not rush to try it but won't dismiss it outright. So, a middle ground at 4.

3. **Consider buying**: The ad does make me think about the product's benefits, so considering it is possible. A 5 reflects that mild consideration.

Overall, the scores balance my personality traits and how I perceive the ad's effectiveness.
