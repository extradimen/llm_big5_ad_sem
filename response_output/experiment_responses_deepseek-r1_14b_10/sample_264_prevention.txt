Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

Starting with the ad attitude. The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

1. **I like the ad. (1)**: Strongly Disagree. The ad feels a bit negative and manipulative to me. It's implying that without their product, something bad will happen, which I don't find appealing.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting. (1)**: Still a 1. While it's trying to create a scenario, it doesn't spark my interest because it focuses on negatives like tiredness and looking dull.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (2)**: A bit higher than before but still low. It's somewhat effective in making me aware of the product, but I don't trust the approach as it seems fear-based.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (1)**: Again, a 1. The message doesn't attract me; instead, it feels more like an attempt to pressure me into buying.

Moving on to purchase intention:

5. **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: Neutral leaning towards Disagree. While the idea of not feeling tired is appealing, the way the ad presents itself makes me skeptical about the product's actual benefits.

6. **I will try to buy this product. (3)**: Still a 3. There's some consideration because staying energetic is important, but the ad's approach doesn't fully convince me it's worth trying.

7. **I will consider buying this product. (4)**: Here I'm slightly more inclined to agree. The message touches on something relevant, so it gets a higher score even though my overall feelings about the ad aren't positive.
