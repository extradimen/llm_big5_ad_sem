Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: I'm a reserved person (Strongly Disagree), but the ad is energetic which might not align with my personality. However, staying energized and looking good appeals to me because of my busy office job. The ad seems positive, so it's somewhat interesting and I don't dislike it, but not strongly enough to give high scores.

For purchase intention: My tendency to be careless (Strongly Agree) might make me less likely to follow through on buying the product. Plus, I'm skeptical about ads making grand claims without evidence. However, the benefits mentioned are tempting, so while I'm not convinced yet, I might consider it if others recommend it.

The scores reflect a middle groundâ€”neither strongly agreeing nor disagreeing but leaning towards neutral or slightly negative.
