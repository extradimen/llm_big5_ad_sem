Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down how my profile would influence my response.

First, looking at the demographic info: I'm from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work in another field, am divorced, and earn between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income for someone my age in Vietnam. Wait, no, actually, since it's in VND, that's still a significant amount even though I'm under 20 with a postgraduate degree.

Now, personality traits: 

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing, sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree
- Generally trusting: Agree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Gets nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So, I'm outgoing and helpful but also sometimes rude. I make plans thoroughly but can be careless. My emotions are unstable, which might affect how I perceive the ad.

The ad's key points are energy and looking good daily. Since I'm outgoing and sociable, staying energized is important for my social life. The idea of looking my best would appeal to me because being presentable matters when engaging with others.

However, I tend to be careless, which might make me overlook the importance of consistent routines like taking a drink every day. Also, being sometimes rude could mean I'm more critical of claims that seem too good to be true. The ad's promise is quite strongâ€”helping stay energized and look good daily. That might come off as too ambitious or even manipulative.

My high income suggests I can afford such products, but my tendency towards carelessness makes me less likely to stick with a routine that requires daily intake. Plus, the emotional instability could make me more skeptical about long-term effects of such products.

On the other hand, being helpful and trusting might make me more open to trying something that claims positive outcomes for myself and others. My active imagination and originality in ideas could also mean I'm more willing to explore new products, but combined with being sometimes rude, I might be critical of the ad's approach.

Considering all this, I think the ad would have mixed appeal. It touches on points that matter to me (energy for socializing, looking good), but the claims are strong, and my personality makes me wary of over-promises. My income allows me to consider purchasing, but my carelessness might prevent consistent use, affecting purchase intention.

So, evaluating the ad's attitude scores:

1. Like: I'm somewhat interested but not overly fond.
2. Interesting: The idea is intriguing given my social life.
3. Good: It makes sense for someone like me, so neutral to slightly agree.
4. Attractive: The message is appealing visually and conceptually.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend: High income allows consideration, but I'm not sure yet.
2. Try: Might give it a shot due to the benefits mentioned.
3. Consider: Definitely on my mind as an option.

Overall, the ad resonates somewhat but isn't compelling enough for immediate action because of the over-the-top claims and my personality traits.
