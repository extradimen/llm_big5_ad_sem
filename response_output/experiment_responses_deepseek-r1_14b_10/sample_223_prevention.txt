Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let me start by breaking down their demographic and personality traits.

They're from China, over 60 years old, a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree, single, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. That's interesting because it's a bit contradictoryâ€”having a high education but working in a blue-collar job, which might mean they have the knowledge but perhaps not the income to spend on luxury items.

Personality-wise, they're talkative but not outgoing, so maybe they prefer engaging in conversations rather than being around large groups. They're very helpful and unselfish, which suggests they value community and trust. However, they sometimes feel rude, which might make them cautious or direct in their interactions. They are thorough and planful, which indicates they like structure and may be methodical in their decisions.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key here is that it's positioned as a preventive measure against feeling tired and looking dull. Since the person is over 60, maybe fatigue is something they experience more often, especially given their job as a blue-collar worker, which might be physically demanding.

The ad is trying to appeal to someone who wants to maintain energy levels and appear vibrant. Given that the person is talkative and helpful, they might appreciate products that help them stay energetic and present in social interactions. The fact that it's about looking dull could also resonate if they value their appearance and how others perceive them.

However, considering their reserved nature, maybe the ad feels a bit too pushy or focused on external appearances. They are more about being helpful and unselfish rather than seeking attention for themselves. So while they might understand the message, it's possible they don't feel a strong emotional connection to it.

Looking at purchase intention: The person is methodical (makes plans, thorough) so they might not rush into buying something just because of an ad. They might want more information or see if others recommend it. Also, with their income level, they might be cautious about spending on such products unless convinced of the benefits.

So for attitude toward the ad: The message is clear but might not align perfectly with their values. They might find it interesting and good because it addresses real concerns, but maybe not extremely attractive or likable since it's focused on looking dull, which they might see as more about external image than intrinsic qualities.

For purchase intention: They're thoughtful and planful, so they might consider buying it, especially if the ad's message resonates with their desire to stay energetic. But without a strong emotional tie, they might not feel compelled to buy immediately.
