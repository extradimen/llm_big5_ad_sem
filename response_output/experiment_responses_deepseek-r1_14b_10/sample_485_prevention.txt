Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My goal is to evaluate this as a 50-59 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree who is currently a student, divorced, earns less than 15 million VND monthly. I also have certain personality traits that might influence my reaction.

Starting with the ad itself: It's targeting people who want to stay alert and look good. Given my age, maybe I'm more concerned about staying energetic and looking presentable, especially since I'm a student. But wait, as a postgraduate student, I'm probably juggling studies and other responsibilities, so feeling tired is relatable.

The ad uses fear of tiredness and appearing dull as a motivator. That might resonate with me because I want to maintain my appearance and efficiency. However, the message feels a bit generic. It doesn't specify how the drink helps or what makes it unique. So, while the idea is good, the execution is too vague.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The concept is okay, but without specifics, it's not very compelling. Maybe a 3.
2. Is it interesting? It touches on common concerns, so maybe a 4.
3. Is it good? It has potential but lacks depth; perhaps a 4.
4. Is it attractive? Not really, since it's too broad and doesn't create an emotional connection. So, a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm not convinced enough. A 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if reminded again, but still unsure. Another 3.
3. Consider buying: It did make me think about it, so maybe a 4.

I should also consider my personality traits. I'm talkative and outgoing, which makes me more open to such messages. But being careful (disagree on careless) and worried a lot means I might be skeptical of quick fixes. The ad doesn't provide enough evidence or details, so it's hard to trust fully.
