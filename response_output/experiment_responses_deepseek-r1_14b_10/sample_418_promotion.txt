Alright, let me try to figure out how I would respond to this ad based on my given profile. So first, I need to understand what the ad is saying: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It seems like it's targeting people who want both energy and looking good as daily benefits.

Given my background, I'm a 40-49 year old man from China with a high school education, currently a student, married, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I am generally trusting but not very talkative or outgoing. I make plans and follow through, so I'm pretty goal-oriented. However, I don't have an active imagination or come up with new ideas often, and I have few artistic interests.

So, starting with the ad's attitude scores:

1. I like the ad: The ad is promoting a drink that offers energy and helps in looking good. Since I make plans and follow through, maybe this drink can help me stay focused on my studies or daily tasks. But the part about looking good might not resonate as much since I'm more focused on functionality. Plus, being reserved, I might not be too interested in something related to looking good. So, I don't think I'd like it a lot—maybe around 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting: The idea of staying energized is appealing, especially for students who need focus. But the part about looking your best seems more targeted towards younger or different demographics. Since my interests lean more towards practicality than appearance, I might not find it too interesting. Maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good: The claims seem straightforward and positive. However, without specific evidence or details on how the drink achieves these effects, I'm not sure if I fully trust it. Trust is important to me, so maybe a 5 because I can see the benefits but lack concrete info makes it less convincing.

4. I find the ad attractive: The ad's message is positive and everyone wants energy and to look good. But since my primary focus isn't on appearance, I might not find it particularly visually or emotionally appealing. So perhaps a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product: While staying energized is important, especially with studies, the ad doesn't offer enough specific benefits or evidence for me to feel strongly about buying it. My intent is low—maybe a 2.

2. I will try to buy this product: Without strong motivation or trust in the product's effectiveness, I'm not likely to go out of my way to try it. So maybe around 3, but leaning towards lower.

3. I will consider buying this product: It's an option if it's available and perhaps recommended by others, but I don't have a strong desire to purchase it. Maybe a 4 because it's somewhat in the realm of possibility, but not a high priority.
