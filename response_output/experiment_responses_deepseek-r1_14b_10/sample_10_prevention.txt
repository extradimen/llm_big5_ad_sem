Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." And then score my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention based on my demographic profile and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad's message. It's using a fear appeal, suggesting that without this drink, negative consequences like feeling tired and looking dull will happen. That makes me think about how effective such appeals are, especially for someone with my background and personality.

Looking at my demographics: I'm from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work as a managerial employee, divorced, earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. Hmm, that's quite a high income for my age, but maybe common in certain industries or family backgrounds.

Personality traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree), outgoing and sociable (neutral), reserved (strongly agree). So, on one hand, being talkative might make me more interested in products that boost social interactions. But being reserved could mean I don't rely heavily on such products to feel confident.

I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), generally trusting (agree), sometimes rude (agree). This mix suggests I value social harmony but might not always be the most approachable, which could relate to how I perceive products aimed at improving social appearances.

I do a thorough job (neutral), make plans and follow through (agree), tend to be careless (disagree). So planning is important for me, but maybe this ad isn't leveraging that trait directly. Worrying a lot (strongly agree) and having an active imagination (strongly agree) means I might overthink things, which could make fear-based ads more impactful.

Now, looking at the ad's effectiveness. The message focuses on avoiding tiredness and dull looks. For someone with high income, maybe this is targeting their desire to maintain a certain image or energy levels. But since I'm reserved, I might not feel as pressured to fit into social appearances in the same way others might.

The fear appeal could play into my tendency to worry a lot, making me consider that without this drink, negative outcomes would occur. However, being talkative and outgoing (though neutral) might mean I don't feel the need for such products to be more sociable. Plus, being helpful and unselfish suggests I might prioritize practicality over luxury items.

On purchase intention: The ad is trying to create a necessity where without it, something bad happens. But I'm not sure if that's enough to make me actually buy the product. Maybe I'd consider it, but intending or trying would require more persuasion.

I think my态度 toward the ad would be somewhat neutral because while the fear appeal might resonate due to my tendency to worry, my reserved nature and high income might make me question the necessity rather than feel compelled. But since I have an active imagination, maybe the ad is somewhat interesting. However, whether it's good or attractive depends on how well it aligns with my values.

Purchase intention: Since the ad doesn't directly address any specific need I have right now, and given that I'm cautious (agreeing to being sometimes rude but also caring about thoroughness), I might not intend to purchase immediately. But considering buying could be a possibility if the product seems beneficial enough.
