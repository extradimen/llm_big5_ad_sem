Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: Given that I'm reserved and tend to worry a lot, I don't find the ad particularly appealing. It seems too generic and doesn't resonate with me on a personal level. So, I scored it a 2.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message about staying energized and looking good is somewhat relevant, but without any emotional hook or specific benefits, it's not very engaging. A score of 3 seems appropriate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the ad has a positive message, I don't think it's particularly well-crafted. It lacks depth and doesn't connect with my personality traits. Hence, a 3 here as well.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Visually, the ad might look appealing, but the content doesn't speak to me. My reserved nature makes me less drawn to such general ads. I gave it a 2.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Since I'm cautious and not easily persuaded by generic claims, I don't feel compelled to buy. A score of 3 reflects my neutral stance.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: There's no strong incentive for me to take action. Without a personal connection or specific benefits highlighted, trying the product isn't something I'm inclined towards. Another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While the ad mentions staying energized and looking good, which are somewhat appealing, my tendency to be careless and not make thorough plans makes me less likely to consider it seriously. A score of 2 feels right.

Overall, the ad doesn't align well with my personality or needs, leading to low scores across both attitude and purchase intentions.
