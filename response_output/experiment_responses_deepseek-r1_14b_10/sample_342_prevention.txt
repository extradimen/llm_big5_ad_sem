Alright, let me think through this. So I'm supposed to evaluate how someone with a specific demographic and personality traits would respond to an advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, looking at the person's background: they're from China, female, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, are a student, divorced, and earns between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income for a student in Vietnam, which is interesting. They’re also a student with a postgrad degree, so maybe they're quite focused or come from a wealthy background.

Personality traits: She's reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), not trusting (Strongly Disagree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), doesn't do thorough jobs (Disagree), makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), isn't careless (Strongly Disagree), not nervous easily (Disagree), doesn't worry a lot (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), has an active imagination (Neutral), original with new ideas (Agree), but has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree).

So, she's someone who is quite self-sufficient, possibly introverted, reliable in keeping plans, not very trusting. She's stable emotionally and values being helpful. But she doesn't have a lot of artistic interests.

Now, the ad's message: Without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. It seems to be targeting people who want to stay energized and presentable. So, it's about preventing tiredness and looking good.

Considering her personality: She's reserved, so she might not be very interested in social ads that focus on being outgoing or sociable. But since the ad is about staying alert and looking good, which relates more to personal well-being rather than social interactions.

She is helpful and unselfish, which makes me think she values products that have a positive impact, maybe health-related? But the ad is more about personal appearance and energy levels. 

She's not trusting of people but is reliable herself. So, does she trust ads? Maybe she would be skeptical. If the ad makes strong claims without evidence, she might distrust it.

She doesn't get nervous easily and isn't worried a lot, so maybe stress-related messages wouldn't resonate as much. But feeling tired could still be a concern if it affects her studies or plans.

Emotionally stable and has an active imagination but not very artistic. So, the ad's message is more about functionality than creativity. Maybe she would appreciate that.

Since she makes thorough plans and follows through, she might value products that help her maintain focus and energy to stick with her plans.

Putting it together: The ad talks about preventing tiredness and looking dull. She's someone who values being reliable and not letting things affect her negatively. So, the message of staying energized and presentable aligns with her desire for stability and reliability. But she might be skeptical of the ad's claims unless there's evidence or a clear benefit.

So, in terms of attitude toward the ad: She might find it somewhat interesting because it addresses personal well-being, but she might not strongly like it if she doesn't see immediate relevance or is skeptical about its effectiveness. Since she has high income, maybe she’s more willing to try products, but her skepticism could lower her intent.

Purchase intention: Given her high income and the ad's focus on staying alert and looking good, she might consider buying it, especially if she feels tired often. But since she's not someone who is easily swayed by ads, her intention might be moderate.
