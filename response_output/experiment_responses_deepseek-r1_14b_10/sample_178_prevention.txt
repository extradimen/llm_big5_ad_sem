Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. So first, they have a demographic profile: Chinese, male, under 20, high school education, blue-collar worker, single, and earns between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's actually a pretty decent income for a blue-collar worker in China. Interesting.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Agree
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Artistic interests: Neutral

So putting this together: He's not talkative but is outgoing and reserved. Hmm, maybe he's more of an introverted extrovert? He's helpful, so community-oriented, but not trusting. He's sometimes rude, which might make him seem tough or not caring, but he's also careless and not thorough, which could mean he doesn't put much thought into things. His imagination is active, so he likes creative stuff.

Now the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention message, targeting potential negative outcomes without the product.

First, attitude toward the ad:

1. Like it? Maybe not if he's not into the message or the style.
2. Interesting? Depends on whether he relates to feeling tired or looking dull.
3. Good? If the ad is effective in conveying its message but his personality might make him skeptical.
4. Attractive? If the visuals and message appeal to him.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Maybe not, since prevention ads can be seen as manipulative.
2. Try to buy: Possibly if the ad makes a strong case.
3. Consider buying: He's careless but has an active imagination; might think about it.

Given his traits: he's helpful and unselfish, so maybe likes ads that help others? But being not trusting and sometimes rude, he might find the ad too pushy or manipulative. Also, being careless, perhaps doesn't see the need immediately.

So for attitude scores:

1. Like - probably Neutral (4)
2. Interesting - Maybe Disagree (3) because he's not sure if it applies to him.
3. Good - Neutral (4), as it's a simple message but might not be compelling.
4. Attractive - Disagree (3), since the ad might not appeal visually or emotionally.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend - Neutral (4), maybe leans towards 5, but given his carelessness, perhaps 5?
2. Try to buy - Agree (6), if he's convinced about the benefits.
3. Consider buying - Strongly Agree (7), because even though he might not act immediately, he'll think about it.

Wait, that doesn't quite add up. Maybe:

For ad attitude:
1. Like: 5
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 4
4. Attractive: 5

But considering his tendency to be careless and sometimes rude, perhaps he's more neutral on like and interesting.

Purchase intention might be lower because prevention ads target negative emotions, which he's not too worried about (he's emotionally stable? No, wait, he's strongly disagree with being emotionally stable. So maybe he does worry but doesn't show it.)

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe the ad would resonate if he feels tired, but his personality makes him skeptical of such claims.

After thinking, perhaps:

Ad attitude scores: [3, 4, 5, 6] ? Wait no, scale is 1-7.

Wait, initial response was [5,4,5,5], but let me adjust based on the traits. He's strongly disagree with being trusting and emotionally stable, so maybe the ad feels manipulative to him.

So he might not like it (2), find it interesting (3), think it's good (3), and not attractive (1). That seems too harsh. Alternatively:

He is outgoing but reserved, perhaps doesn't connect emotionally with ads that are too pushy. He has an active imagination but may see the ad as lacking depth.

So maybe:

Ad attitude: 4,4,4,5?

Purchase intention: He's careless and might not be convinced by the ad, so low scores.

Alternatively, he's helpful, so likes the idea of being tired without the drink? Maybe he finds it somewhat good but not compelling.

I think I'll go with:

Ad attitude scores: [3,4,4,5]
Purchase intention: [4,5,6]

Wait, no. Let me try again. He is outgoing and helpful, so maybe the ad's message of feeling tired without it might resonate a bit. But he's not trusting and sometimes rude, so may not fully agree.

So:

Ad attitude scores: 3 (like), 4 (interesting), 5 (good), 6 (attractive)
Purchase intention: 4 (intend), 5 (try), 6 (consider)

Wait, but earlier I thought he might be neutral. Maybe it's better to give lower scores.

Alternatively:

Ad attitude: [3,4,5,6]
Purchase: [3,4,5]

No, perhaps a more balanced approach considering his traits:

He is strongly agree with having an active imagination, which might make the ad more interesting and good. So maybe higher on those.

So, like: 4
Interesting:5
Good:5
Attractive:5

Purchase intention:
Intend:3
Try:4
Consider:5

Because he's somewhat persuaded but not strongly intending to buy.
