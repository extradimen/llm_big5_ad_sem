Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese man over 60 with a blue-collar job would feel about the ad. He's reserved and helpful but doesn't like being talkative or outgoing. The ad says without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. 

First, he's reserved, so maybe the ad isn't for someone who's quiet. But feeling tired is something everyone can relate to, especially with a busy job. He makes thorough plans and isn't careless, so he probably values products that work as they claim.

The ad seems to target looking good and feeling energetic. Since he might worry a lot and not be very trusting, the credibility of the ad matters. If it's too pushy or doesn't show proof, he might not trust it.

Considering his income is low, maybe the price of the drink isn't an issue if it's affordable. But does he care about looking dull? Being reserved, perhaps not as much as someone more outgoing would.

He worries a lot and isn't emotionally stable, so the ad's message might play on those fears. However, being thorough, he'd probably want evidence that the drink actually works before considering purchase.

His personality is cautious and reserved. The ad's claim seems straightforward but might feel a bit manipulative if it's too direct. He might not find it very interesting or appealing since his main concerns are more about practicality than appearance.

So, for attitude towards the ad: he doesn't like it much because it feels irrelevant to his personality traits and maybe a bit pushy. For purchase intention, he's cautious but might consider it if convinced of its benefits, so a low score there too.
