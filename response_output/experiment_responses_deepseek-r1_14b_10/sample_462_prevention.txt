Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So first, looking at her demographic profile: she's from China, over 60, has a bachelorâ€™s degree, works in management, is divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's helpful, trusting, thorough, makes plans, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, stable emotionally, imaginative, original, but not very artistic.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, so it's targeting people who want to stay energized and appear lively. Given her age, she might be concerned about staying active and looking good as she gets older. Her personality traits like being thorough and making plans suggest she values efficiency and effectiveness in products.

She agreed that she sometimes worries a lot and gets nervous easily, so the ad's message could resonate with her need to manage stress and maintain energy levels. The ad is straightforward, focusing on preventing tiredness and dull looks, which might appeal to someone who wants to stay alert and presentable.

However, considering her income level is less than 15 million VND, she might be budget-conscious. If the drink is expensive, that could be a barrier for her. Also, she's original and imaginative but agreed she has few artistic interests, so maybe the ad needs more creative elements to capture her attention fully.

She found herself agreeable in trusting others but also sometimes rude, which doesn't directly relate to the product but shows she can be cautious in social interactions. Since she's thorough, she might look for detailed information about the drink's benefits and ingredients before considering a purchase.

Her emotional stability combined with high worry levels means she's sensitive to messages that address her well-being. The ad could play into her desire to maintain energy and appear youthful, which are important at any age but especially as one gets older.

So, in terms of attitude toward the ad: she might find it interesting because it addresses real concerns about tiredness and appearance. She believes it's good if it provides clear benefits, finds it attractive if it's presented well, and likes it if it aligns with her values of taking care of herself.

For purchase intention: she intends to buy if the drink meets her needs, tries it if convinced by the ad, and considers it as an option among others. But given her budget, she might not rush into buying unless there's a strong reason or discount.

Overall, the ad could be somewhat persuasive but might need additional information about cost-effectiveness and benefits to fully engage her.
