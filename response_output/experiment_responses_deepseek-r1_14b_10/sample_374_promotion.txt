Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions based on their demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad: It says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, it's targeting people who want energy and a good appearance. Now, considering the person is over 60, from China, with a bachelorâ€™s degree, works in an office, is divorced, and has a monthly income under 15 million VND.

Looking at his personality traits: He's talkative (strongly agrees), outgoing? No, he strongly disagrees. Reserved? He disagrees, so maybe not too reserved. Helpful and unselfish? Neutral. Trusting? Disagrees, which might mean he's cautious. Sometimes rude? Agrees a bit. Thorough job? Doesn't think so. Plans and follows through? Strongly disagrees. Careless? No. Gets nervous or worried easily? Not really. Emotionally stable? Also no. Has an active imagination? Neutral. Original and comes up with new ideas? Agree. Artistic interests? He agrees he has few.

So, his personality: talkative but not outgoing, maybe a bit reserved, cautious, sometimes rude, not very thorough, doesn't make plans well, not emotionally stable, original but not very artistic. 

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad. Since he's over 60 and might be more traditional, does an ad that focuses on energy and looking good appeal? Maybe not as much as a younger person. He might find it irrelevant because he might not prioritize staying energized in the same way or looking his best through drinks.

2. Interesting: The message is about daily benefits, but being over 60, maybe health aspects are more important to him. However, if the ad doesn't emphasize health benefits and just focuses on energy and appearance, it might not be as interesting to him.

3. Good: He's cautious (doesn't trust easily) so he might question the credibility of the ad. If the ad makes strong claims without evidence, he might not find it trustworthy or good.

4. Attractive: The ad sounds positive, but if the visuals are targeted towards younger people, maybe not as attractive to him. Plus, his personality traits don't lean towards being outgoing or social, so the "look your best" part might not resonate much.

Purchase intentions:

1. Intend to purchase: If he doesn't find the ad appealing or relevant, he's unlikely to intend buying it.

2. Try to buy: Unless there's a strong reason or evidence presented, maybe he's hesitant to try something new, especially if he's cautious.

3. Consider buying: Even if he doesn't immediately want to buy, he might think about it if the ad provides specific benefits that align with his needs, like health or energy, but given his personality, maybe not.

So putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores would likely be low across the board because he finds it unappealing and uninteresting. Purchase intentions are also low as he's not motivated to buy based on the ad.
