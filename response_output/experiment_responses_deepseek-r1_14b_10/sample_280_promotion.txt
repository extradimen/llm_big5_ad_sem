Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My background is that I'm a 60+ year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, married, earning over 46 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm reserved, neutral in helpfulness and trustiness, sometimes careless, get nervous easily, worry a lot, have an active imagination, and like to come up with new ideas but don't have few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is promoting energy and looking good daily, which seems appealing for someone who values staying active and presentable. However, being reserved, I might not be immediately drawn to such a bold claim without more evidence. So maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** It targets energy and appearance, which are relevant but perhaps too vague. My reserved nature makes me cautious about such general statements. Maybe a 4?

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Belief in the ad's message requires trust, which I'm not strong on (Strongly Disagree). So maybe a low score here, like 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The idea of looking best every day might appeal to me, but my personality leans towards neutrality unless it resonates deeply. Perhaps a 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Without seeing evidence or knowing more about the drink's benefits, I'm hesitant. Maybe a 2.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying might require overcoming initial skepticism, so maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering is neutral but leaning towards yes if more info comes up. So perhaps a 4?

Wait, that might not align perfectly. Let me rethink:

For ad态度:
1. Like: The message is positive but too generic for my reserved nature – maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme, so neutral with a slight edge to interesting – 4?
3. Belief: Trust issues make this low – 2.
4. Attractive: Maybe not visually appealing described textually, so 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Without trust or evidence, low – 2.
2. Try: Might consider it but not sure – maybe a 3.
3. Consider: Neutral but leaning towards yes if convinced – 4?

Hmm, perhaps adjusting based on how the ad's message aligns with my values of looking good and staying energized despite being reserved. Maybe higher scores for attraction and considering buying.

Final thought:
Ad态度 scores: [3,4,2,5] (since maybe I find it more attractive if it resonates with appearance)
Purchase intention: [3,4,5]

Wait, perhaps I overcomplicated. Let me assign based on initial thoughts.
