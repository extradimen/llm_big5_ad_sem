Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the scores for this ad. 

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, these benefits might appeal to me in supporting my daily responsibilities. However, the language feels a bit generic. I don't feel a strong personal connection or enthusiasm towards it, so I'd give it a 4.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but lacks any unique angle or story that would make it stand out. It doesn't spark much interest beyond the basic benefits mentioned. A middle score of 3 seems appropriate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the ad isn't particularly engaging, it does convey positive benefits. However, without strong emotional appeal or specific details, my belief in its effectiveness is lukewarm. A 4 feels right here.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual and wording are basic. There's no compelling imagery or creative elements to draw me in. I'd rate this a 3 as it doesn't attract me strongly.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The ad highlights two main benefits, which is good. But without specific evidence or more detailed information about the product's ingredients or effectiveness, my intent isn't very high. A 4 seems fair.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Since I'm on a tight budget and there are many similar products available, I'm not compelled to try it immediately. There's no strong reason over others, so I'll score this a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: The ad does make me think about the benefits, but without more information or a compelling reason, my consideration is moderate. A 4 feels accurate here as it's on my radar but not a priority.

Overall, while the ad isn't terrible, it doesn't quite hit the mark for me personally, and budget constraints also play a role in my lower intent scores.
