Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Given that the person is outgoing and talkative, they might appreciate an energetic message. The promise of energy aligns with their active lifestyle, so a 5 seems fair.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Since she has an active imagination and is original, the ad's catchy message could be seen as interesting. A 4 here reflects moderate interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The core benefits are clear, but without specific evidence or details, her critical nature might hold back full belief, hence a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - As someone who likes to look her best, the ad's message appeals to her vanity, so it's more attractive than not, scoring a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - She tends to make plans and follow through, but she's also careful. The ad lacks specifics, so her intent is moderate at 5.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - With an intention to consider, trying it might be a step, but not certain yet, so another 5.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - She worries a lot and is careful, so considering makes sense as she evaluates the options, scoring a 6.
