Okay, so I'm evaluating this advertisement that says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break it down based on my background and personality.

First, my attitude toward the ad. 

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, not really. The tagline is a bit generic. It doesn't stand out to me. I don't feel any strong connection or excitement from it. So maybe a 3 on a scale of 1 to 7.

2. Is it interesting? Well, staying energized and looking good are important, but the way it's phrased is pretty standard. Nothing too intriguing here. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's clear, but maybe too vague. It doesn't provide any specific benefits or reasons why someone should choose this drink over others. So perhaps a 5.

4. Is it attractive? The message is positive, which is nice, but without visuals or more details, it feels a bit plain. A 5 here.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy the product? I'm not convinced enough by just this ad. There's no mention of taste, price, or any unique selling points. So probably a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? Maybe if I saw more ads or had more information, but based on this alone, I don't feel compelled. A 4.

3. Would I consider buying it? It's possible, but not likely without more info. Perhaps a 5.
