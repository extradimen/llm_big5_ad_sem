Alright, let me break down my thought process for evaluating this advertisement.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I'm a single female student over 60 from China with a bachelor's degree. My monthly income is between 26,000,000–35,000,000 VND.

Looking at my personality traits: I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, which might make me consider how this drink can benefit others. However, I strongly disagree with being trusting, so the ad's credibility is something to question. I also tend to be thorough but don't like making plans without following through—so maybe I'll think about it but not act immediately.

The ad mentions staying energized and looking good. Since I'm a student, energy could be important, but I'm not sure how much the drink would help. The phrase "look your best" is vague; it doesn't specify what that means exactly, which might make me doubt its effectiveness.

I don't find the ad particularly interesting or attractive because it lacks specific details and relies on general claims. It feels a bit manipulative without evidence. However, I'm not emotionally stable, so maybe I'm overthinking it? Or perhaps it's just not aligning with my values enough to make me like it.

On purchase intention: I don't intend to buy it right away because of the lack of trust and specifics. But considering that I might try new things if they seem helpful, I could consider it as an option, but I'm not sure yet.
