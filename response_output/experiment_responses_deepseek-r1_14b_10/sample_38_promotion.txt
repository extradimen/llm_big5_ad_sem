Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which aligns with some of my personality traits, especially being thorough and making plans. However, I'm not particularly interested in health drinks, so it's a 3.
2. **Interesting**: It has a catchy message, but nothing too innovative. Maybe a 4.
3. **Good**: The claims are positive, but without specific evidence, it feels generic. A middle score of 4 seems right.
4. **Attractive**: The phrasing is appealing, but I don't find it visually or emotionally engaging enough for a higher score, so another 4.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: Without trust in the brand or more details, my intention isn't strongâ€”probably a 3.
2. **Try to buy**: If available and affordable, I might consider trying once, so maybe a 5.
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar, but not enough to actually purchase yet, so a 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me despite some positive traits mentioned.
