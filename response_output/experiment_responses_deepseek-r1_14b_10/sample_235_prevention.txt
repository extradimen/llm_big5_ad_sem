Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message is about preventing tiredness and maintaining a good appearance. As someone who's reserved and emotionally stable but tends to be careless sometimes, I'm not immediately drawn to the ad.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad. (Disagree)** - I don't have a strong reaction either way, so maybe a 2.
2. **Interesting?** The concept is somewhat common, so not too interesting; perhaps a 3.
3. **Good?** It's functional but not particularly compelling, so another 3.
4. **Attractive?** Not visually or conceptually appealing to me, so I'll go with a 2.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy?** The message is about prevention, which might not be a top priority for me right now. So maybe a 3.
2. **Try to buy?** If it's convenient and fits my routine, I might consider trying once; that's a 4.
3. **Consider buying?** It's possible but not something I'm focused on, so a 4.

I balanced between disagreeing with liking the ad and finding it somewhat okay in other aspects, considering my personality traits like being reserved and sometimes careless. The purchase intentions are moderate because while the message isn't compelling enough to push me, I might give it a shot if prompted.
