Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: it's a prevention message, focusing on avoiding tiredness and dull looks without the drink. 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The message is clear about the negative consequences of not using the product, which aligns with my personality trait of being careful (Agree). However, the ad feels a bit too direct and lacks emotional appeal, so I'm neutral here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   It's straightforward but doesn't really capture my interest because it doesn't offer anything positive or innovative. So, I'm Neutral again.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   The message serves a purpose, but it feels manipulative by highlighting negatives. Plus, there's no emotional connection, so I Disagree slightly.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Since I'm reserved and not outgoing, I don't find ads that are too pushy or direct very attractive. So, Neutral again.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   The message targets my fear of looking tired, which is valid, but without any positive reinforcement, my intent isn't strong. Neutral here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Without a compelling reason or seeing others use it, I'm not motivated enough to try. So, Disagree.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   The ad does make me think about the product's benefits, so I'm somewhat inclined to consider it. Neutral again.
