Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to assess my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intentions based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, I need to consider my own characteristics. I'm a female student from China, under 20, living with parents, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I agree that I'm outgoing, helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, careless, get nervous easily, but emotionally stable and strongly disagree with having an active imagination or original ideas.

Now, looking at the ad: It focuses on energy and appearance. As a student, staying energized could be appealing because of busy schedules. However, the claim to "look your best" might not resonate as much if I don't prioritize appearance over health benefits.

For attitude towards the ad:
1. Do I like it? The message is positive but maybe too generic. It doesn't speak specifically to students or my interests.
2. Interesting? Maybe not, since there's nothing unique about the claims.
3. Good? It seems okay, but without specific details on how it helps, it feels vague.
4. Attractive? Probably a 3 because it uses positive imagery but lacks personal connection.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? No, because I'm not convinced by the claims and have budget constraints.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if it's recommended elsewhere.
3. Consider buying? Possibly, but only after more information or reviews.

So, my scores would reflect a neutral to slightly negative attitude towards the ad and low purchase intentions due to lack of personal relevance and credibility.
