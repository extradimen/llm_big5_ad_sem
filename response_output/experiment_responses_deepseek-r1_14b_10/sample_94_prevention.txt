Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intention based on their given demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience is a Chinese male under 20 who's a high school student working as a civil servant, married, with a monthly income less than 15 million VND. His personality traits include being outgoing but sometimes rude, thorough in his work, careless, gets nervous easily, doesn't worry much, emotionally stable neutral, not very imaginative, and has few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's message: It suggests that without this drink, one might feel tired and look dull. This is likely targeting feelings of social anxiety or the need to appear energetic and presentable. Since the person is outgoing (Agree) but sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), he values social interactions but may not be overly concerned about others' perceptions. However, being a civil servant, appearing professional might be important.

His personality traits like being talkative (Disagree) mean he's more reserved in conversations but still sociable. He tends to be careless (Strongly Agree), which might make him less likely to pay attention to ads unless they strongly resonate. He gets nervous easily (Agree), so products that promise to reduce stress or anxiety could appeal to him.

The ad is about feeling tired and looking dull, which ties into both physical energy and social image. This person might be interested in staying alert and energetic, especially given his job as a civil servant, which likely requires attention to detail and professionalism.

Looking at the questions for ad attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - He's outgoing but not talkative, so maybe he likes ads that are engaging but not overly talkative. The message is clear, so maybe 4/7.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - It's a direct appeal to his need to look good and feel energetic. Since he gets nervous easily, this might be relevant. Maybe 5/7.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - The message is straightforward but may not strongly connect with him because of his carelessness trait. Maybe 4/7.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - As an outgoing person, he might find it somewhat attractive if it's relevant to his needs. Perhaps a 5/7.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's careless (Strongly Agree), so maybe not very intentional. But since he gets nervous, the drink could be useful. Maybe 3/7.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - If it seems helpful for his social and professional needs, he might consider trying it. Perhaps a 4/7.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - He's thorough (Strongly Agree), so even if interested, he'd evaluate options. Maybe a 5/7.

Putting it all together, the scores would reflect moderate interest in the ad and some consideration towards purchasing but not a strong intention.
