Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at their demographic profile: they're a Chinese male over 60, work as a civil servant with a high income, married, and has a high school education. Their personality traits show they are talkative, helpful, trusting, original but not very outgoing or reserved, tends to disagree being rude, neutral on thoroughness and planning, not careless, sometimes nervous, worries a bit, not emotionally stable, and has few artistic interests.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the ad is positioning the drink as something that prevents tiredness and makes you look better. It's targeting people who might be concerned about their energy levels and appearance.

Considering their age group (over 60), they might be looking for products that help with energy or stamina, which could be appealing. They are a civil servant, so maybe their job requires them to stay alert and presentable, making this ad relevant.

Their personality traits: talkative but not very outgoingâ€”maybe they don't socialize much but still value social interactions. Being helpful and trusting suggests they might believe in the product's claims if it seems trustworthy. They worry a bit, which could make them more susceptible to ads that address concerns about tiredness affecting their appearance or work performance.

However, they are neutral on being thorough and planning, so maybe they don't plan purchases too meticulously but still evaluate things thoughtfully. Not being careless might mean they're cautious about trying new products. They also have few artistic interests, which might make the ad's approach to them more practical rather than creative or emotional.

The advertisement is direct, highlighting negative outcomes without the product. This fear-based marketing could resonate with someone who values prevention and maintaining a good appearance. Since they are trusting, the straightforward message might be seen as credible.

On the other hand, being reserved and not very outgoing might make them less likely to be swayed by ads that emphasize social aspects or popularity. Their originality and imagination could mean they prefer products that stand out, but the ad is pretty conventional in its messaging.

In terms of purchase intention, if the ad makes them worry about feeling tired and looking dull, it could prompt them to consider the drink as a solution. However, their cautious nature might make them wait or seek more information before buying. They are worried a bit, so the ad taps into that concern but may not push them over the edge immediately.

So, for attitude toward the ad: It's likely they would find it somewhat interesting and good because it addresses real concerns, but maybe not extremely attractive as it's quite straightforward. Their cautious nature might make their initial reaction neutral to slightly positive.

For purchase intention: They might consider buying it if the ad resonates with them personally, but given their age and possibly more measured approach to purchasing, they'd be in the 'consider' phase rather than an immediate intent or try stage.
