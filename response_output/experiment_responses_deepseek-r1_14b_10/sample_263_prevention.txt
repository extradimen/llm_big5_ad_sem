Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their background and personality. Let me start by understanding who they are.

They're from China, female, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree, work as a blue-collar worker, live with parents, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income for Vietnam, so she might be in a senior position or own her own business.

Her personality traits show that she is outgoing but also reserved. She’s helpful and unselfish, which makes her trustworthy but maybe a bit cautious. However, she doesn't trust people much, which could make her skeptical of ads. She's thorough in her work, which means she values quality, but she doesn’t like making plans or gets careless, so she might prefer products that are straightforward without needing too much planning.

She tends to get nervous and worries a lot, but she's emotionally stable. That mix is interesting—maybe she's someone who looks for stability and reliability in products. She’s not very talkative but is helpful, so maybe she values functionality over social aspects. She doesn’t have an active imagination or original ideas, which might mean she prefers traditional ads that are clear and direct.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target someone's energy levels and appearance. Given her age, she might be concerned about staying energetic and looking good as she ages.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: Since she is cautious and gets nervous, maybe the ad doesn't strongly resonate with her emotionally. She might find it a bit pushy or not relatable enough. So perhaps a 3.
2. Interesting: The message is clear but might not be very engaging to someone who isn’t imaginative. Maybe a 4.
3. Good: The ad's message is straightforward, which she values in products, so maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: If the ad isn't visually appealing or uses fear tactics, she might find it less attractive. Perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She’s thorough and values quality, but the ad doesn’t directly address her needs as a blue-collar worker. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Since she's cautious, she might not rush to try without more info, so maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: She might think about it if others recommend, so perhaps a higher score, like a 5.

I need to make sure the scores reflect her personality accurately. Her being thorough and helpful could mean she weighs decisions carefully but isn't immediately swayed by ads that don’t clearly address her needs.
