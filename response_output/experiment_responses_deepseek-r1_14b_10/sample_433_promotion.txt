Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, I'm reserved but helpful, so maybe it doesn't directly appeal to me. Plus, the claims seem a bit generic without specific benefits.

For purchase intention, while the idea of energy is positive, I'm not convinced by vague promises. My skeptical nature makes me unsure about trying new products unless they have proven results. So, considering buying isn't high on my list right now.
