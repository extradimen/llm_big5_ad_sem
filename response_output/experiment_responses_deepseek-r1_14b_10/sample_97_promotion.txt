Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target demographic is a Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree, married, monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. He's a student, so maybe he's either studying or teaching? His personality traits are important here.

Looking at his personality traits:
- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Agree
- Rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Disagree
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic interests: Agree

So he's reserved, trusting but not helpful. He is thorough and doesn't like to be rude. But he makes plans sometimes? Wait, no, he strongly disagrees with making plans and following through. That's a bit conflicting because being thorough might suggest he's detailed-oriented, but he doesn't follow through.

He gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot. His imagination is active, but he isn't original or into new ideas much. He has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad is about staying energized and looking good. For someone over 60, this might be appealing because it touches on vitality and appearance. However, considering his personality, maybe he's more reserved and perhaps not as concerned with social appearances as younger people. But then again, everyone likes to feel energetic.

His high scores are on being thorough and having an active imagination, which might mean he's analytical. He might question the claims of the ad—does it really help you look your best? How does a drink contribute to looking good?

He strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, so maybe he's more self-focused. But he is trusting, so if the ad comes from a credible source, he might trust it.

His tendency to get nervous easily could make him cautious about new products or claims. Also, his active imagination might lead him to imagine scenarios where the drink works, but since he's not original, he might rely on existing information rather than creating new ideas about the product.

Regarding purchase intention: He strongly disagrees with making plans and following through, which suggests that even if he considers buying it, he might not actually do so. His thoroughness could mean he wants more evidence before purchasing, but his high score on being thorough might also make him pay attention to details in ads.

So for the ad attitude:
1. I like the ad: He's reserved and maybe not emotionally stable, so perhaps neutral towards liking it.
2. Interesting: The idea of energy and looking good is interesting, especially since he has an active imagination—maybe a 4?
3. Good: It depends on how truthful he thinks the claims are. If he's thorough, he might be skeptical—so maybe lower, like a 3.
4. Attractive: Ads that promise vitality could be appealing to someone who values staying energized, but his reserved nature and nervousness might make it not too attractive. Maybe a 5?

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He's thorough, so maybe he needs more info—low intend, like 3.
2. Try to buy: Might consider, but not sure—maybe also 3.
3. Consider buying: Perhaps he's on the fence, so a 4 or 5.

Hmm, this is tricky because his personality has conflicting traits. He's thorough and imaginative but also reserved and not trusting of others' help. Maybe the ad isn't very convincing to him, leading to lower scores for both attitude and purchase intention.
