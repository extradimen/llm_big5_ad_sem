Alright, let's break down how I came up with these scores. First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my demographic background: I'm a postgraduate office worker over 60, divorced, living in China with an income under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I tend to agree on being helpful, have neutral trust levels, sometimes worry a lot, but strongly agree on originality and creativity.

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm over 60, maybe I can relate to feeling tired. The drink might be positioned as an energy booster or something that helps maintain appearance. 

Looking at the ad attitude scores:
1. I like the ad: A 3. It's straightforward but a bit generic. Maybe not very appealing.
2. Interesting: Also a 3. Doesn't stand out much; it's a common health claim.
3. Good: Neutral, so a 4. It has a clear message but doesn't wow me.
4. Attractive: Another 3. Not visually or conceptually engaging enough.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: A 2. I'm not convinced it's necessary for me.
2. Try to buy: Also a 2; maybe if it's recommended elsewhere, but not based on this ad alone.
3. Consider buying: A 4. It might be something I'd think about if others suggest it or if the product gets more reviews.

Overall, while the message isn't unappealing, it doesn't resonate strongly with me, and I'm not convinced enough to buy just from the ad.
