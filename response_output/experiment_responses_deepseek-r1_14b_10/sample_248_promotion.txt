Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to think about each part of the evaluation: four attitude questions towards the ad (like, interesting, good, attractive) and three purchase intention questions (intend, try, consider). Each is scored from 1 to 7.

Starting with my background: I'm a Chinese female under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work in an office, live with parents, and earn between 26â€“35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income, so maybe the product is targeting that demographic.

Personality-wise, I tend to be reserved (Agree), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), make thorough job (Disagree), plan and follow through (Strongly Agree), but also careless (Strongly Agree). I get nervous easily (Agree) and worry a lot (Disagree). My imagination is Neutral, originality is Neutral, and I have strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad focuses on energy and looking good. Since I'm reserved but value looking my best, maybe it's appealing to me. But considering I sometimes find ads manipulative, I might not like it much. So maybe a 3.

2. **Interesting.** The message is clear but generic. It doesn't stand out enough for me to find it interesting. Probably a 4.

3. **Good.** For being good, the ad needs to be truthful and positive. If I'm cynical, I might not see much value here. Maybe a 5, neutral leaning towards disagree.

4. **Attractive.** The visuals or design of the ad matter, but without specifics, it's hard to say. I'm more analytical, so maybe 3.

Purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy:** High price? Since my income is high, maybe affordable, but I'm not convinced by the ad alone. So 5.

2. **Try to buy:** Without strong reasons, probably won't try it. Maybe a 4.

3. **Consider buying:** Might think about it if others recommend or if there's more info. Perhaps a 6.
