Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 50-59-year-old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant. My monthly income is around 26 million to 35 million VND, and I'm divorced. 

Firstly, looking at my personality traits: I'm neutral about being talkative, strongly disagree that I'm outgoing or sociable, slightly disagree about being reserved, disagree with being helpful and unselfish, but strongly agree that I'm trusting. I strongly disagree with being rude, which is good. I thoroughly do jobs, make plans and follow through, so that's positive. Neutral on being careless, disagree on getting nervous easily, agree on worrying a lot, and agree on emotional stability. I strongly disagree with having an active imagination but strongly agree on being original and coming up with new ideas. Also, I have few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Considering my age and background, staying energized might be a concern for someone in their 50s, especially a civil servant who might have a demanding job. The part about looking your best could appeal to me if I'm conscious about my appearance.

Looking at the ad's attitude towards me: Since I'm not outgoing or talkative, an ad that emphasizes social aspects might not resonate. However, the focus on energy and looking good is more personal and less about socializing. 

For purchase intention: My tendency to worry a lot might make me consider health products, but my original and thorough nature makes me skeptical of quick fixes. I'm also trusting, so if the ad is credible, it might influence me.

Scoring:

1. Like the ad? Neutral (4) because it's not bad, but not exciting.
2. Interesting? Neutral (4). It's okay but doesn't stand out.
3. Good? Disagree (3). The message is simple and lacks depth.
4. Attractive? Disagree (3). Not visually appealing or emotionally engaging.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Neutral (4). Possible interest if convinced.
2. Try to buy? Neutral (4). Might consider it but not sure.
3. Consider buying? Agree (5). It's on my mind, but I'm not certain.
