Alright, let's break down why I gave these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: 

1. **I like the ad.** - 4/7. The ad is positive and uses strong imagery, which I can appreciate. However, it doesn't really connect with my personality since I'm not very outgoing or energetic. It feels a bit generic.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - 3/7. While the message is clear, there's nothing particularly unique or compelling about it for me. It just states the benefits without anything that stands out.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - 4/7. The structure and visuals are decent, but again, it doesn't resonate with my personal values or lifestyle. It feels more aimed at a different demographic.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - 5/7. The design elements like colors and visuals might appeal to me on a surface level, making it somewhat attractive despite not fully engaging me.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - 2/7. There's no strong reason for me to buy it; my routine doesn't need such a drink, especially with other options available.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - 3/7. Maybe if the ad keeps appearing or if there's an offer, I might consider giving it a shot out of curiosity.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - 4/7. If someone recommends it or if I see positive reviews, I would think about trying it, but it's not something I'm actively seeking right now.
