Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the demographic profile: they're a Chinese male in his 30s-39s with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker, which is a bit of an anomaly since postgraduates usually go for white-collar jobs. He's divorced and has a monthly income under 15 million VND, so that's about $670 USD, which isn't very high.

Now, his personality traits: he disagrees with being talkative and outgoing, agrees with being reserved. He's neutral on being helpful, strongly disagrees on trusting others, agrees on sometimes being rude, but is thorough in his work. He doesn't make plans well and follows through, so that's a big no for planning. He tends to be careless neutrally, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, isn't stable emotionally, has an inactive imagination, and is neutral about original ideas but disagrees on having few artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting the need to stay energetic and presentable. Given his income level, maybe he's looking for affordable ways to stay alert or improve his appearance without spending too much. His reserved nature might make him not very responsive to social ads, but since he works a blue-collar job, maybe he values products that can help him at work.

Looking at the ad's message: it's about preventing tiredness and dull looks, which could appeal to someone whose job is physically demanding or who wants to maintain a good appearance. However, his tendency to worry a lot (score 7) might make him more susceptible to ads that address potential problems. His being thorough (strongly agree) suggests he would check the product's effectiveness.

His personality traits: He's reserved and sometimes rude, which makes me think he's not easily swayed by overly cheerful ads. But the ad is focused on a problem-solution approach, which might align with his more practical nature. Since he worries a lot, he might be concerned about looking tired or dull, especially if that affects his job performance.

Purchase intention: He scores low on intending to purchase but would consider buying it. Maybe because he's cautious and doesn't make plans easily (strongly disagrees), so even if the ad resonates with him, he's not quick to buy without more thought.

So for attitude towards the ad:
1. Like: Neutral? The message is clear but might not align with his reserved nature.
2. Interesting: Maybe neutral or low because it's a common ad theme.
3. Good: He values thoroughness and effectiveness, so maybe 4?
4. Attractive: Probably not very attractive as he's more reserved.

Purchase intentions:
1. Intend to purchase: Low, maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: Neutral to slightly disagree.
3. Consider buying: Maybe neutral or low.

But I'm not entirely sure about the scores. He's worried a lot and thorough, so maybe higher on belief but lower on action because of his reserved nature and lack of trust in ads.
