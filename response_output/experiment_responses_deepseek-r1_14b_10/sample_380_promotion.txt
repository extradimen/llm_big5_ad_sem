Okay, let's break this down. I'm a Chinese woman in my late thirties, work as a civil servant, married with an income under 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are mostly neutral or disagreeing on being talkative, outgoing, reserved, helpful, trusting, rude, thorough, careful, nervous, emotionally stable, imaginative, original, and artistic.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. I like the ad. - Neutral (4). The message is positive but not specific enough for me to feel strongly about it.
2. Interesting. - Disagree (3). It's a common claim, nothing unique stands out.
3. Good. - Neutral (4). It seems okay but doesn't move me much.
4. Attractive. - Slightly disagree (3). The visuals and message are average.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? - Strongly disagree (2). No compelling reason based on the ad alone.
2. Try to buy? - Disagree (3). Maybe not without more info or a discount.
3. Consider buying? - Neutral (4). It's something I might think about if reminded elsewhere.

I don't feel persuaded by this ad, as it lacks specific benefits and personal appeal for me. My background and personality make me more reserved in reacting to such claims.
