Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, understanding my background: I'm over 60, from China, have a postgraduate degree, am currently a student (which might mean I'm still learning but possibly not earning much), divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I agree with being talkative and original, but also reserved and somewhat disagree on helpfulness. I make thorough plans and follow through, which is positive.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key selling points are energy and looking good daily. 

Starting with my attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - Since I'm talkative and agree with being original, the message might resonate if it's presented in a way that highlights staying active or looking good as part of a routine. However, considering my reserved nature and disagreeing on helpfulness, maybe I'm not overly excited. But the drink sounds practical for energy.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Given that I make plans and follow through, managing daily routines is important. The idea of a drink aiding in both energy and appearance could be appealing, making it interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - For me to believe, the ad needs credibility. Without specific evidence or details on how it works, it's hard to fully trust. So my belief might be neutral.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The combination of energy and looking good could attract me if I value daily appearances and productivity, but being reserved might make me not strongly feel attracted.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My monthly income is low, so cost might be a barrier. Without seeing the price point, it's hard to say, but the ad doesn't provide that info, making me less likely to intend to buy immediately.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Even if interested in the benefits, financial constraints could make me hesitant unless the drink is reasonably priced and marketed as essential for daily routines.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The ad does present a clear benefit, so I might think about it, especially since planning is part of my personality. However, without more info or trust in the brand, consideration might be moderate.
