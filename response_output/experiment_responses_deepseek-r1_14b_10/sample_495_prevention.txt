Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 60+ year old woman from China with a bachelor's degree, working as an office worker and living with my parents. My monthly income is between 16 to 25 million VND.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key here is that it's targeting tiredness and looking dull without the product. Since I'm over 60, energy levels might be a concern. But wait, does the ad really speak to me? It seems like it's using fear of feeling tired and looking bad to sell the drink.

Let me think about my personality traits. I'm outgoing and helpful but not particularly talkative. I tend to be careless and sometimes make plans but don't always follow through. I worry a lot, so ads that play on fears might resonate more. But also, I get nervous easily, which could mean I'm sensitive to such messages.

The ad is trying to create FOMO or maybe just highlighting negatives without the product. It's a bit manipulative in that sense. Does it make me feel like I need this drink to avoid feeling tired and looking bad? Maybe, but I have to consider if I actually feel these issues enough to buy something.

Purchase intention: Do I really want to spend money on a drink for this reason? Maybe not immediately. I might consider it if there's more evidence or if the product is recommended elsewhere.

So, for attitude toward the ad, maybe neutral to slightly positive but not enthusiastic. For purchase intention, probably low because of the manipulative tone and lack of trust in the ad's claims.
