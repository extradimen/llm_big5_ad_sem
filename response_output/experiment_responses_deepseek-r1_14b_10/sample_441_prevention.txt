Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, for the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The ad is trying to create a problem in my mindâ€”feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm reserved and tend to worry a lot ( Agree on worrying), this message might make me anxious. But since I don't usually feel tired unless overworked, it doesn't hit home strongly. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The concept of linking tiredness to appearance could be intriguing. It's a common concern, but I'm not sure if it's presented in an engaging way. Maybe around a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   To assess belief, the message needs credibility. The ad suggests negative outcomes without the drink, which aligns with my tendency to worry. But I might question if this drink is the only solution, so perhaps a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Visual appeal and emotional hook are key. If the ad has imagery that makes me feel tired or showcases others looking vibrant, it could attract attention. Maybe a 4 here.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   While the ad addresses concerns I have about appearance and energy, I'm cautious with purchases. My reserved nature makes me hold back unless convinced otherwise. A 3 seems fair.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   There's some interest, but trying it might require more than just an ad. Maybe a coupon or recommendation would push me, so a 4 is possible if incentives are involved.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Considering is the first step. The message makes me think about it, especially since I worry about looking dull. A 5 feels right because I'm at least pondering it.

Overall, the ad touches on points that resonate with my personality but doesn't fully persuade me without more evidence or incentives.
