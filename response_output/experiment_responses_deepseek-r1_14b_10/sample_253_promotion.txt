Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, looking at the ad itself: it's a drink that claims to keep you energized and look your best every day. As someone over 60 living with parents in China, my priorities might be a bit different.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad. (2)** - The message is positive, but I'm not sure if it's relevant to me since I might not be as focused on looking my best every day as younger people might be.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting. (3)** - It has a good concept, but without more specific benefits tailored to my age group, it feels a bit generic.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4)** - The message is clear and positive, which I appreciate, so I'm moderately convinced by it.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4)** - Visually, if it's well-made with appealing images, it could be attractive. But without seeing the actual ad, it's hard to say, but I'll give it a middle score.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (2)** - While staying energized is good, there are many products out there. Without specific benefits or a strong reason, my intent isn't high.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (3)** - Maybe if it's recommended or if I see others using it, but on its own, not sure.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5)** - It's something I might think about if I hear more positive feedback or if there are promotions available.
