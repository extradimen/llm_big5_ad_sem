Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down their profile and personality traits to understand their reaction.

First, her demographic: she's a Chinese woman in her late twenties with a postgraduate degree working as a managerial employee, making around less than 15 million VND monthly. She's divorced. That gives some context about her lifestyle and responsibilities—she might be juggling work and personal life, maybe looking for products that save time or enhance her appearance.

Personality traits: she is talkative (strongly agrees), outgoing but neutral on being sociable, strongly disagrees with being reserved. So she likes to interact and isn't shy. She's helpful but disagrees, which might mean she's more self-focused. She generally trusts people but sometimes can be rude—maybe she’s a bit guarded in her interactions.

She does thorough jobs neutrally, makes plans neutrally, tends to be careless (agrees), so she might not be the most detail-oriented but isn't overly careless either. Doesn’t get nervous or worry much, which could mean she's under less stress and perhaps more open to new experiences. She has an active imagination and is original with ideas.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and appearance, which are relevant for someone in their late twenties managing work and personal life.

For attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad. She's talkative and outgoing, so she might appreciate an ad that's lively and engaging. Since she has an active imagination and likes new ideas, the message could appeal to her. However, if she's self-focused (disagree on helpfulness), maybe it's not directly targeting her needs but still positive.

2. I think the ad is interesting. The combination of energy and looking good is broad and appealing. Since she's original and imaginative, the concept might catch her interest.

3. I believe the ad is good. She generally trusts people (agree) which helps, but she sometimes worries a lot (strongly disagrees), so maybe she questions the product's effectiveness. The drink's benefits are clear, but without specific evidence, she might not fully trust it.

4. I find the ad attractive. Being outgoing and talkative, she likely finds ads that are energetic and visually appealing attractive. However, if the ad is too over-the-top or generic, she might not be as drawn in.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. She's careless (agrees), so maybe she doesn't prioritize such products. Additionally, without strong trust in the ad's claims beyond her general tendency, she might not feel compelled to buy immediately.

2. I will try to buy this product. Even though she's somewhat trusting, without a compelling reason or evidence, trying it out might not be high on her list. She might need more information or a personal recommendation.

3. I will consider buying this product. Given her active imagination and interest in new ideas, she might give it some thought. The ad speaks to energy and appearance, which are relevant but perhaps not urgent for her.

So, scoring-wise:

Ad态度 scores: 5 (like), 6 (interesting), 4 (good), 5 (attractive). She has mixed feelings—appreciates the message but isn't fully convinced.

Purchase intention scores: 3 (intend), 4 (try), 5 (consider). She's somewhat interested but not highly motivated to buy without more evidence.
