Alright, let me think through this. I'm a male under 20 from China, still in high school and living with my parents, making less than 15 million VND a month. My personality traits show I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), generally trusting (agree), sometimes rude (disagree), thorough (agree), careless (strongly agree), not easily nervous (disagree), emotionally stable (neutral), not very imaginative or original (disagree), and neutral about artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. Well, I'm a teenager who might be interested in staying energized, maybe for school or extracurriculars. The idea of looking good is appealing too. But being careless and not very organized (neutral on making plans), maybe I don't prioritize such products. So, probably a 3.

2. Interesting? It's about energy and appearance, which are relevant to teens. Maybe interesting because it targets my age group. A 4 seems right.

3. Good ad? The message is clear but might feel generic. Not bad, but not outstanding either. I'll give it a 5.

4. Attractive: Ads with benefits for looking good and energy can be visually appealing. If the visuals match these themes, it's attractive. A 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Probably not, since I'm under 20 and might not have the spending power or interest in such products yet. Maybe a 3.

2. Try to buy: If the ad makes me curious, maybe I'd try it once, but likely a lower score, around 4.

3. Consider buying: Considering is possible if others recommend it, but on my own, probably not. A 5 feels right.
