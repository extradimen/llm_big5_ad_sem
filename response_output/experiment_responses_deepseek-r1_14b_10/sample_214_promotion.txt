Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score how much I like the ad (attitude) on four aspects and my purchase intention on three aspects.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Considering my personality, I'm outgoing, talkative, and helpful. The ad's message about energy and looking good appeals to me because it aligns with maintaining a social and active lifestyle. However, being careless (strongly agree) might make me less focused on such ads unless they resonate immediately. But the idea of staying energized is positive, so I think I'd like it—maybe around a 6.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The ad's promise of energy and appearance improvement is intriguing. My active imagination (neutral) might not make me find it extremely interesting, but since it targets my desire to be energetic and presentable, I'll rate it as a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   Believing in the ad's effectiveness depends on how trustworthy it seems. The message is clear, but without specific evidence or details, I might be neutral. However, since I'm generally trusting (agree), I'll lean towards believing it—maybe a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Being outgoing and helpful makes me appreciate ads that promote positive outcomes like looking good and being energetic. The ad seems visually appealing if well-designed, but without knowing the visuals, I'll assume it's attractive enough for a 5.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   My monthly income is high (36–45 million VND), so I can afford such products. The ad speaks to my desire for energy and appearance, which are important for someone in their 20s-29s. However, the ad lacks specific benefits or proof, making me hesitant—I'll score this a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Trying it is more about willingness despite uncertainty. Since I'm open to new ideas (strongly agree on originality) but also tend to be careless, maybe I won't prioritize trying it. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Considering buying means thinking about it as an option. The ad's message is appealing enough for me to think about purchasing, so a higher score—maybe a 5.

Overall, balancing my outgoing nature with the ad's vagueness and my tendency towards carelessness, I'll assign scores that reflect moderate interest and consideration but not strong intent without more info.
