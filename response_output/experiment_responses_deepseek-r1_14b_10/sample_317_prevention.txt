Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The advertisement mentions feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Given my personality traits, being talkative and outgoing are strong points, so I care about appearing energetic and presentable in social settings. However, I'm also somewhat reserved and have an active imagination but struggle with original ideas. The ad targets a common concern but feels a bit generic, which makes me neutral on liking it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: Interesting would depend on how relatable the message is. Since I value being talkative and outgoing, avoiding tiredness is important, but the ad doesn't offer much detail or emotional appeal beyond that. It's somewhat interesting but not compelling enough for a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: For an ad to be good, it needs to resonate deeply or provide value beyond just the product. This ad focuses on prevention of tiredness and dull looks, which are valid concerns, especially for someone in their 30s with a busy life. However, without any emotional depth or unique angle, my belief is a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Attractiveness in an ad can be based on visuals, creativity, and emotional resonance. If the ad's visuals are appealing but the message is basic, I might give it a neutral score. Without more info on the presentation, I'll stick with 4.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My tendency towards being careless and sometimes rude suggests I might not prioritize such products unless there's a strong reason. Plus, my income is high, so I'm selective about where I spend. Intention is low.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong motivation or evidence of the drink's effectiveness beyond tiredness prevention, trying it isn't a priority. Maybe 3 on a scale where 7 is highest, but in our case, 4 seems fair as neutral.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: Considering buying implies I'm not dismissing it outright. Given that I do thorough jobs and sometimes make plans, I might give it some thought but not act immediately. So, a middle score of 4.
