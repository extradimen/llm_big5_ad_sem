Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score how I feel about the ad in terms of attitude and purchase intention using a 7-point scale.

Starting with my demographics: I'm a Chinese male in my 30s, have a postgraduate degree but work as a blue-collar worker. I'm divorced, earning over 46 million VND monthly. That's quite high for Vietnam; maybe I'm in a senior position or own a business?

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing, Sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Agree (so not too reserved but somewhat)
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Rude sometimes: Neutral
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Disagree
- Careless: Agree
- Get nervous easily: Agree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So, I'm talkative and outgoing but somewhat reserved. Not very trusting, sometimes careless, not too worried but get nervous easily. I have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often and have strong artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: It's targeting energy and looking good daily. For someone in their 30s-40s, especially a professional or businessperson, this might resonate as they seek ways to stay energized and presentable.

But wait, I'm a blue-collar worker with a high income. That's a bit conflicting because blue-collar typically doesn't correlate with high income unless it's a specialized role or self-employed.

The ad seems to focus on daily energy and appearance. Since I have an active imagination and enjoy creative things, but I'm not original in ideas. However, the product is about functionality—staying energized and looking good. My traits like being thorough and talkative might make me more susceptible to ads that emphasize benefits.

But my distrustfulness makes me question the ad's claims. Also, sometimes I'm careless, so maybe I won't be as cautious about such products? Or perhaps I worry less but get nervous easily—maybe the energy aspect appeals to managing stress?

On purchase intention: Since I earn a lot, I might have the means, but my distrust makes me skeptical. However, if it's effective, maybe I would consider trying it.

Now scoring:

Ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: The message is appealing but I'm not sure about the claims. Maybe 4.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme, so perhaps 5.
3. Good: Not particularly inspiring, so 4.
4. Attractive: Design-wise, it depends, but if it's visually strong, maybe 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Slightly positive but not certain—maybe 4.
2. Try to buy: Might give it a try—so 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on the list—so 5.

Wait, I need to adjust. Since my personality includes being talkative and outgoing, maybe I'm more influenced by social aspects. But being distrustful might lower the score.

Alternatively, since I have an active imagination and like creativity, perhaps the ad's message is more appealing. But I'm not sure about the product's effectiveness.

Hmm, maybe my scores should reflect moderate interest but not strong purchase intention due to skepticism.
