Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down how I would approach this.

First, looking at my demographic profile: I'm from China, female, under 20, in high school, an office worker, divorced, and earn between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty decent income for Vietnam, considering the average salary is much lower. So maybe this ad targets people who can afford such products.

Now, my personality traits: I'm talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but neutral, reserved also neutral. But I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree). Trusting is neutral, sometimes rude (agree), thorough job neutral, make plans and follow through (agree), careless (agree), not nervous (strongly disagree), emotionally stable (agree), active imagination (strongly agree), original with ideas (agree), few artistic interests (neutral).

So I'm someone who's talkative and helpful but can be a bit careless. I have an active imagination and am good at coming up with new ideas, which might make me more open to creative marketing.

The ad's message is about the negative consequences of not drinking this product—feeling tired and looking dull. It uses fear or FOMO (fear of missing out) tactics. Since I'm in high school and an office worker, maybe I'm already dealing with stress from studies or work. The idea that without the drink, I'd feel tired resonates because I might be someone who wants to stay energetic.

But wait, I tend to be careless and sometimes rude, so maybe ads that highlight negative outcomes are effective for me? Or does it make me think too much about potential problems?

I'm emotionally stable (agree), which might mean I don't get too overwhelmed by such messages. Also, having an active imagination could make the ad more vivid for me, making the consequences seem real.

On the other hand, being talkative and outgoing might mean I care about my appearance and how others perceive me, so looking dull is a concern. If the drink can prevent that, it might appeal to me.

But considering purchase intention: My monthly income is high, but I'm still under 20, which means maybe I don't have much disposable income despite my salary. Plus, being in high school, I might not be making purchasing decisions on my own yet. So even if the ad resonates, I might not act on it immediately.

Also, I'm somewhat careless and make thoroughness neutral—so I might not pay attention to details or question the effectiveness of the product. But having an active imagination could lead me to believe in the product's benefits more than others.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: If the ad is targeted at my age group and addresses a concern about energy and appearance, it might be interesting and good. However, if I find the message too manipulative or fear-based, I might not like it. Since I'm emotionally stable, maybe I don't get overly affected by such ads.

Purchase intention: Even if I believe the ad is good, would I actually intend to buy the product? Maybe not immediately because of financial constraints or skepticism about the claims without more evidence.

So scoring-wise, for attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Like: Neutral might be 4, but since it's fear-based and addresses my concerns, maybe higher.
2. Interesting: Could be 5, as it's a common concern.
3. Good: Maybe 5 or 6 if the message is effective.
4. Attractive: Perhaps 6 because the ad is clear and targets real feelings.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 3 because I might not have the immediate need or funds.
2. Try to buy: Also 3, similar reasoning.
3. Consider buying: Maybe 5, as it's something I could think about later.

But wait, considering my income is quite high, maybe I can afford such products more than others. So perhaps higher scores for purchase intention.

Alternatively, being in high school might mean that even if I have the income, decisions are influenced by peers or parents. Maybe the ad would make me consider it but not necessarily act on it without more influence.

I think I'll settle on the scores as follows.
