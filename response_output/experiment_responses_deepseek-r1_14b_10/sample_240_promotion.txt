Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a Chinese female in my late twenties, work as a civil servant, married with an income around 26-35 million VND per month. I'm reserved, helpful but not too much, don't trust people easily, sometimes careless, and emotionally unstable. Hmm.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, it's targeting energy and appearance. As a civil servant, my job is probably stressful, so staying energized could be appealing. But I'm reserved and not too trusting, so the ad needs to convince me.

Let me think about each part:

1. **I like the ad**: The message seems positive, but I don't know if it's tailored for me. Since I'm reserved, maybe I wouldn't connect emotionally. Score: 3.
   
2. **Interesting**: It talks about energy and looking good, which are relatable. But not unique enough. Maybe a 4.

3. **Good**: Does the ad make sense? It mentions benefits but lacks specifics. Without details, it's hard to trust. So, probably a 4.

4. **Attractive**: The visuals would matter. If it shows people looking good and energetic, maybe it's attractive, but I'm not sure. Maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy**: I'm cautious about products. Without seeing results or trust in the brand, I won't intend to buy immediately. Score: 4.
   
2. **Try to buy**: If it's promoted as healthy and effective, I might consider trying once. Maybe a 5.

3. **Consider buying**: It depends on price and reviews. Since I'm considering my budget and effectiveness, maybe a 6.

Overall, I'm not fully sold but open to more information.
