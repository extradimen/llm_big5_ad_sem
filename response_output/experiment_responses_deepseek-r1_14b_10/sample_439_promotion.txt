Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that claims it helps you stay energized and look your best every day. The user is a Chinese-speaking female student who's under 20, with some unique personality traits.

First, looking at the ad itself: It's promoting a drink with two main benefits—energy and appearance. Since the target audience might be students, who are busy and concerned about their looks, this could be appealing. However, I need to consider how my own personality would influence my reaction to this ad.

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** – The drink's benefits are positive, but being reserved, I might not find it overly exciting. Maybe a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – Energy and looking good are relevant, so perhaps 4.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** – It's straightforward, but without seeing evidence, maybe a 5.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** – Design-wise, if it's colorful and appealing, could be higher, say 6.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – Not sure about its effectiveness, so maybe 3.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** – Might consider if others recommend it, so 4.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** – It's on the list, perhaps a 5.

I'm basing these scores on feeling somewhat neutral towards the ad but considering the possibility of purchase without strong conviction.
