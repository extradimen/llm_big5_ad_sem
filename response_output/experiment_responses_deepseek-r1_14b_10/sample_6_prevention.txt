Okay, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me think through how I, as a 30-39 year old married woman from China with a postgraduate degree and monthly income under 15 million VND, would perceive this ad.

First, the ad seems to be targeting people who are looking to stay energetic and presentable. Since I'm a managerial employee, staying alert and looking good is probably important for my professional life. But does this ad resonate with me?

I score on a scale where 1 is strongly disagree and 7 is strongly agree.

For the ad's attitude:
1. I like the ad.
Hmm, the message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It suggests that the drink can help prevent these negatives. But does this make me feel targeted? Maybe not strongly because there are so many energy drinks out there with similar messages. So maybe a 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
The concept is somewhat generic but touches on common concerns. Not particularly unique, so maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
I don't find it particularly compelling or truthful because it's too vague. It doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence. So perhaps a 3.

4. I find the ad attractive.
The ad is trying to create fear of looking tired, which might make me think twice, but without more appeal, maybe a 4.

Now, purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product.
I don't have a strong intent because there are many alternatives and I'm not convinced by this single message. So probably a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Since it's just an ad without any persuasive evidence or emotional hook, maybe a 4 on trying.

3. I will consider buying this product.
It's something to think about, but not enough to make me rush out to buy it. So perhaps a 5 on considering.

Wait, did I score all correctly? Let me check again.

For ad_attitude_scores:
1. Like: 3
2. Interesting:4
3. Good:3
4. Attractive:4

Purchase intention:
1. Intend:3
2. Try:4
3.Consider:5

Yes, that seems consistent.
