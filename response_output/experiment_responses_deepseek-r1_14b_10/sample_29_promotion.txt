Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down their demographic and personality traits first.

They're from China, male, under 20, with a bachelor's degree. That means they're relatively young but have some education. Their occupation is blue-collar, which might mean they're looking for affordable yet effective products. They're divorced, so maybe family isn't the main focus, and their income is between 16 to 25 million VND per month. That's a decent income, so they can afford pricier items but might be value-conscious.

Looking at their personality traits:
- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Agree – so this person values privacy and may not seek social interaction much.
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree – not someone who's looking to help others, more self-focused.
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree – skeptical of ads and brands.
- Careless: Strongly Agree – might not pay attention to details or could be impulsive.
- Plans and follows through: Strongly Agree – goal-oriented, so maybe prefers products that align with clear benefits.
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Agree – less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals.
- Original/imaginative: Strongly Agree – values creativity and unique ideas.
- Artistic Interests: Strongly Agree – likes things that are creative or have a unique design.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance. Let me think about each aspect.

Attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad.
   - Since the person is reserved and doesn't find others helpful, maybe they don't connect with ads that emphasize social aspects. But the drink is about looking good, which might appeal to someone who values their personal image but is self-focused. However, their skepticism towards trusting ads could make them not like it much.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad is promoting energy and looking good, which are broad themes. The person is creative and imaginative, so an ad that's unique or presents a new idea might catch their interest. But if the ad feels generic, they might not find it interesting.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Being skeptical (strongly disagree on trusting), the person might doubt the ad's claims. They might think it's too good to be true or just another marketing ploy. So belief in the ad would be low.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The drink sounds appealing if it's positioned as something unique and beneficial, especially for someone who values looking their best. But if the ad is overhyped or not creative enough, they might not find it attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - If they're convinced by the benefits and trust the brand a little (though skepticism), maybe they could have intent. But given their distrust, they might hold off unless there's proof.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it might be low because of the cost and the need for the product to align with their goals. They might prefer to see others using it before trying.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is possible if the ad makes them aware, but without a strong belief in the product, consideration might not go far.

Putting it all together: Their skepticism and reserved nature make them less likely to like or believe the ad. However, their interest in looking good and being original might make some aspects appealing. Purchase intent is probably low because of distrust and maybe impulsive tendencies but considering they're careful with plans, perhaps moderate consideration.
