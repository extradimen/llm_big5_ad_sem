Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best. Given my personality, I'm somewhat reserved (strongly disagree) but outgoing (agree). However, the ad's message doesn't resonate much with me because while being energized is good, looking my best isn't a strong motivator. So, I only like it a 3.

Interesting? Not really, since the benefits are pretty generic. People might not find it very engaging beyond that, so another 3.

Is the ad good? It's functional but lacks depth or emotional appeal for me, so a 4 seems fair.

Attractive? The visuals and messaging could be better tailored to my needs, so maybe a 5 on this one, but still not high.

For purchase intention: Do I intend to buy it? Probably not, since there are too many options out there and no strong reason to pick this. So a 3.

Will I try it? Maybe once or twice if someone offers me a sample, but not actively seeking it. Another 3.

Consider buying? It's on the edge; without more compelling reasons, maybe a 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't hit the right notes with my personality and needs.
