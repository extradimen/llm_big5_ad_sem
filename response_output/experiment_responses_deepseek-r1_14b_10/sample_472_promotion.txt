Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: The individual is a single male from China in his 20s-30s with a bachelor's degree, working as a managerial employee, earning between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's reserved but helpful and unselfish, tends to be sometimes rude, isn't very thorough, makes plans but can be careless, gets nervous easily, lacks emotional stability, has an active imagination, and is original but not very artistically inclined.

The ad claims the drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day. Now, considering his personality traits:

1. **Reserved**: He might not be outwardly enthusiastic about products that emphasize social or outgoing benefits.
2. **Helpful and unselfish**: Products that highlight personal benefits (like looking good) might not align with his more introverted and community-focused nature.
3. **Sometimes rude**: Maybe the ad doesn't address any negative traits, so it's neutral.
4. **Careless**: The ad's message is a bit generic; he might find it unimpressive.
5. **Gets nervous easily and emotionally unstable**: Perhaps the energetic aspect isn't appealing if he's looking to calm down.

For the ad's attitude:
- **Like (1)**: He might not connect with it, so low score.
- **Interesting (2)**: The message is standard, so neutral.
- **Good (3)**: It's functional but doesn't wow him, so middle score.
- **Attractive (4)**: Doesn't stand out to him, so low.

Purchase intention:
- **Intend (5)**: Not a strong motivator for him, so low.
- **Try (6)**: Maybe if it's convenient, but not sure.
- **Consider (7)**: He might think about it if others recommend, but not his first choice.

Putting it all together, he'd likely give low scores to the ad and moderate scores to considering purchase.
