Alright, let's break down how I would approach evaluating this advertisement as a 40-49-year-old Chinese male with my specific background and personality traits.

First, looking at the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key selling points here are energy and appearance. Given that I'm in my forties and have a busy job as a civil servant, staying energized could be appealing. However, my personality might influence how much I resonate with this message.

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** – Considering my age and occupation, health and wellness are important but not always the first priority. The ad is straightforward, which is good, but maybe a bit too generic. I don't have strong feelings either way. So, a 3 seems fair.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – The message is clear but might lack depth. It doesn’t particularly stand out or capture my interest beyond the basic promise. A 4 seems appropriate.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** – For an ad to be effective, it needs to build trust. While the claims are positive, I'm not sure if they're backed by enough evidence. My tendency towards skepticism (from agreeing that I’m sometimes rude and generally disagreeing on trusting) makes me less likely to fully believe without more info. A 5 might be too high; maybe a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** – The visual aspects of the ad matter, but since it's just text here, I'm focusing on the messaging. It’s functional but not particularly engaging or visually appealing described this way. So, a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – My cautious nature and tendency towards thoroughness (strongly agreeing with doing a thorough job) makes me want more information before buying. Without knowing the brand's credibility or detailed benefits, I'm not committed. A 2 seems right.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** – Trying is a lower commitment. Given my generally neutral stance towards trusting and cautious nature, I might be open to trying if prompted elsewhere, but not from just this ad. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** – Considering indicates interest but no immediate action. The ad provides some incentive (energy and appearance), which is relevant to my age group, so I would at least think about it when considering options. A 4 feels fitting here.

In summary, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me due to its generic nature and lack of detailed evidence, affecting both my attitude towards it and my willingness to purchase without further information.
