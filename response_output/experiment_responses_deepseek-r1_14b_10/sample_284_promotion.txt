Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my profile. I'm a Chinese male in my 20s, have a postgraduate degree, work as a civil servant, am divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are: Disagree on being talkative, Strongly Agree on outgoing and reserved, Agree on helpfulness, Neutral on trusting, Strongly Agree on sometimes rude, Disagree on thorough job, Strongly Disagree on making plans and following through, Neutral on being careless, Neutral on getting nervous, Strongly Agree on worrying a lot, Strongly Disagree on emotional stability, Strongly Disagree on active imagination, Disagree on originality, and Strongly Disagree on artistic interests.

So, thinking about the ad. The key points are staying energized and looking your best daily. Given my job as a civil servant, being energetic could be important to perform well at work. Also, looking good might matter for social interactions or appearances at work.

My personality traits: I'm outgoing but reserved. That's conflictingâ€”so maybe the ad doesn't directly appeal to me because I'm both? But I am helpful and unselfish, so perhaps the idea of helping others by looking good could resonate a bit. However, I sometimes worry a lot and find it hard to make plans, which might affect my purchase intention.

I tend to be careless neutrally, but since I get nervous easily, maybe ads that stress benefits can be persuasive if they align with my needs. But I'm not sure if this ad speaks to me enough.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Like: The message is positive, but I'm not sure it's tailored to me as a reserved person. Maybe 3.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, so maybe 4.
3. Good: It has clear benefits, perhaps 5.
4. Attractive: Visually, if the ad is appealing, but since the message doesn't strongly connect with my personality, maybe 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Not sure, maybe 3.
2. Try: Maybe I'd be open to trying it once, so 3.
3. Consider: It's something I might think about if others recommend it, so 4.
