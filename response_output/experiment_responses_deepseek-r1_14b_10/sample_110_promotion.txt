Alright, let's break this down. I need to evaluate how a person with the given demographic and personality traits would respond to the ad for the drink that helps stay energized and look best every day.

First, looking at the person: they're a 50-59-year-old Chinese male, a civil servant with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning around 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's talkative and outgoing but also reserved. He strongly disagrees with being helpful or unselfish, which might indicate a more self-centered approach. However, he is trusting, so that could influence his belief in the ad's claims.

The ad's message focuses on energy and looking good daily. For someone in their 50s, maintaining energy levels and appearance might be relevant, especially if they're active or in a demanding job like being a civil servant. The high income suggests he might not be price-sensitive, so the product could appeal to him if it aligns with his lifestyle.

Looking at personality traits: he's talkative and outgoing, which means social interactions are important to him. If the ad makes him feel that using the drink can help maintain his image and energy for socializing, it might resonate. However, being reserved could mean he's more cautious about new products or trends, especially if they seem too flashy.

He's trusting but tends to worry a lot. The ad needs to be credible without causing anxiety. If the product is presented as scientifically backed or recommended by others, that trust factor would help. But since he worries a lot, any perceived risks or lack of clear evidence might make him hesitant.

His tendency to be careless and sometimes make plans but not follow through could affect his purchase intention. He might be interested initially but may not follow up unless the ad strongly motivates him with tangible benefits.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: he's talkative and outgoing, so ads that resonate socially might appeal to him. The message about looking good every day aligns with maintaining a professional image, which is crucial for a civil servant. However, his reserved nature might make him skeptical unless the ad provides concrete evidence or testimonials.

For purchase intention: while the benefits are appealing, he's cautious and worried. He might consider it but need more information before making a decision. The high income suggests he can afford it, but without strong trust in the product, he might not intend to buy immediately.

Overall, the ad touches on points that could be relevant, but his cautious and reserved nature along with his tendency to worry might make him less likely to purchase right away unless the ad builds credibility effectively.
