Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how someone with my specific demographic and personality traits would evaluate this advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target audience is clearly people who want both energy and an improved appearance. Given that I'm a 60+ year old man from China with a high school education, currently a student and divorced, earning between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND per month.

Personality-wise, I'm reserved, helpful, trusting, not rude, neither careless nor nervous easily. Wait, no—actually, looking back, I said I get nervous easily but disagree on being talkative and outgoing, so maybe that's conflicting? Hmm, let me check. Oh, right: reserved (strongly agree), generally trusting (strongly agree), sometimes rude (disagree), make plans and follow through (strongly agree), tend to be careless (strongly disagree). Also, I get nervous easily (strongly agree) but worry a lot is neutral.

So, considering all that, the ad's message is about energy and looking good. Energy might be important for someone who's active or has a busy schedule, especially if they're a student. But looking your best every day—does that resonate with me?

I'm reserved and not very outgoing, so maybe I don't care as much about looking my best in social settings. However, being helpful and trusting, I might value products that genuinely help, like something that provides energy without side effects.

The drink is presented as a solution to staying energized and improving appearance. But how does this align with my traits? Since I'm reserved, maybe the social aspect of looking good isn't as important to me. Also, being someone who makes plans and follows through (strongly agree), perhaps I appreciate products that help maintain routine or energy levels needed for studies.

But then again, I worry a lot (neutral) and get nervous easily (strongly agree). Maybe this drink could help with that? Or maybe not. The ad doesn't specify how it helps beyond just looking good and staying energized.

I'm also original and have an active imagination (strongly agree), so the ad's message might need to be more creative or specific to resonate with me. If it's too generic, I might not find it interesting.

Now, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: Hmm. The message is positive but maybe a bit too broad. Since I'm reserved and don't focus much on social image, I might not feel strongly about it. So probably around 3 or 4.

2. Interesting: If the ad doesn't target my specific needs, it's not interesting. Maybe a 3.

3. Good: It's trying to be positive but lacks depth. Maybe a 4.

4. Attractive: The visuals and message might attract me if they're appealing, but without knowing the specifics, I'm neutral. Perhaps a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Not sure yet; maybe 3.

2. Try to buy: If it's recommended or has good reviews, perhaps higher, but on its own, maybe 3.

3. Consider buying: It's something that could be useful, so maybe a 4.
