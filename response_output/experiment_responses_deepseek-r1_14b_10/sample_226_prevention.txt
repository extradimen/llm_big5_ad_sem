Alright, let me break this down. I'm a civil servant in China, living with my parents, and I make around 26-35 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so maybe I can afford better products. My education is postgraduate, which might mean I'm more discerning about what I buy.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target seems to be people who want to stay alert and presentable. Since I work in a field where appearances matter, maybe this appeals to me. But wait, I'm reserved (strongly agree) and sometimes find ads manipulative. This ad feels a bit pushy by implying that without the drink, you'll look bad.

I tend to worry a lot (strongly agree), so messages about tiredness and dullness might resonate with my anxiety. However, I also get nervous easily and am not trusting of ads. The ad's claim is vague; it doesn't provide evidence or specifics on how the drink helps. Plus, I'm talkative? No, I disagree, so maybe I'm more introspective. 

The personality traits show I'm careful with my job (thorough), but careless in general. So, I might not be someone who meticulously plans to buy such products often. Also, I worry a lot, which makes me cautious about health-related claims without proof.

I have an active imagination and like original ideas, but the ad isn't creative. It's just a straightforward warning. That doesn't engage my interest much. 

So, for attitude toward the ad: I don't dislike it outright (maybe 3), but not interested either (2). I don't think it's good because it's manipulative and lacks proof (1). And not attractive at all (1).

Purchase intention: The message makes me consider my tiredness, so maybe a 3. But the ad doesn't make me want to try it, so that's 2. Considering buying? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet, so another 3.

Overall, the scores would reflect some mild consideration but skepticism.
