Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman aged 40-49 with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker and currently divorced. My monthly income is between 16 million to 25 million VND.

First, looking at the ad's message: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target people who are concerned about their energy levels and appearance. Since I'm in my 40s, maybe I can relate to feeling tired, especially with work and family responsibilities. But does this ad really connect with me?

Personality-wise, I'm helpful and agreeable but tend to worry a lot. My imagination is active, and I like new ideas. However, I find it hard to be talkative and sometimes make plans but not always follow through. Also, I don't get nervous easily but do worry a lot.

Considering the ad's message about tiredness and looking dull—does this resonate? Maybe, because feeling tired can affect how one looks. But is this drink something I would consider buying? My income is on the lower side for that range, so price might be a concern. Plus, blue-collar workers like me might not prioritize such products unless they see immediate benefits.

I'm also cautious about ads making me feel guilty without offering real solutions. The ad seems to play on fear of looking bad and feeling tired. But it doesn't offer any specific benefits beyond the product. Maybe I need more convincing about how this drink actually helps.

On a scale from 1 to 7, how would I score the ad's attitude? It's not particularly interesting or good—it feels generic. I don't find it very attractive either. As for purchase intention, I might consider it if I felt strongly, but with my cautious nature and budget constraints, I'm not sure.
