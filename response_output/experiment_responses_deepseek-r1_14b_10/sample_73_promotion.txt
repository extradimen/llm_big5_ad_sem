Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're a Chinese female student in her late teens or early twenties, single, with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. That's about $1,500 to $2,000 USD, which is decent but not extremely high.

Personality traits: They're reserved (strongly agree), talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing (agree). So they're somewhat social but prefer smaller groups or more intimate settings rather than large gatherings. Reserved might mean they value their alone time and aren't the life of the party, but they can still interact with others when necessary.

They are neutral about being helpful and unselfish. Maybe they balance between being considerate and looking out for themselves, not overly selfless nor selfish.

Generally trusting: disagree. So they might be cautious or skeptical towards ads or claims made by brands.

Sometimes rude: neutral. Could mean they don't have a strong tendency either way, but might be more reserved in communication.

Thorough job: strongly disagree. They probably prefer efficiency over thoroughness and may not see the need to go into great detail unless necessary.

Making plans and following through: disagree. So they might not be very organized or forgetful, perhaps impulsive at times.

Careless: strongly disagree. Wait, that's contradictory because earlier traits suggested being reserved but not necessarily careless. Maybe they are more meticulous in certain areas but not others?

Get nervous easily: strongly agree. High anxiety could affect their decision-making and how they respond to ads.

Worry a lot: agree. So they might overthink things, which ties into the previous point about getting nervous easily.

Emotionally stable: neutral. They have ups and downs but overall can manage their emotions.

Active imagination: agree. Creative thinking, maybe enjoy daydreaming or coming up with ideas.

Original and new ideas: agree. So innovation is important to them, they like fresh concepts.

Artistic interests: neutral. They might not be deeply involved in arts but could appreciate it in some form.

Now, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points are energy boost and appearance improvement.

Looking at their personality:

- Being reserved and somewhat introverted, they might not be swayed by social image as much as extroverts. However, looking good is a universal desire.
- They're cautious about trusting ads (disagree on trust), so the claims need to be believable.
- High anxiety and tendency to worry could make them skeptical of health-related products unless there's clear evidence or recommendations.
- Their active imagination and originality might find the ad creative, but they also need practical benefits.

For attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: They might not strongly like it because the claims are too broad without specifics. A neutral to slightly disagree stance (maybe a 3 or 4 on the scale).
2. Interesting: The idea of looking good and energized is appealing, but without details, it's just another ad. Maybe around 4.
3. Good: Since they're cautious, unless the ad resonates deeply, it might not be seen as good. Perhaps a 4 or 5 if there are positive aspects.
4. Attractive: The imagery and message could attract them if well-designed, but without more info, maybe 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: High skepticism (disagree on trust) makes it less likely. Maybe around 3.
2. Try to buy: Slightly higher than intent because the idea is appealing. Perhaps a 4.
3. Consider buying: Might think about it but need more info, so maybe 5.

So putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: [3,4,4,5]
Purchase intention: [3,4,5]

I'm not entirely sure about some of the points. For example, their agree on having an active imagination and being original might make them appreciate a creative ad more, pushing up the 'interesting' score higher, maybe to 5. Similarly, if the ad's imagery is strong, 'attractive' could be 6.

But considering their cautious nature towards trust, I think 4s are safer for 'good' and 'attractive'. So finalizing:

Ad attitude: [3,4,4,5]
Purchase intention: [3,4,5]

I might have gone a bit too high on some scores, but it's a balance between their personality traits and the ad's message.
