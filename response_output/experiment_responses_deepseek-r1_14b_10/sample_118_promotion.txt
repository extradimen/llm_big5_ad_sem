Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given that I'm a student in my 20s, staying energized is relatable. However, "look your best" feels a bit generic, so maybe 3.
   
2. **Interesting**: The benefits are clear, but it doesn't offer anything unique or emotional hook. So, a 4 seems right.

3. **Good**: It's informative but lacks depth and creativity. A 5 is fair.

4. **Attractive**: The visuals might be appealing, but the message isn't compelling enough for me. So, a 6 feels accurate.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: I don't feel strongly motivated by the ad's claims. A 3.
   
2. **Try to buy**: No strong reason to try it over others, so another 3.
   
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar, but not a priority yet. A 4 makes sense.

Overall, the ad doesn't connect deeply with my personality or needs enough to drive purchase intent, though it's somewhat positive.
