**Ad Analysis:**
The advertisement states, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Demographic Fit:** The person is over 60, so the ad's focus on energy levels and appearance might resonate if she's concerned about these aspects post-retirement or due to aging.
2. **Personality Traits:** She is thorough but not very outgoing. She worries a lot, which makes her more susceptible to ads that address potential problems (like tiredness). However, being reserved and not talkative may make her less influenced by social aspects of the ad.
3. **Perceived Credibility:** The phrasing is direct and claims a negative outcome without the product, which could be persuasive if she's health-conscious.

**Attitude Toward Ad:**
1. **Like (Score 2):** She might not find it overly likable but could see its relevance.
2. **Interesting (Score 3):** The message is clear but perhaps not engaging enough for her reserved nature.
3. **Good (Score 4):** It effectively communicates a problem and solution, making it seem good in terms of messaging.
4. **Attractive (Score 3):** The ad's directness might not be appealing to her if she prefers subtler marketing.

**Purchase Intention:**
1. **Intend to Purchase (Score 2):** While the message is clear, her reserved nature and possibly cautious spending habits may prevent a strong intent.
2. **Try to Buy (Score 3):** She might consider it due to the problem-solution approach but isn't immediately convinced.
3. **Consider Buying (Score 5):** The ad addresses a real concern, leading her to think about it as a potential solution.

The scores reflect a cautious consideration rather than enthusiastic approval or immediate action. Her thorough nature makes her evaluate the product's benefits, but her reserved and less outgoing personality doesn't drive her to act impulsively.
