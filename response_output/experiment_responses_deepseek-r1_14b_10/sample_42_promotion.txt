Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: They're from China, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree, are a managerial employee, live with parents, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. Personality traits include being reserved, helpful, not trusting, sometimes rude (disagree), thorough job (neutral), plans but doesn't follow through (disagree), not careless, not nervous, worries little, emotionally stable, original with ideas, few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

I need to think about how each of these traits affects their response. Let's start with attitude toward the advertisement.

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is reserved (agree) which might mean they don't get emotionally excited easily. They're helpful, so maybe they appreciate positive messages. But they strongly disagree with being trusting, so they might be skeptical of the ad's claims. Considering their age and background, perhaps they find it okay but not overly appealing.
   
2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad targets energy and appearance. Since they're over 60, staying energized could be relevant. But if they are reserved and not easily impressed, maybe they don't find it very interesting.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - They might not trust the ad's claims (strongly disagree), so their belief in the ad being good would be low.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on if it resonates with them. If they're more practical and reserved, maybe they don't find it very attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - They are thorough but disagree with making plans. They worry little (disagree) so might not be in a rush. Their high income could mean they can afford such products, but if they're skeptical of the ad's claims, their intent would be low.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying requires interest and belief. Since they are not very trusting or interested, trying it might not be on their list.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering could happen if there's a need, but given their skepticism and reserved nature, maybe they wouldn't even think about it much.

So putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: 2 (like), 2 (interesting), 1 (good), 2 (attractive)
Purchase intentions: 2 (intend), 2 (try), 3 (consider) - but wait, the scale is 1-7. If they are neutral on consideration, maybe it's around 3.

But let me think again. The person has a strong imagination and originality but few artistic interests. So the ad might not appeal to their imaginative side as much since it's straightforward. They're stable emotionally, so not easily swayed by emotional appeals.

They make thorough jobs (neutral), so maybe they don't have a strong opinion on the quality of the ad. But their income is high, so perhaps the price isn't an issue. However, their distrust in the ad's claims might lower their belief.

So, maybe:

Ad attitude: 3,3,2,3? Or lower?

Wait, considering they are emotionally stable and not easily moved, perhaps their like for the ad is around 3 (neutral). Interesting could be 3 as well. Belief would be lower since they don't trust ads much, so maybe 2. Attractive might also be neutral.

Purchase intent: They might consider it if it's presented well, but given their skepticism, they might not intend to buy unless convinced. So 'intend' is low, 'try' also low, and 'consider' maybe a 3 or 4.

Alternatively, considering they are original and have good ideas, maybe the ad could catch their interest slightly more. But overall, I think the scores would be on the lower side.
