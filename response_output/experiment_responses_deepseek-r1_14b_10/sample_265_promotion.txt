Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key benefits here are energy and appearance. 

Given my demographic profile, I'm over 60, from China, have a postgraduate degree, am divorced, and earn between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being somewhat disagreeable in terms of talkativeness and sociability, reserved, not very helpful or unselfish, but generally trusting. I don't get nervous easily, which is contradictory because one trait says agree on getting nervous, another strongly disagrees on worrying a lot. Wait, noâ€”the worry a lot is a strongly disagree, so maybe I'm more stable than others. 

I have an active imagination and am original with new ideas, but have few artistic interests. So I'm creative but not very into arts.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **Like the ad**: The message is positive about health and appearance. But considering my age, I might be more focused on health than looking younger. However, being over 60, staying energized could still resonate. But the part about "look your best" might not be as important to me as it is to younger people. So maybe neutral.

2. **Interesting**: The ad makes a claim about both energy and appearance, which are broad benefits. I'm somewhat agreeable on trusting, so maybe interesting? Maybe 3.

3. **Believe the ad**: Trust is a factor here. Since I tend to agree that I'm generally trusting, but the ad seems too general. It might not provide specific evidence or details. So perhaps neutral, around 4.

4. **Attractive**: The ad is positive and uses attractive language, but without seeing visuals or knowing the brand, it's hard to say. Maybe 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy**: I'm more practical. The ad doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence for someone in my demographic. Plus, I tend to be original but not sure if this drink fits that. So probably neutral.

2. **Try to buy**: Without strong reasons, I wouldn't rush to try it. Maybe 3.

3. **Consider buying**: It's something to think about, especially if the product is known. But since I'm critical and don't get easily swayed by ads alone, maybe a low 3.

So scores would be around 3-4 for attitude and similar or lower for purchase intention.
