Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:
1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive attributes. However, the way it's phrased feels a bit generic and not tailored to my specific needs. Plus, the "look your best" part might focus more on appearance rather than overall well-being. Given that I'm reserved and value thoroughness, the ad doesn't resonate strongly with me. So, I give it a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but lacks depth or any unique angle. It doesn't stand out enough to capture my interest. Considering my personality traits, which include being somewhat reserved and not easily swayed by superficial claims, this gets a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the intention of the ad is positive, it's too vague. There's no specific evidence or benefits detailed, which makes it hard for me to fully trust its claims. My tendency towards being thorough and analytical means I need more concrete information. Thus, a 4 seems appropriate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual aspects of an ad can vary, but based solely on the text provided, it doesn't offer anything particularly eye-catching or innovative. Since I'm not easily drawn to generic claims, this scores a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My cautious and analytical nature makes me skeptical of such broad health claims without evidence. Without specific benefits or proof, there's no strong reason for me to plan a purchase. Hence, a 2.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Even though the ad mentions staying energized and looking good, I'm more inclined to try products that offer specific solutions or have proven results. Since this ad doesn't provide enough detail, my willingness to try it is low, scoring a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While not convinced by the ad alone, I might think about it if there's availability and price isn't an issue. However, given that other products might offer more tangible benefits, consideration isn't very high. A 4 seems fair here.
