Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that claims to help you stay energized and look your best every day. The goal is to score my attitude toward the ad and my purchase intention based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, let me break down my background. I’m from China, female, over 60 years old, with a postgraduate degree, divorced, and earn more than 46 million VND monthly. My income is quite high, which might mean I can afford premium products but also might be cautious about spending.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Generally trusting: Neutral
- Sometimes rude to others: Agree
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Neutral
- Careless: Disagree
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, come up with new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Artistic interests: Neutral

So, I'm outgoing but not talkative. I'm not helpful or unselfish, which might affect how I perceive ads that rely on trust or community. I don't make a thorough job and sometimes get nervous easily.

Now, the ad's message is about staying energized and looking good daily. Since I’m over 60, my priorities might be health and appearance to maintain vitality despite aging. The drink could appeal to me if it’s positioned as effective for energy and beauty.

But considering my personality: I'm not very trusting (Neutral), sometimes rude (Agree), which might make me skeptical of ads that seem too pushy or not credible. Also, I get nervous easily (Strongly Agree) so an ad that feels overwhelming or high-pressure might turn me off.

The ad is a promotion type. Let's score each part:

Ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: The message seems positive but I'm not sure if it resonates with me personally. Maybe 4.
2. Interesting: It’s a common claim, but since I value looking good and energy, maybe 5.
3. Good: It might be effective in its messaging, but my skepticism is a bit of a downer. Perhaps 4.
4. Attractive: Visuals could matter, but without knowing specifics, I'll say 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: High price might make me think twice. Maybe 3.
2. Try the product: If it's recommended or has good reviews, maybe 4.
3. Consider buying: It’s an option if I see benefits, so 5.

I need to adjust these based on my traits. Since I'm not very trusting and get nervous easily, ads that feel too pushy might lower my scores. Also, being over 60, the ad should cater to health and beauty aspects, which it does, but without specific evidence or a compelling offer, my interest is moderate.

So finalizing:
Ad态度: Like (4), Interesting(5), Good(4), Attractive(5)
Purchase intention: Intend(3), Try(4), Consider(5)
