Alright, let me try to figure out how I would score this advertisement based on my given profile and personality traits. 

First, I need to understand the ad itself: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention-oriented message, suggesting that not using the product could lead to negative outcomes like feeling tired or looking dull.

Now, considering my demographic background: I'm a male under 20 from China with a postgraduate degree and work as a managerial employee. My income is between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly, which is quite high. I live with my parents, so maybe family influence plays a role.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Agree
- Rude: Disagree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Make plans and follow through: Agree
- Careless: Neutral
- Nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Artistic interests: Agree

So, I'm someone who is talkative and has an active imagination but tends to get nervous easily. I'm not very helpful or unselfish, which might affect how I perceive the ad's message.

The ad focuses on negative outcomes if you don't use the drink—feeling tired and looking dull. Since I tend to get nervous and worry a lot (though I strongly disagree with worrying a lot), but I do get nervous easily. This could make me more responsive to ads that prevent negative feelings, like feeling tired or appearing dull.

I'm also someone who makes plans and follows through, which might mean I value products that help me maintain energy levels so I can stick to my plans. Plus, as a managerial employee, looking presentable is probably important for work.

However, I disagree with being helpful and unselfish, so maybe the ad's message doesn't strongly appeal to altruistic values. But since it's about personal presentation and energy, which are self-oriented, that might align better with my personality.

I have a strong imagination, which could make the ad more vivid for me, but I'm not sure if that translates directly into liking the ad or considering purchase. Also, being talkative and outgoing (neutral) might mean social image is somewhat important to me, so looking dull could be a concern.

On the other hand, my income is quite high, which suggests I can afford premium products, but I'm living with parents, so maybe family dynamics influence purchasing decisions.

So for ad attitude:

1. Like: The message is clear and relevant, so probably agree.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme, but with an active imagination, maybe it stands out—neutral to slightly positive.
3. Good: If I find it relevant, then agree.
4. Attractive: If the visuals and message are appealing.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend: The ad addresses specific concerns, so might intend if I feel convinced.
2. Try: Might be more cautious unless convinced.
3. Consider: Likely to consider after seeing the ad.

I think my scores would reflect that the ad is somewhat positive but not overly persuasive for me yet. Maybe 4/7 on some aspects and lower on others.

Wait, let's break it down:

Ad attitude:
1. Like - Neutral (4)
2. Interesting - Slightly Agree (5)
3. Good - Neutral to slightly agree (4-5)
4. Attractive - Neutral (4)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend - Disagree (3)
2. Try - Neutral (4)
3. Consider - Neutral (4)

But maybe I'm being too cautious. Since the ad targets negative outcomes, and I get nervous easily, perhaps it's more impactful. So maybe higher scores on attitude.

Alternatively, since I don't see a strong emotional appeal beyond basic prevention, maybe lower scores.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think my final scores would be:

Ad态度: 4,5,4,5
购买意图: 3,4,4

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the ad isn't very compelling for me personally.
