Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at my scores for the ad evaluation.

Starting with the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, evaluating my attitude towards the ad. I'm a 60+ year old civil servant from China, single, with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 36-45 million VND. My personality traits include being helpful, strongly disagreeing with being reserved, generally trusting is something I don't feel strongly about, worry a lot but am emotionally stable.

1. **I like the ad.** The message focuses on energy and appearance, which might appeal to someone looking to maintain vitality, but as an older adult, maybe more concerned with health than looks. However, the benefits are positive, so it's not dislikeable, but I don't feel a strong personal connection. So a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of a drink that does two things—staying energized and looking good—is intriguing. It targets multiple needs efficiently. But since I'm not particularly focused on aesthetics as much as health, it's somewhat interesting but not compelling. A 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The ad makes positive claims about the drink's benefits, which are appealing. However, without specific evidence or details, my trust is neutral. Given that I'm generally trusting but also cautious, a middle score of 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The concept is attractive because everyone wants to feel energized and look good. But as an older individual, perhaps more concerned with health benefits than looking younger. So it's somewhat attractive but not overwhelmingly so. A 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm cautious about new products unless they're recommended or have proven benefits. Since the ad doesn't provide specific evidence, my intent is low. Maybe a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong reasons or recommendations, trying it might be too much of a stretch. So, neutral leaning towards no—maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering is better because the benefits are positive, but I'm not sure if they're relevant enough for me. A 4 seems reasonable as I might think about it if more info comes up.
