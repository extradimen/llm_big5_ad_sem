Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking best. While helpfulness is important to me, the idea of looking my best isn't a strong motivator since I'm reserved and don't focus much on appearance. So, maybe a 3.
2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but not particularly intriguing. It doesn't tap into my imagination or originality, so around 4.
3. **Good**: As someone who values thoroughness and trust, the ad feels okay but lacks specific details. A 5 seems fair.
4. **Attractive**: I'm more reserved and don't find such ads visually compelling. So, a 3.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: My tendency towards carelessness might make me less likely to seek this product out proactively. A 4.
2. **Try to buy**: Since the ad doesn't resonate deeply, I'm not motivated to try it. Still a 4.
3. **Consider buying**: Maybe if reminded in-store, but it's low on my priority list. So, a 5.

Overall, the scores reflect that while I find some aspects of the ad okay, they don't strongly influence me towards purchase.
