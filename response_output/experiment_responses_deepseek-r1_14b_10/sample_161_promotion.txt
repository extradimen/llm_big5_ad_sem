Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

Starting with the ad's attitude:
1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**  
   The ad is straightforward but doesn't really connect with me on a personal level. It seems generic and not tailored to my specific needs or lifestyle as someone in my demographic.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**  
   While it's clear about its benefits, I don't find it particularly engaging or unique. There's nothing that stands out to make me pay attention beyond the basic message.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**  
   It effectively communicates the product's key selling points, but without any emotional appeal or personal connection, I'm not fully convinced it's the best option for me.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**  
   The visuals and message are clean, which is good. However, without more compelling reasons, it doesn't attract me strongly enough to change my mind about trying something new.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   The ad makes me aware of the product, but I'm not convinced it's necessary or better than what I already use. More info would be needed.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   If I saw it in a store and remembered the ad, I might pick it up. It's not a strong enough motivator on its own, though.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The benefits mentioned are appealing, so I would think about trying it, especially if it's recommended by others or offers some added value.
