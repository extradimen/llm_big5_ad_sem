Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score their evaluation of the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ad itself: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting someone who might be concerned about looking tired or not feeling up to par. The message is about prevention—avoiding those negative feelings by using the product.

Now, considering her background: she's a single, educated office worker over 60 with a high income in China. She’s talkative but sometimes careless and rude, trusting yet emotionally stable. Her personality traits might influence how she perceives such an ad.

Starting with her attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** – The message is clear and uses fear to drive action. However, being over 60, maybe she's more cautious about health products. But since she’s outgoing and talkative, she might find the message compelling enough to like it. Maybe a 5? Not super high but not negative.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, especially for someone active in their career. It’s straightforward and uses emotional triggers. A 6 seems reasonable since she might find it engaging enough to consider.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** – For her to believe it, it needs credibility. The fear appeal is strong but may not be convincing enough. Considering she's trusting but also tends to worry a lot, maybe a 5? She might feel it's okay but not entirely trustworthy.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** – Visually and conceptually, if the ad is well-crafted, it could attract her. The message is direct. A 6 here as she might find it appealing despite any doubts.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – High income suggests she can afford it, but she's also careless and sometimes rude. Maybe she doesn't see the immediate need or prefers other methods to stay alert. So a 5? Not strong intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** – She might be curious but not sure if it's necessary. Testing it once could be a consideration, so maybe a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** – Given her high income and concern about appearance, she's likely open to considering it as part of her routine. A solid 6 here.

Putting it all together, the scores should reflect her mixed feelings but some level of consideration.
