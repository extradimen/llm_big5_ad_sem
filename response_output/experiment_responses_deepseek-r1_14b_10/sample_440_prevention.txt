Alright, so I need to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let's break down my profile: I'm a male from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee, divorced, earning between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm not talkative (strongly disagree), outgoing and sociable (agree), reserved (agree), unhelpful and selfish (strongly disagree), neutral on trust, sometimes rude (agree), do thorough jobs (disagree), don't make good plans (disagree), careful (disagree), not nervous (strongly disagree), worry a bit (neutral), emotionally stable (strongly agree), not very imaginative (disagree), original and creative (agree), have many artistic interests (strongly disagree).

The ad is targeting someone who might feel tired and look dull without the drink. Since I'm a managerial employee, maybe this drink is aimed at helping me stay alert or energetic during work hours. However, considering my income level is quite high for a postgraduate in China, maybe it's a premium product.

Looking at the ad's message: It's focusing on preventing tiredness and dull looks. This ties into someone's self-image and productivity. As an employee, I might care about looking good and being energetic to make a good impression at work.

Now, considering my personality traits:

- Outgoing but reserved: Maybe the ad appeals because it emphasizes how others perceive me, which is important for someone who's both outgoing and values their privacy.
- Sometimes rude: Perhaps this trait makes me more critical of the ad's approach. If the ad feels manipulative or too pushy, I might not like it.
- Emotionally stable: This could mean I'm less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals in ads but might respond to logical arguments.
- Original and creative: The ad is simple, so maybe that's seen as a positive trait if the product aligns with creativity.

Regarding purchase intention:

- High income suggests I can afford premium products, but I don't make thorough plans (disagree), which might mean I'm not the type to plan purchases meticulously. However, being original and creative, I might be interested in unique products that offer a clear benefit.
- The ad's message is about preventionâ€”feeling tired and looking dull are negatives I want to avoid. If the drink effectively addresses these, it could appeal to me.

On the other hand, since I'm not talkative (strongly disagree) and somewhat reserved, maybe I don't feel the need to project a certain image as much as more outgoing people. Also, being sometimes rude might make me view the ad as too pushy or insincere.

So, for attitude towards the ad:

1. Like: The message is clear but perhaps a bit overbearing given my personality traits. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: It's straightforward and targets specific needs, so maybe 5.
3. Good: Effective in conveying the product's benefit, so perhaps 6.
4. Attractive: Not particularly attractive since it's a simple message without visual appeal, so maybe 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad makes a good point, but I'm not sure if it's enough for me to buy. Maybe a 5.
2. Try to buy: If the product works, I might try it, so perhaps 6.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on my mind after seeing the ad, so maybe 7.

I think I might give higher scores to the purchase intentions because the message directly addresses something I care about (looking good and being energetic), even if I'm not fully sold on the ad's approach.
