Alright, let's break this down. I'm a 27-year-old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker. I live with my parents and earn between 26 to 35 million VND a month. 

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key here is that it's using negative emotions—feeling tired and looking dull—to sell the product. Since I'm an office worker, my job can be quite demanding, so feeling tired is something I relate to.

The ad is trying to appeal to my desire to avoid looking worn out. My personality traits show I'm talkative and outgoing, which means I probably want to maintain a good appearance in social settings. The ad's message aligns with that because it suggests the drink can help me stay energized and look better, which is important for someone who values their social image.

I'm also thorough and make plans, so the idea of using a product to prevent tiredness could fit into my routine. However, I tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily, so maybe I'm more concerned about looking good to handle stress at work.

The ad's message is clear but feels a bit pushy. It makes me think about whether I really need such a drink or if it's just another marketing ploy. My reserved side might make me question the necessity of this product. Plus, my cautious nature means I'd want to see some evidence or reviews before deciding.

I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe I would consider sharing the drink with others, but that doesn't directly affect my purchase intention. The ad's focus on preventing tiredness and looking dull does resonate because it speaks to common concerns in both professional and social settings.

In terms of attitude toward the ad, I find it somewhat interesting because it addresses real issues. It's good because it's straightforward, but not extremely attractive since it doesn't offer anything unique or emotional beyond the problem statement. 

For purchase intention, while I don't have a strong intent to buy right now, I might consider it if there are positive reviews or promotions. Trying it isn't something I'm immediately inclined to do, but considering it is possible.
