Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad: it's promoting a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. 

First, looking at my demographic profile—I'm a male over 60 from China, with a high school education, single, monthly income under 15 million VND, and I'm a student. My personality traits include being outgoing (strongly agree), not talkative (strongly disagree), unreserved (strongly disagree), somewhat helpful but disagreeing on being unselfish, trusting (agree), never rude (strongly disagree), thorough in my work (strongly agree), not good at making plans (strongly disagree), neutral about being careless, and so on.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: Since I'm outgoing, maybe this energetic message resonates. But I'm also reserved, which might make me less interested in something too flashy. I'll think a 5 here—maybe neutral leaning towards agree.

2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone active. I'd say 6—it's interesting enough to catch my attention.

3. Good: The ad's message seems positive and beneficial. I agree it's good, so maybe a 6 here too.

4. Attractive: The ad sounds attractive because of the benefits mentioned. Maybe 5—could be more appealing if there were visuals or specific claims.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: As an older person, health and energy are important. But without seeing proof or knowing the product better, maybe a 4—leaning towards neutral but not sure yet.

2. Try to buy: I'm cautious about new products. Maybe a 5—somewhat willing to try if others recommend it.

3. Consider buying: I would think about it, especially if there's more info. A 6 seems right—I'd give it serious consideration.
