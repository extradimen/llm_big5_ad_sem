Alright, let me break down how I came up with these scores. Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad targets feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable for many. However, being reserved and sometimes rude (from my traits), I don't connect strongly to the message's emotional appeal. So, a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: It uses common concerns but lacks creativity or originality, as per my personality traits where I have few artistic interests. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The message is clear but feels overused and not compelling enough. My thorough job score is low, so I'm skeptical about its effectiveness. Hence, a 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: While it's straightforward, it doesn't stand out or capture my attention much. A 3 fits here.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The ad doesn't address any specific needs I have. My income is low, so I'm cautious about expenses. A 2.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without a strong emotional connection or clear benefits, the desire to try isn't high. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's something to think about, but other factors like cost and necessity weigh in. A 4 feels right.
