Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a 60+ year old man from China with a bachelor's degree, working in an office and currently divorced. My monthly income is between 16 million to 25 million VND. 

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message seems to target people who are concerned about their energy levels and appearance. Since I'm over 60, I might be more interested in staying alert and looking good.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing (Agree), helpful (Strongly Agree), trusting (Strongly Agree), but sometimes rude (Agree). I make plans and follow through (Strongly Agree) and am emotionally stable (Agree). Also, I like to come up with new ideas (Agree).

The ad is trying to create a fear of feeling tired and looking dull without the product. Since I'm an office worker, staying alert is important. But does this ad make me feel the need? It's a bit vague. I might think it's targeting younger professionals more.

I'm not sure if the ad is interesting or good because it doesn't offer specific benefits. It just presents a problem without explaining how the drink solves it. My trust in ads is high, but I also tend to be careful (Strongly Disagree). So, I need clear evidence before believing such claims.

Regarding purchase intention: I don't feel compelled to buy immediately, but considering I might think about it if others recommend it or there's more info.
