Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target demographic is a male over 60 in China, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker, divorced, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. His personality traits are mixed: outgoing, helpful, not trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original with ideas, and few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's message: It focuses on avoiding tiredness and looking dull without the drink. So, it's targeting someone who values energy and appearance. Since he's over 60, maybe fatigue is a concern? But considering his monthly income is pretty high for Vietnam, he might be health-conscious or looking for premium products.

Personality traits: He's outgoing but not talkative. Helpful and unselfish, which could mean he cares about how he presents himself to others. However, he's strongly disagreeing with being trusting, so he might be skeptical of ads. He worries a lot, gets nervous easily, and is emotionally stable—maybe indicating he's cautious in decisions. He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas but doesn't have many artistic interests.

Looking at the ad, it's a prevention message—it's about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Prevention ads often appeal to people who are proactive about their health or appearance. Given his income level, he might be in a position where looking good and feeling energetic is important for work or social interactions.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: He might not strongly agree because he's skeptical (Strongly Disagree on trusting). The message is straightforward but might feel too generic.
2. Interesting: Since he's original and has an active imagination, maybe the ad could be seen as interesting if it's presented in a unique way. But without more info, Neutral seems likely.
3. Good: If the ad is clear and addresses his needs, it could be good, but given his skepticism, probably Neutral.
4. Attractive: If the visuals are appealing and the message resonates, maybe somewhat agreeable, so 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's skeptical, worries a lot, and is cautious, so he might not feel compelled immediately. Maybe Neutral.
2. Try to buy: If he feels convinced by the benefits, he might consider trying it once. So maybe Agree.
3. Consider buying: Given his income, perhaps he would think about it as a possible option.

Wait, but considering his high income, he might be looking for quality products that offer real benefits, so if the ad makes him believe in those benefits, he might have higher intentions. But due to his skepticism and being emotionally stable yet worried, he might need more convincing.
