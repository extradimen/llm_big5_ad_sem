Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I have a neutral to slightly positive view on the ad. It's not particularly attractive or interesting to me personally, given my reserved and unartistic traits, but it doesn't strongly disagree with my values either. The claim about staying energized is something that could be relevant for an office worker, so there's some appeal there despite my general distrust of such claims.
- **Purchase intention:** I am not particularly inclined to purchase the product based on the ad alone. My trust in others and tendency to make plans might lead me to consider it if it fits into a broader health plan or if recommended by someone I trust, but the lack of strong interest from the advertisement means my intention is low.
