Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**:
  - I like the ad (4): Neutral to slightly positive. The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best aligns with my outgoing nature and desire to present myself well, but it doesn't strongly resonate due to my skepticism and cautiousness.
  - I think the ad is interesting (5): More positive as it appeals to my sociable side and the idea of being energized for daily activities.
  - I believe the ad is good (4): Neutral-positive. It seems like a typical promotional claim, which doesn't particularly stand out but isn't off-putting either.
  - I find the ad attractive (3): Slightly negative due to my cautious nature and skepticism about such broad claims without evidence or personal experience.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**:
  - I intend to purchase this product (2): Low intention as there is no strong personal motivation or need for a drink that promises energy enhancement, especially with the lack of trust in advertisements.
  - I will try to buy this product (2): Similarly low, reflecting my carefreeness but also skepticism; it would require more information or social proof to convince me to actively seek out the purchase.
  - I will consider buying this product (3): Somewhat higher as there is a possibility of considering it if further details are provided that align with my values and needs, though not an immediate intent due to my cautious approach.
