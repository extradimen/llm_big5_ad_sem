Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (score 4) and interesting to a moderate extent (score 5), but it doesn't strike me as particularly good or outstanding (score 3). It is attractive in the sense that it promises energy, which could be relevant for an office worker like myself, hence the score of 4.
- **Purchase intention**: I am not strongly inclined to purchase the product immediately (score 2), but if there's a chance encounter or a good deal, I might try it out (score 1). However, I would still consider buying the product based on further information and reviews (score 3).
