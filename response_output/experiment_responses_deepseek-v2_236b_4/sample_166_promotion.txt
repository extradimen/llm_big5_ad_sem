Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a reserved individual with an active imagination and artistic interests (disagreeing that I have few), I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive. However, my cautious nature leads me to be more neutral or mildly positive about its goodness and likeability.
  - Like: 3 (Neutral) - While not strongly drawn to the advertisement, there is some appeal due to my artistic interests.
  - Interesting: 4 (Agree somewhat) - The claim of staying energized aligns with my potential need for a boost during work as a civil servant.
  - Good: 2 (Disagree slightly) - My reserved nature makes me skeptical about the overall quality implied by the ad.
  - Attractive: 5 (Agree moderately) - As someone who appreciates creativity, I find some appeal in how the product is presented.

- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding aspects of the ad attractive and interesting, my practicality and thoroughness in decision-making lead me to a more cautious approach towards purchasing.
  - Intend: 1 (Strongly Disagree) - I'm not convinced enough by the ad to immediately intend to purchase it.
  - Try: 2 (Disagree slightly) - There may be some interest, but my thorough nature requires further investigation before committing to a try.
  - Consider: 3 (Neutral) - While I am open to considering the product, more information and evidence of its claims would be needed for me to move forward with a purchase.
