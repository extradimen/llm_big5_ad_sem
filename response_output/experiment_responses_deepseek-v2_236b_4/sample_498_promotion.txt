Explanation:
- Attitude towards the advertisement: As a reserved individual who is not particularly outgoing or talkative, I find the ad to be somewhat appealing but not overly attractive. It's interesting enough to catch my attention, and it seems good in terms of its message, but it doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my more introverted nature.
- Purchase intention: While the ad is intriguing, my tendency towards nervousness and worry might lead me to be cautious about new products. I would consider buying it if there was enough information to convince me of its benefits, but I am not immediately inclined to purchase or try it without further research. My planning skills are not strong, so even though I find the ad interesting, my intention to act on it is low.
