Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**:
  1. I like the ad (3): Neutral to slightly positive as it's not overly appealing but also not off-putting.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (4): Slightly above neutral due to curiosity about how the drink might help with energy and appearance, even if skepticism remains.
  3. I believe the ad is good (5): A somewhat positive assessment as it's a clear message without any immediate red flags.
  4. I find the ad attractive (2): Below neutral because there isn't a strong appeal to artistic interests or innovation in the advertisement, which aligns with my personality traits of having few artistic interests and being original.
- **Purchase intention**:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (1): Strongly disagree as it doesn't align strongly enough with personal values or needs.
  2. I will try to buy this product (1): Again, a strong disagreement because the ad hasn't established sufficient credibility or appeal for immediate action.
  3. I will consider buying this product (2): A slightly more open stance as there might be some potential in the claims made by the advertisement, but without thorough consideration and likely comparison with other products.
