Explanation:
- As a young civil servant with a reserved personality but also helpful and thorough in my job, I find the ad moderately appealing. It suggests that the drink can help me stay energized and look my best, which aligns with my need to perform well at work (hence scores of 3 for "like", 4 for "interesting", 5 for "good", and 4 for "attractive").
- However, I am also skeptical by nature ("I am generally trusting": Strongly Disagree) and would likely do some research before purchasing a product based on an advertisement alone. Therefore, my purchase intention is moderate but not strong (2 for "intend", 3 for "try", and 4 for "consider").
