Explanation of scores:
- The advertisement is not particularly persuasive to me as an individual with a reserved personality and neutral interest in artistic or new ideas. However, I am helpful and generally unselfish, which might make me consider products that benefit others. Therefore, my attitude towards the ad ranges from neutral (3) to somewhat positive (6).
- My purchase intention is low because although I find the ad attractive, as a person over 60 with a postgraduate degree, I am likely more focused on health and well-being than superficial energy boosts or appearance enhancement. Thus, my scores reflect minimal interest in purchasing the product (1) but some willingness to consider it (3).
