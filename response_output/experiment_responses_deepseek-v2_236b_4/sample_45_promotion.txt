 Based on my demographic profile and personality traits as a virtual person who is Chinese, male, in his late forties, with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant, married, and earning above the specified income, I evaluate the advertisement "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day" as follows:

---

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
