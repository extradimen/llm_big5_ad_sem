Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad's claim about staying energized and looking one's best is a common appeal in many products. As a reserved individual with few artistic interests, I am not strongly attracted to such claims but find them moderately attractive (score 4). However, my tendency towards being thorough and following through with plans makes me skeptical of the ad's promises, which is reflected in lower scores for finding it good or interesting (scores 2 and 2 respectively). My neutral stance on liking the ad indicates a lack of strong positive or negative feelings about it (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: With my occupation as a blue-collar worker and a postgraduate degree, I am likely to be more focused on practical aspects rather than advertised promises. Additionally, my low scores for making plans and following through suggest that while the ad might not appeal strongly to me, it doesn't completely dismiss the possibility of considering or trying the product (scores 1 and 2 respectively). However, my intention to purchase is quite low (score 1), reflecting a cautious approach towards believing in such marketed benefits.
