Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat appealing (like - 4), it's moderately interesting to me (interesting - 5), but I don't fully believe in its goodness (good - 3). However, I do find it visually attractive (attractive - 6), which is a plus.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad has caught my attention and I might look into it further (try - 2), I am not immediately convinced to purchase it (intend - 2). Nevertheless, I will consider buying this product if other factors such as reviews or price align with my expectations (consider - 4).
