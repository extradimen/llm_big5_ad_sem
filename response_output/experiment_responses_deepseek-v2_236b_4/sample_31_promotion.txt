Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I am somewhat skeptical and reserved about the advertisement due to my personality traits. However, as an office worker, the promise of staying energized is mildly appealing (score 3 for "interesting"). The claim of looking one's best aligns with personal care, which can be attractive (score 3 for "attractive"), but overall, I am not particularly drawn to it (scores 2 and 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite the moderate interest in the ad, my intention to purchase is low. My personality suggests that I may be more critical of such claims and less likely to follow through with a plan to buy based on an advertisement alone (score 1 for "intend"). However, if it were recommended by someone I trust or came across as part of a promotion with a trial option, I might consider trying it out (score 1 for "try" and score 2 for "consider").
