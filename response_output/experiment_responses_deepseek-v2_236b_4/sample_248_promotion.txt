Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4) and interesting to me as a civil servant who values being energized for work (score 5). However, I am not strongly convinced that it is good overall (score 3), nor do I find it particularly attractive given my lack of artistic interests (score 2).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While the ad does pique some interest in staying energized, as a practical and somewhat skeptical person, I don't intend to purchase based solely on this advertisement (score 1). However, if there is more information or positive reviews from trusted sources, I might try it out (score 1), and it would definitely be something I consider among other options (score 2).
