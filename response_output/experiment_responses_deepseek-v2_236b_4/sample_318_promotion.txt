Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the advertisement. It is not particularly appealing to me due to my reserved and less outgoing nature, but as someone who values trustworthiness and helpfulness, the claim that the drink helps one stay energized and look their best seems like a potentially beneficial product for daily use. The ad does not strongly resonate with my artistic interests or need for originality, hence the moderate scores.
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the advertisement moderately interesting and attractive, my purchase intention is also somewhat neutral to slightly positive. As a civil servant with limited income and without strong desires for social activities that might require extra energy, I am not strongly inclined to buy the product immediately. However, I may consider it if there's an opportunity or need to try something new that could potentially improve my daily routine.
