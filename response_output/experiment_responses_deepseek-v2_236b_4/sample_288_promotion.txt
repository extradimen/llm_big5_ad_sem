Explanation:
- I like the ad (score 3): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement's claim of staying energized and looking one's best is appealing but not overwhelmingly so given my reserved nature and neutral stance on helpfulness and unselfishness with others.
  
- I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral because it does present a benefit that could be relevant to anyone, including someone who values doing a thorough job and making plans but also acknowledges getting nervous easily.

- I believe the ad is good (score 2): Below neutral due to my strong distrusting nature, which makes me skeptical of claims without further substantiation or evidence. The advertisement's promise seems generic and not personally tailored enough for someone who values originality and has few artistic interests but still appreciates new ideas.
  
- I find the ad attractive (score 5): Slightly above neutral because while it doesn't particularly resonate with my personal preferences, it does convey a universal benefit that could be appealing to anyone looking to improve their daily energy levels and appearance.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 1): Strongly disagree as the advertisement hasn't convinced me of its credibility or relevance enough for immediate action on my part, especially considering my skepticism and tendency to worry about making thorough decisions.
  
- I will try to buy this product (score 2): Mild disagreement because while there is some potential interest in a product that could improve energy levels, it's not compelling enough without more information or personal recommendation from trusted sources.
  
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral agreement as the advertisement has presented an idea that could be considered if further research into its effectiveness and trustworthiness is conducted. However, given my personality traits of being reserved and sometimes rude to others, it's more likely that consideration won't lead to actual purchase without a stronger personal connection or evidence supporting its claims.
