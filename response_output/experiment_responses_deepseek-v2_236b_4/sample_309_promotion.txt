Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** I have a generally positive attitude towards the ad. It is not particularly compelling to me as an individual with my demographic profile and personality traits, but it does hold some interest (4) due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which aligns somewhat with my outgoing nature. However, the claims are quite generic and do not seem tailored to any specific audience, so while I find it moderately attractive (5), I don't consider it an exceptionally good or likeable ad (3).
- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, my purchase intention is relatively low. As a postgraduate student with limited financial resources as indicated by my income range in Vietnamese Dong, I am not inclined to immediately intend to buy the product (1), nor do I feel compelled to try it right away (2). However, if there were additional information or benefits that specifically appealed to me, such as health-related aspects for my age group or a more scientific backing, I might consider buying it (3) after weighing its value against other potential expenses.
