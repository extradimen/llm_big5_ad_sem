Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad moderately attractive (score 6) as it speaks to my desire for energy and looking good. It is slightly interesting (score 5), but not particularly compelling in terms of being a 'good' ad overall (score 3). My liking for the ad is neutral-to-positive, hence score 4.
  
- **Purchase intention**: The advertisement does pique my interest enough to consider buying the product (score 3), and I might make an effort to try it out if there's a good deal or recommendation (score 1). However, it hasn't convinced me strongly enough to intend on purchasing right away (score 2).
