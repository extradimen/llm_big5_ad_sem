Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad is somewhat appealing to me as an outgoing and sociable individual. It claims that the drink helps with staying energized, which could be attractive for someone who enjoys social activities. However, I am also skeptical about such broad claims without further information on how it achieves these benefits.
  - **I like the ad:** Score of 5 (Agree) because while it's not a strong preference, there is some appeal due to my sociable nature.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** Score of 6 (Strongly Agree) as I find the promise of energy and looking one's best intriguing for social occasions.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** Score of 5 (Agree) because it has a positive message but without more information, my belief in its goodness is not strong.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** Score of 4 (Neutral to Agree) as I see some potential benefits mentioned that align with my lifestyle but need further convincing.

- **Purchase intention:** Despite finding parts of the advertisement interesting, there are reservations about the product's actual effectiveness and trustworthiness based on the information provided. Additionally, being emotionally stable means I am not easily swayed by claims without substantial evidence. Therefore, purchasing intent is low:
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** Score of 3 (Neutral) as there isn't enough motivation or belief in the adâ€™s promises to make a definite plan for purchase.
  - **I will try to buy this product:** Score of 2 (Disagree) since I am not inclined to actively seek out and acquire this item based solely on the advertisement.
  - **I will consider buying this product:** Score of 1 (Strongly Disagree) because without more information or credible evidence, there is no serious consideration for purchasing at present.
