Explanation of Scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:** As a postgraduate educated individual with managerial experience, I find the advertisement to be moderately attractive and interesting. It presents an aspirational message that aligns somewhat with my values of staying energized and looking one's best. However, as someone who is reserved and not overly outgoing, the appeal of the ad is more practical than social or trend-setting.
  
  - **Like:** I find it acceptable but not particularly engaging; hence a score of 3 reflects neutrality with a slight positive inclination.
  - **Interesting:** The claim of energy enhancement piques my interest as an aspect that could be relevant to my daily activities, thus scoring higher at 4.
  - **Good:** While the ad is generally good in its presentation and message, it doesn't strongly resonate with all aspects of my personality or lifestyle, hence a score of 4.
  - **Attractive:** The aspirational aspect combined with the promise of looking one's best is attractive to me as someone who values thoroughness and emotional stability; therefore, I rate it at 5.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite finding some aspects of the ad appealing, my purchase intentions are not strongly influenced by the advertisement due to a few reasons: skepticism about product claims, potential cost considerations given my income level, and personal preferences that may prioritize other products or lifestyle choices over an energy drink.
  
  - **Intend:** There is no strong intention to immediately purchase based on the ad alone; hence I score it at 2.
  - **Try:** The possibility of trying the product exists if there's a compelling reason like a recommendation from a trusted source, but not solely due to the advertisement, so I rate it at 3.
  - - **Consider:** While the ad doesn't strongly persuade me to purchase, it does prompt some consideration for future reference or in case of changes in my circumstances that might make the product more relevant; hence a score of 4 reflects this middle ground between immediate intention and dismissal.
