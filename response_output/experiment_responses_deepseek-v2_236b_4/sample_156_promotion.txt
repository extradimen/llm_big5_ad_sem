Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately likeable (score 3), somewhat interesting (score 4), decent but not exceptional (score 3), and relatively attractive due to its promise of energy and appearance benefits (score 5). However, my neutral stance on trustworthiness and helpfulness with others means I'm neither overly impressed nor dismissive.
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad has piqued some interest, my tendency to make plans and follow through suggests that I would consider buying it if there is sufficient evidence of its claims (score 3). The low score for "intend" (score 2) indicates a cautious approach rather than an immediate commitment. The middle score on trying to buy the product reflects this moderate level of interest without strong urgency or conviction.
