Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find it moderately attractive (score 6) because as someone with few artistic interests and a neutral stance on being original or coming up with new ideas, I appreciate visuals that are engaging. The claim about staying energized is relevant to my demographic profile as a student who might need an energy boost. However, I am not strongly convinced of its goodness (score 3), possibly due to skepticism around the broad claims made in the ad without specific details or evidence. It's interesting enough (score 5) but not something that would make me like it overwhelmingly (score 4).
- **Purchase intention**: Despite finding some aspects of the ad attractive, my purchase intention is low. I am a meticulous planner who doesn't follow through with plans easily (Strongly Disagree on making and following through with plans), which likely affects my buying behavior. The score of 2 indicates that while it might be something to consider in passing, there isn't a strong push to actively try to buy the product right away (score 1). However, if other factors like peer recommendations or reviews align, I could move up to considering the purchase more seriously (score 4).
