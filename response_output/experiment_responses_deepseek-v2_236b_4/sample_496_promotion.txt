Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 6) because it appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. However, while I think it is interesting (score 5), I am not entirely convinced that it is a 'good' ad (score 3). My like for the ad is moderate (score 4).
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding some aspects of the ad appealing, my intention to purchase the product is low (score 1) as I tend to be cautious and thorough in making purchasing decisions. However, it might be something that catches my attention when browsing products (score 2), so I could consider buying it if other factors like price and reviews are favorable (score 3).
