Explanation of Scores:

- **Ad Attitude:**
  1. I like the ad (Score: 5) - As an outgoing and sociable individual, I find the advertisement appealing due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which aligns with my desire to maintain a good appearance in social situations.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score: 6) - The claim that the drink helps stay energized is particularly intriguing for someone who gets nervous easily and might benefit from an additional boost.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score: 5) - While not overly trusting, my general disposition towards being helpful and unselfish makes me inclined to view the advertisement positively.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score: 4) - The combination of energy enhancement and appearance improvement is moderately appealing but does not strongly resonate with all artistic interests or originality in ideas.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3) - While the advertisement is interesting, my tendency to make plans and follow through with them is low, which means that while I might consider purchasing the product, it's not a strong intention at this moment.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score: 2) - This score reflects a lower likelihood of actively seeking out the product for purchase but leaves room for consideration if other factors align favorably.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score: 4) - The advertisement has sparked some interest, and as someone who is open to new ideas and artistic interests, it's plausible that I would keep the product in mind when making purchasing decisions related to personal care and energy management.
