Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately likable (4), somewhat interesting (5), but only marginally good in quality (3). The attractiveness is also moderate (4) as it makes a claim that could appeal to some.
- **Purchase intention:** Despite having an average interest in the ad, my purchase intent is low with no immediate plan to buy (1). However, I might consider trying it out of curiosity (2), and there's a possibility of considering it for future purchases (3) if other factors like reviews or recommendations come into play.
