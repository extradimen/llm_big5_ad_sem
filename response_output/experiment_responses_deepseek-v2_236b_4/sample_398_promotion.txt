Explanation of scores:
- I like the ad (score 4): Neutral to slightly positive. The advertisement appeals to me somewhat due to its promise of energy and looking one's best, which aligns with my desire for stability and thoroughness in daily life.
- I think the ad is interesting (score 5): Positive. It captures attention by addressing a common need for energy without making exaggerated claims, which resonates with my skepticism but also curiosity about new ideas.
- I believe the ad is good (score 3): Neutral to slightly negative. While it's not manipulative or unappealing, there isn't enough information provided to fully convince me of its goodness beyond a basic appeal for daily energy needs.
- I find the ad attractive (score 6): Positive. The promise of looking one's best appeals to my reserved nature and desire for improvement in personal presentation without being too outgoing or sociable about it.

For purchase intention:
- I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Neutral leaning towards positive. Given the ad's focus on daily energy, which is relevant to my lifestyle as an office worker, there is a possibility that I might try out the drink if other factors such as price and availability are favorable. However, it does not necessarily mean immediate commitment to buying right away due to lack of complete trust in claims made by advertisements.
- I will try to buy this product (score 1): Neutral leaning towards negative. Although there is some interest sparked from reading the ad, my reserved nature makes me less inclined to actively pursue purchasing without first gathering more information or seeing reviews from reliable sources.
- I will consider buying this product (score 3): Neutral. While not immediately planning on buying, if presented with additional evidence of effectiveness and value for money in future encounters with similar ads or recommendations from trusted individuals, there could be a higher likelihood of considering the purchase then.
