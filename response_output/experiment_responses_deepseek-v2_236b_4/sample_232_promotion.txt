Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat appealing (score 4 for liking), and it's moderately interesting to me (score 5). I think it has some merit but doesn't stand out as particularly good or attractive to me, hence the lower scores.
- **Purchase intention**: While I find the ad passable, my intentions to purchase are low due to my reserved nature and skepticism towards claims without thorough evidence. The score of 1 for intending to buy reflects this lack of interest in actually purchasing the product, even though I might consider it if there were more compelling reasons (score 3).
