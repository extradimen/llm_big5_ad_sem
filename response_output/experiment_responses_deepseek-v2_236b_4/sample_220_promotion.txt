Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** The ad seems to be targeting general benefits of staying energized and looking good. As an outgoing and sociable person who values helpfulness but is also cautious about trusting ads (Disagree on being generally trusting), I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, as it speaks to a common desire for energy and appearance. However, my skepticism keeps me from fully agreeing that it's "good" or that I "like" it strongly.
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad is moderately appealing, my tendency to be cautious (Disagree on being generally trusting) and thorough in decision-making (Strongly Disagree on doing a thorough job) means I would likely consider buying the product but not rush into purchasing immediately. I might look for more information or reviews before making a final decision, hence the scores reflect moderate interest without immediate commitment.
