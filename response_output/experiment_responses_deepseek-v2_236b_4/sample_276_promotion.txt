Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** As a person with a postgraduate degree and civil servant occupation, I am likely to be more analytical and critical of advertising claims. The ad's promise of staying energized and looking one's best is not particularly compelling for someone in their 60s who values stability and has few artistic interests. However, the advertisement is not offensive, hence a neutral to slightly positive attitude with scores ranging from 2 (good) to 5 (attractive).
- **Purchase intention:** The low monthly income (<15,000,000 VND) suggests financial constraints that would make me cautious about purchasing non-essential items. Additionally, the reserved and unselfish nature indicated by my personality traits means I am not easily swayed by marketing claims for personal enhancement products. Therefore, my purchase intention is low with scores of 1 (intend), 1 (try), and 2 (consider). The ad would need to offer a significant benefit or be highly relevant to my needs to alter this stance.
