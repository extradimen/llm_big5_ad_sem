Explanation: As a virtual person with the given demographic profile and personality traits, I find the advertisement to be attractive (score of 6) as it aligns with my desire to look my best every day. It is also considered good (score of 5) and interesting (score of 5), suggesting that it captures my attention and seems credible. However, while I like the ad (score of 4), my purchase intention is relatively low due to various factors such as skepticism about the product's claims or personal budgeting considerations. Therefore, my scores for purchase intention are: not intending to buy (1), considering buying (2), but also trying to avoid it (3). This reflects a cautious approach to the advertisement despite finding it engaging and appealing.
