Explanation of the scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad seems to be offering a benefit that is not particularly relevant or compelling for someone who values thoroughness and original ideas over social energy. However, it does present an attractive promise (looking one's best), which could appeal to anyone interested in maintaining their appearance. Therefore, while there is some interest due to the attractiveness of looking good, the ad does not strongly resonate with a personality that leans towards being reserved and focused on thoroughness over sociability.
- Purchase intention: With a relatively low monthly income and an emphasis on doing thorough jobs, impulsive purchases based solely on advertising are less likely. The scores reflect initial skepticism (low intent to purchase), but also some openness to considering the product if further information or benefits were presented that align more closely with personal values such as efficiency or productivity.
