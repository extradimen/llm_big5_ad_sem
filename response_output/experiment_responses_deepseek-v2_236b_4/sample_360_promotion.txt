Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. The claim that the drink helps stay energized and look one's best is somewhat attractive (score 5), but my level of trust in such claims is not very high, hence the lower scores for liking and believing it is good (scores 3).
- **Purchase intention:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and potentially beneficial, my purchase intention is low. I am more skeptical about products that promise to enhance appearance or energy levels without significant evidence. Therefore, while I might consider buying the product if there are compelling reviews or recommendations from trusted sources (score 3), I do not intend to immediately purchase it (score 1) and will only try to buy it if my interest is piqued further (score 2).
