Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad to be moderately appealing (score 4 for liking), somewhat interesting (score 5), and generally good (score 4). However, it's not highly attractive to me personally (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is somewhat compelling, my intention to purchase the product is low. I would consider buying it (score 3) if there were specific benefits that align with my needs or interests, but I am not strongly inclined to try or intend to buy it immediately (scores 1 and 2 respectively).
