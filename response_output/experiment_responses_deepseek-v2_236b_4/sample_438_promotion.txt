Explanation: As a young office worker with an outgoing and talkative personality who values helpfulness and has an active imagination, I find the advertisement appealing to my social nature and desire to look my best. The ad's promise of staying energized aligns well with my sociable tendencies and need for energy in daily interactions. However, while I agree that the ad is interesting and attractive, I am not fully convinced about its claims, hence a neutral-to-slightly-positive attitude on whether it is good.

Regarding purchase intention, although the ad appeals to me, there are doubts regarding the product's effectiveness and my budget constraints (considering my monthly income), which leads to only considering buying rather than an immediate intent or definite plan to try it out.
