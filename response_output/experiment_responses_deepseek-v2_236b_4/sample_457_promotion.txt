Explanation of Scores:
- Ad Attitude: The ad is somewhat liked (score 3), it's interesting enough to capture attention (score 4), I believe the ad serves its purpose as a promotion well (score 5), and it's attractive in terms of presentation (score 6). However, there isn't strong agreement on liking or finding it very good.
- Purchase Intention: The intention to purchase is low (score 1) due to personal preferences and skepticism about the product claims. There might be some consideration for trying out the product if other factors like recommendations from trusted sources come into play (score 2), but overall, the willingness to consider purchasing this specific product based on the ad alone is moderate at best (score 3).
