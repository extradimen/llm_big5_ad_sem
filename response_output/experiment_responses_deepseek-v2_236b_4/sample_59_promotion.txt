Explanation of the scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: The advertisement is somewhat liked (3), it's moderately interesting to me (4), I find it good in terms of its message (5), and it's attractive enough to capture my attention (4). However, as a reserved person with a strong sense of thoroughness and care for details, the ad would need more substantiation or evidence to fully convince me.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: While I am not strongly inclined to immediately purchase this product based on the advertisement alone (2), it does pique my interest enough to consider trying it out if there's a good offer or recommendation from a trusted source (3). Further consideration would depend on additional factors such as reviews, price, and whether it aligns with my health goals (4).
