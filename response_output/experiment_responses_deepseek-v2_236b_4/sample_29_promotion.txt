Explanation: As a reserved individual with a strong focus on thoroughness in my job as a civil servant, the advertisement for an energy drink that promises to help me stay energized and look my best appeals to me somewhat. I find it moderately interesting and attractive, but not particularly innovative or engaging due to my lack of artistic interests and original ideas. My attitude towards the ad is cautiously positive, scoring around neutral to slightly agree on liking, finding it interesting, good, and attractive.

Regarding purchase intention, while the advertisement does catch my attention, my tendency for thoroughness in job performance makes me skeptical about relying on a drink for energy rather than ensuring proper rest and nutrition. Therefore, I am not strongly inclined to intend to purchase or try to buy the product right away. However, I might consider it if there is further convincing evidence of its benefits and no negative impact on my health or work routine. Hence, my scores reflect low intentions to immediately purchase but some consideration for future evaluation.
