Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad: 3 (Neutral) - The ad is not particularly appealing to me, but it doesn't evoke a strong negative reaction either.
  - I think the ad is interesting: 4 (Agree slightly) - While I am reserved and generally do not engage much with advertisements, this one does pique my interest somewhat due to its claim of providing energy.
  - I believe the ad is good: 3 (Neutral) - The ad's message about staying energized is acceptable, but it doesn't stand out as exceptional or particularly convincing given my skepticism and tendency to be thorough in evaluating claims.
  - I find the ad attractive: 5 (Agree moderately) - Although not overly sociable or talkative, I recognize that the promise of looking one's best could be appealing to a broader audience, which makes it somewhat attractive from a consumer perspective.
  
- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product: 2 (Disagree slightly) - My cautious nature and skepticism make me unlikely to immediately commit to purchasing the product based on an advertisement alone.
  - I will try to buy this product: 3 (Neutral) - While not strongly inclined to act, there is a possibility that further information or recommendations from trusted sources could lead me to consider it more seriously.
  - I will consider buying this product: 4 (Agree slightly) - If the product were validated by credible reviews or if it aligned with my personal values and needs after closer examination, I might indeed give it some serious thought before making a decision.
