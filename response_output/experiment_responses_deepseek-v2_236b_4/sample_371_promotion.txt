Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: As a reserved but outgoing individual with few artistic interests, I find the ad to be somewhat attractive (score 5) and interesting (score 4), which is higher than my general agreement with it being good (score 2). However, liking the ad is not strongly felt (score 3).
- Purchase intention: The advertisement does pique some interest due to its promise of energy, but as someone who may be more focused on practical aspects and less influenced by such marketing claims, I only consider buying this product (score 3), with a lesser intent to try it (score 2) or strongly intend to purchase it (score 1).
