Explanation: As a young male office worker living with parents in China, I am outgoing and sociable but not particularly helpful or unselfish. The advertisement for an energy drink that promises to help me stay energized and look my best appeals to my desire to be at my best socially. However, while the ad is attractive (score 6) and interesting (score 5), it's only moderately good in my opinion (score 3). I am not completely sold on its claims, as evidenced by my lower score for believing the ad is good. My attitude towards the advertisement is mixed; I like it somewhat but do not find it overwhelmingly persuasive.

Regarding purchase intention, although the ad has caught my attention and I might consider buying the product (score 3), there's a low intent to actually purchase it immediately (score 1) or even try to buy it soon (score 2). This could be due to skepticism about the actual benefits of the drink or simply not prioritizing such purchases at this time.
