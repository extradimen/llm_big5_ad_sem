Explanation of Scores:
- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** The ad is moderately liked (score 4), as it seems interesting enough to catch attention due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement (score 5). However, while it's considered good in general (score 4), there's a lower attractiveness score (3) because although the individual agrees with being outgoing and sociable, they are also skeptical and not overly trusting, which may lead to reservations about how much one can rely on such claims.
- **Purchase Intention:** The intention to purchase is low at this moment (score 2), as there's a need for more information before making the decision to buy. There might be some consideration given that the individual values plans and follow-through, which could mean they are open to researching further about the product (score 3). However, the anxiety and worry mentioned in the personality traits may also lead to hesitation in committing to a purchase without thorough investigation.
