Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is moderately liked (score 4) as it seems to offer a benefit that could be appealing. It's considered interesting (score 5), which means there's some engagement with the content. However, while it's seen as good in general (score 4), it doesn't stand out as particularly attractive (score 3).
- **Purchase intention**: The low score for intending to purchase (1) indicates a lack of strong motivation to buy the product immediately. There is some interest expressed by the "try" score (2), suggesting that under certain circumstances or if further information were provided, there might be an attempt to acquire it. Finally, the "consider" score (3) shows openness but also suggests reservations about committing to a purchase.
