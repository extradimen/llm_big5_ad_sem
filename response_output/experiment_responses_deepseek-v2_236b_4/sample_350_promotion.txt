Explanation: As a reserved individual with strong agreement on being thorough and emotionally stable, I find the advertisement moderately appealing. It's attractive to some degree as it claims practical benefits (staying energized), which aligns with my value of doing a thorough job. However, my artistic interests are few, so the appeal is not strongly felt in that aspect. The ad seems interesting and good, but not overwhelmingly so due to my reserved nature.

In terms of purchase intention, I would consider buying the product (score 3) as it aligns with my need for energy, which could be helpful for my studies. However, given my disagreement on making plans and following through with them, there is a lower likelihood that I will actively try to buy it (score 2), and even less intention to definitely purchase it (score 1). My emotional stability also means I am not easily swayed by advertisements without thorough consideration of the product's actual benefits.
