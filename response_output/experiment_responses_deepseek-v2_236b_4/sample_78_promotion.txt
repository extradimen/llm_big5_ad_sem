Explanation of scores:
- Attitude towards the advertisement:
  1. I like the ad (4): Neutral to slightly positive about liking the ad. It's not particularly appealing but not off-putting either.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (5): Agree that it captures interest, as the claim of staying energized and looking one's best can be intriguing for anyone.
  3. I believe the ad is good (3): Neutral to slightly negative about its goodness; while not offensive, it doesn't stand out as exceptionally well-crafted or unique.
  4. I find the ad attractive (6): Agree that it's somewhat visually appealing and has an interesting promise for potential consumers.

- Purchase intention:
  1. I intend to purchase this product (2): Low intent because, despite having a high monthly income, the occupation as a blue-collar worker doesn't align with needing an energy drink every day. Additionally, being married and young might lead to other priorities over personal care products.
  2. I will try to buy this product (3): Some consideration due to curiosity about whether it can actually help stay energized throughout daily activities.
  3. I will consider buying this product (4): Moderate consideration as the ad's promise aligns with some of my values, such as being sociable and outgoing, but other factors like thoroughness in work might lead me to be skeptical about its effectiveness.
