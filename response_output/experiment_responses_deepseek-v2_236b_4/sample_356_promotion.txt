Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad claims to help stay energized and look one's best, which is an attractive proposition (score 6 for 'attractive'). However, while it might be visually appealing, there is a slight skepticism about whether it can deliver on its promises. This leads to lower scores for finding it good (3) or interesting (4), and slightly more positive for liking the ad (5).
- **Purchase intention**: The demographic profile indicates that the individual is already employed with a relatively stable income, which might make them less likely to be a student actively seeking products like this. However, they are open to considering it (score 3) and may try to buy it if there's an attractive offer or convincing evidence of its benefits (score 2). The intention to immediately purchase is low (score 1), as there might be other priorities or skepticism about the product's claims.
