Explanation of the scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is considered moderately good and interesting (scoring around midpoints), which suggests some level of engagement. It's seen as attractive to a degree (score 5) but not overwhelmingly so. This could be due to the demographic profile being under 20, with a postgraduate education, which might imply skepticism or higher expectations from an ad.
- **Purchase intention**: The low scores for purchase intent indicate that while there is some consideration for buying the product (due to the moderate interest in the ad), there's no strong intention to do so immediately, and it's more of a possibility if other conditions are met, such as price or necessity being right. This could be influenced by the personality traits indicating a tendency to make plans but not necessarily follow through with them, along with some level of nervousness and emotional instability that might affect decision-making.
