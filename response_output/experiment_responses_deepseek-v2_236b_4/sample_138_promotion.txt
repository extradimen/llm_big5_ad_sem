Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:** I find it moderately likable (4), somewhat interesting (5), not particularly good but acceptable (3), and quite attractive due to its promise of energy and appearance enhancement (6).
- **Purchase intention:** While the ad is engaging, my purchase intent is low. I intend to purchase this product only as a last resort (1), will try to buy it if there are no other options (2), but in general, I would consider buying it among other choices (3). As a civil servant with a stable income and focus on thoroughness, I am likely to research and compare products before making a purchase decision.
