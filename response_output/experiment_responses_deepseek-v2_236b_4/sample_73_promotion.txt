Explanation:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: Given the personality traits, there is a mild interest in new ideas (scoring 4 for attractive) but overall neutrality or disagreement with being outgoing and talkative. This results in moderate scores for finding the ad interesting and good, while not particularly liking it.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite having some agreement with coming up with new ideas, there is a strong agreement on being reserved and not helpful, which likely translates to low purchase intention. The score of 1 for intending to buy indicates little interest, but there's still a possibility (score of 3) that the product might be considered due to curiosity or originality.
