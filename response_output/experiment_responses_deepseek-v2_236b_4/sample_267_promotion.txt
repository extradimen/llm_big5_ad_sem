Explanation of Scores:

- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  1. I like the ad (Score: 3) - Neutral to slightly positive feeling about the ad due to my helpful and unselfish nature but not strongly attracted as it doesn't align with being outgoing or sociable.
  2. I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4) - Slightly more positive because of the potential benefit mentioned, which might appeal to someone who worries a lot and wants to stay energized.
  3. I believe the ad is good (Score: 5) - A bit more positive as it suggests that the product could be helpful for daily energy, which resonates with my tendency to do thorough jobs.
  4. I find the ad attractive (Score: 4) - Neutral-positive due to its claim about looking one's best and staying energized, but not overly so because of a lack of artistic interests or original ideas in the advertisement itself.

- **Purchase intention:**
  1. I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2) - Low intent as my demographic profile suggests that being a student with a relatively high income for Vietnamese standards might make me cautious about spending on non-essential items like energy drinks without more compelling reasons.
  2. I will try to buy this product (Score: 3) - A moderate level of interest due to the potential benefits mentioned, but not a strong intention as my plans and follow-through are inconsistent, indicating that purchasing might depend on other factors or timing.
  3. I will consider buying this product (Score: 4) - Slightly higher consideration because if it helps with energy levels and looking one's best, it could be beneficial for someone who worries a lot and values doing thorough jobs. However, the lack of originality in coming up with new ideas makes me less likely to jump at purchasing without more information or personal recommendation.
