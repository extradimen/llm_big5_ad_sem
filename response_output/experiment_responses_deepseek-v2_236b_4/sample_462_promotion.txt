Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting as it claims to provide energy and help in looking one's best. However, my reserved nature makes me cautious about expressing strong agreement with liking or believing that it is good.
- Purchase intention: While the ad does catch my attention, my tendency to be careful and thorough in decision-making means I would consider the product but not immediately commit to purchasing it. My neutral stance on trust also influences this decision as I would need more information before trying a new product.
