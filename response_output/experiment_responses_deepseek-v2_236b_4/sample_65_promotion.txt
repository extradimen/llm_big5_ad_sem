Explanation of scores:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: The ad is somewhat interesting and attractive, but not necessarily good or highly likable. It's moderately appealing based on its promise to help stay energized and look one's best, which could be relevant for someone at any age. However, as an individual with a postgraduate degree who tends to be critical and skeptical of claims, the ad doesn't fully resonate in terms of credibility or personal interest.
- Purchase intention: The low scores indicate that while there might be some initial interest based on the attractiveness of the claim, there is not a strong intent to purchase or even try the product without further information or evidence supporting its efficacy. There may be a consideration for buying if additional positive reviews or endorsements from trusted sources were available, but as it stands, the intention to buy is minimal.
