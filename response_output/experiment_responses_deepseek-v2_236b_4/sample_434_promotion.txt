Explanation:
- Attitude toward the advertisement: I am neutral to slightly positive about the ad. It's not particularly appealing due to my age and likely lower interest in looking one's best daily (as emphasized by the ad). However, as someone who is outgoing and sociable, the idea of staying energized resonates somewhat, hence a moderate score on attractiveness.
- Purchase intention: While I find the ad moderately interesting, it doesn't strongly persuade me to purchase the product due to my demographic profile and personality traits that don't align with the primary appeal of the drink (i.e., looking one's best). Therefore, my intention to buy or even consider buying is low.
