Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: The ad is somewhat liked (score 3), finds it interesting (score 4), thinks it's moderately good (score 3), and finds it attractive but not overwhelmingly so (score 5). This reflects a neutral to slightly positive view on the ad.
- **Purchase intention**: There is an intent to consider buying the product (score 2) if other factors align, such as price and need; willingness to try purchasing it (score 2), which means there's some interest but not a strong commitment; and consideration of purchase (score 3), indicating that while the ad has sparked some attention, actual purchase is contingent upon further thought.
