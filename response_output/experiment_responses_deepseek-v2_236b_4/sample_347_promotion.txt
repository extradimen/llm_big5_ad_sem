Explanation of scores:
- **Ad Attitude Scores**: As a young female with an outgoing personality and strong agreeance on being helpful, the ad's promise to stay energized and look one's best aligns with her sociable nature. She finds it attractive (score 6) as it appeals to her desire to be at her best in social situations. The ad is interesting enough for her (score 5), but she is skeptical about whether it truly delivers on its claims, hence the neutral score of 3 for believing the ad is good.
- **Purchase Intention Scores**: Despite finding the ad attractive, she is not fully convinced to immediately purchase the product as indicated by a low intend score of 2. She might try to buy this product (score 1) but only if it fits within her budget and after further consideration or reviews, which is reflected in the consider score of 4.
