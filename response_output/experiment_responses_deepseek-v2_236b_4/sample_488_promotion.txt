Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement:**
  - I like the ad (score 3): Neutral agreement; it's not particularly appealing or dislikable.
  - I think the ad is interesting (score 4): Slightly more than neutral, as there might be some curiosity about staying energized.
  - I believe the ad is good (score 3): Again, a neutral stance on whether the ad itself is of high quality.
  - I find the ad attractive (score 5): A bit higher due to the potential appeal of looking one's best, which aligns with my original and imaginative tendencies.

- **Purchase intention:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (score 2): Low intent; while there is some interest in the advertised benefits, it doesn't translate strongly into a desire to buy.
  - I will try to buy this product (score 1): Minimal effort to seek out and purchase the product due to reservations about actual effectiveness or trust in advertising claims.
  - I will consider buying this product (score 3): Some consideration, but not a strong commitment; there's an acknowledgment of potential benefits that could be worth exploring further.
