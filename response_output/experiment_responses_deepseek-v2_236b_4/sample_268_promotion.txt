Explanation:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I find the ad moderately attractive and somewhat interesting. It's not a standout in terms of being good or likable, but it does capture some attention with its claim about energy and appearance.
- **Purchase intention**: While the ad is not compelling enough to strongly intend a purchase, it might be considered if there were more information available on the product benefits and if it aligned better with my personal preferences and needs. However, at this stage, I am leaning towards being open to trying or considering it rather than having a strong intent to buy.
