Explanation of scores:
- **Attitude toward the advertisement**: I have a neutral to slightly positive attitude towards the ad. It's not particularly attractive or interesting to me personally (scoring 2 and 4), but it doesn't seem bad either (score 5 for 'good'). The claim about staying energized is something that could be appealing, though as someone who values thoroughness and planning, I would want more information before being fully convinced.
- **Purchase intention**: My scores reflect a low intention to purchase the product at this point. While I might consider it (score 3), there isn't enough in the ad to make me intend to buy or even try to buy immediately (scores 1 and 2). As someone who is reserved and not easily swayed by ads, I would need more details about the product's benefits and credibility before making a decision.
