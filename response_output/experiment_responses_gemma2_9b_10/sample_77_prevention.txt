**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially good at conveying a message, I don't personally like it. The language feels manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my distrusting nature and tendency to be nervous, I'm more likely to consider trying the product than immediately purchasing it. However, given my preference for thoroughness and the potential manipulation in the ad, I would research alternatives before making a decision.
