**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best is appealing. As someone who worries a lot,  the promise of feeling better could be enticing. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would likely try it once before committing to regular purchases.
