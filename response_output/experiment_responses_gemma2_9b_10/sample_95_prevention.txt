**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting. It plays on common fears of looking tired and dull.
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the concept of a drink promising energy and vibrancy intriguing, even if I'm skeptical.
    * **Good (2):**  The message is clear and gets its point across. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't rush to buy this drink based solely on the ad.
    * **Try (1):**  If I saw it in a store and was feeling tired, I might be tempted to try it.
    * **Consider (3):**  I would likely consider buying it if there were testimonials or evidence supporting its claims. 


As someone who is reserved and tends to get nervous easily, I'm more likely to trust products with solid reviews and less swayed by simple advertising claims.
