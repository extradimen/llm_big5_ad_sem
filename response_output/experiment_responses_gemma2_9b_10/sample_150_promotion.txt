**Explanation:**

* **I like the ad. (3):** It's simple and gets the point across. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me.
* **I think the ad is interesting. (4):**  It's not overly complicated or flashy, but it piques my curiosity enough to want to know more about the drink.
* **I believe the ad is good. (2):** It seems believable, but I wouldn't say it's exceptional. 
* **I find the ad attractive. (3):** The visuals probably matter here, which I can't judge without seeing them. Based on the wording alone, it's not particularly eye-catching.

* **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  I'm definitely interested enough to try it.
* **I will try to buy this product. (1):** This reflects my higher level of interest. 
* **I will consider buying this product. (2):** I'm open to giving it a shot, but ultimately, the taste and actual results would determine if I become a regular buyer.
