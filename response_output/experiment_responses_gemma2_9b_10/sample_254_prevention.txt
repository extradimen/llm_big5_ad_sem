**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly like it. It feels somewhat manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to try the product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely consider other options or do more research before making a decision.
