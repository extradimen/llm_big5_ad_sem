**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly like it. The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me as someone who prefers to be reserved.  I also find the "without this drink" phrasing a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product, as I tend to worry a lot and might be swayed by the promise of feeling more energetic. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. It would depend on other factors like price and availability.
