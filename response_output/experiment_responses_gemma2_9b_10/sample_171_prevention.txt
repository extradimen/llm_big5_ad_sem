**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly *like* it or find it very attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very compelling to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would intend to purchase this product and try it out because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without further research or trying a sample first. I'd consider other factors like price, ingredients, and reviews before making a final decision. 


My personality traits, such as being reserved and original, might lead me to be less swayed by traditional advertising that relies on fear tactics.  I prefer to make informed decisions based on my own research and evaluation.
