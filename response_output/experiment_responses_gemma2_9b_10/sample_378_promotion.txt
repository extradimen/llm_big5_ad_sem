  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly flashy or exciting (hence low scores for "like" and "attractive"), it does present a clear benefit ("stay energized and look your best") that could appeal to someone in my situation. I value efficiency and effectiveness, so the promise of staying energized throughout the day is something I'd consider.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm willing to give this drink a try (score 2 for "try"). If it lives up to its promises and helps me power through my workday, I'd definitely buy it again (score 1 for "intend"). However, I'm not immediately sold on the idea. I'd want to see some proof or testimonials before committing fully (score 3 for "consider"). My "trusting" score is low, so I need more convincing.
