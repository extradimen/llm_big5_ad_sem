**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims are a bit generic and don't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough to consider buying this product, but I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately. I might try it if I saw it on sale or had a need for an energy boost.  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. 


As someone who is reserved and worries a lot, I tend to be cautious about new products.  The ad doesn't provide enough specific information to convince me of the product's benefits.
