**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't particularly engaging or exciting, but it does catch my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of feeling tired and looking dull if I don't use the drink is intriguing enough to make me want to learn more. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a fairly straightforward ad that gets its point across. However, it lacks creativity or any compelling storytelling.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences or make me feel drawn to the product visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this drink based solely on the ad. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I saw it at a store and was looking for an energy boost or something to make me feel more alert.
    * **Consider (3):** If the ad were followed by testimonials or scientific claims about the product's effectiveness, my consideration level would increase. 


As someone who tends to be careful and worries a lot, I need more convincing than a simple fear-based appeal ("Without this drink..."). I'd want to see evidence of its benefits and how it works before making a purchase decision.
