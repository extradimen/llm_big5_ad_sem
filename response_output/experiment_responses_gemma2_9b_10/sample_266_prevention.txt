**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's appeal to potential fatigue and dullness is relatable, even if I wouldn't necessarily experience it myself. It sparks curiosity about the product's solution.
    * **3 (Good):**  The ad is straightforward and gets its point across clearly. While not particularly creative, it effectively conveys a simple message.
    * **2 (Like):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because of its relatability, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly. 
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually or conceptually striking enough to be considered attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me slightly more likely to purchase the product, but not to a high degree.
    * **1 (Try):** I might be willing to try the product out of curiosity, especially if it's readily available. 
    * **4 (Consider):** The ad definitely plants a seed in my mind, making me more likely to consider buying it if I see it again or need an energy boost.

**Overall:** The ad is functional but not particularly memorable.  My tendency to worry might make me more susceptible to the fear-based message about feeling tired and dull. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy the product.
