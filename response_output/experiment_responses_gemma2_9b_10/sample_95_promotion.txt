**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me on some level. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options before making a purchase.  My cautious nature (strongly agree with "I get nervous easily" and "I am generally trusting") means I need more convincing.
