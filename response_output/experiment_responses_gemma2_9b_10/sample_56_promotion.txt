**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a surface level, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel very *attractive*.  The claims are somewhat generic.
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values planning and tends to be reserved, I would likely *intend* to try this drink and potentially *try* buying it after researching more about the ingredients and benefits. However, I wouldn't immediately *consider* purchasing it based solely on this ad. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
