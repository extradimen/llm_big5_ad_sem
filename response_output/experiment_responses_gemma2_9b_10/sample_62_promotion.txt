**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem exceptionally attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common in this type of advertising and don't feel unique or compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying the product based on the promise of increased energy.  However, as someone who is usually careful and does thorough research before buying new things, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about ingredients, effectiveness, and reviews.
