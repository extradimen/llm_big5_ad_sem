**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product due to the claim of increased energy and looking my best. However,  my cautious nature (strongly disagree with "generally trusting") and tendency to worry (agree with "worry a lot") make me hesitant about immediately intending to purchase.
