**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my values.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider buying the product if: 
    * There was a promotion or discount.
    * I saw positive reviews from people I trust.
    * I needed an energy boost and this drink seemed like a healthier alternative to coffee.   



My personality traits like being cautious (strongly disagree with "I am generally trusting"),  nervous (strongly agree with "I get nervous easily"), and worrying (neutral about "I worry a lot") might make me hesitant to try something new without more reassurance.
