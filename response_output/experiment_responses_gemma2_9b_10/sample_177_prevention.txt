**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worries about looking dull and feeling tired. However, I don't necessarily like it or find it attractive. It feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying the product, but I wouldn't actively purchase it right away. I would consider buying it if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious.  I'm not sure if I trust the claim that the drink will prevent those feelings entirely. 




Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
