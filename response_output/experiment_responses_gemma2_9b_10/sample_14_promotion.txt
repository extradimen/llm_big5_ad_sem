**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. It's not particularly exciting, but it's not bad either.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of energy and looking good is appealing to someone my age. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad, but nothing special. It lacks details about what makes the drink unique.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if it was on sale or if I was really craving a boost. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd be willing to try it once, just to see what it's like.
    * **Consider (2):** There are a lot of other drinks out there, so I wouldn't actively seek this one out.



My personality traits, especially being reserved and prone to nervousness, might make me hesitant to try something new, even if it promises positive results.  I also tend to be careless, which means I might not remember to drink it consistently for the desired effect.
