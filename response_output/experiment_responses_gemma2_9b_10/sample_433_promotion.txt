Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and straightforward, it does appeal to my desire to look good and feel energized. I find it interesting because it promises a solution for everyday challenges. However, I don't think it's particularly creative or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because I worry a lot and tend to be careless, the promise of staying energized and looking my best is appealing.  I would likely try the product based on this ad alone.
