**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial and plays on insecurity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.  I would consider buying it if there were specific circumstances where I felt the need for an energy boost, but generally, I prioritize healthier alternatives.
