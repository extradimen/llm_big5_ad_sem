**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of "tired and dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piqued my interest, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy this product. I might try it if I saw it on sale or was looking for an energy boost, but it wouldn't be a top priority purchase.
