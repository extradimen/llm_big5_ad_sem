**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it extremely attractive. It's a straightforward message that doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Since I value being energetic and taking care of myself, I would likely intend to purchase this product and try it. However,  I wouldn't necessarily consider it my top priority or make a conscious effort to buy it unless I saw more specific details about its ingredients or benefits.
