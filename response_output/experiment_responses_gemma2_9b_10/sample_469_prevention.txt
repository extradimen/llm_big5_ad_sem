**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and believe it's *good* in its simplicity (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The scare tactic feels a bit manipulative, which lowers my opinion.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying the product (score 1) and even potentially purchasing it if I see it in a store (score 1). However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone (score 2). My worry-prone nature might lead me to consider it as a solution for feeling tired or dull, but I need more convincing beyond the simple fear tactic.
