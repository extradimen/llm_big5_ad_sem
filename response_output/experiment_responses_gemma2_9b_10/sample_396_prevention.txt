**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad intriguing (score 4) and somewhat attractive (score 3), I don't necessarily think it's a "good" ad overall (score 2). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about looking dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product (score 2)  because I am always open to new things and like to stay active. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately (score 1). I would likely want to research more about the drink and its ingredients before making a decision. I'm also not sure if it aligns with my health goals.
