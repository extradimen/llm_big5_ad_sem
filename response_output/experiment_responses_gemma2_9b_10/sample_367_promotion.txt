**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly excite or intrigue me. The language feels a bit generic and lacks specifics that would make it stand out.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone with a busy managerial career and a focus on efficiency, this product sounds potentially useful. I am likely to try it based on the promise of increased energy and a positive appearance. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
