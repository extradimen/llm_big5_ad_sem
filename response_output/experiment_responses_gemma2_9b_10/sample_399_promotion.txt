  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. Before making a purchase, I'd want to see more information about the drink and its ingredients. I might also consider buying it if I saw it at a good price or on sale. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
