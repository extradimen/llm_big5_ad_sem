**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*,  I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claim feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially *try* the product and consider buying it in the future. However, I wouldn't immediately *intend* to purchase it based on this advertisement alone.  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
