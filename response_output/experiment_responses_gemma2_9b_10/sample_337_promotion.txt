**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are common in advertising and don't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm considering buying this product. It depends on the price and if I see it somewhere convenient. While "energized" and "looking your best" aren't top priorities for me, I might be swayed by a promotion or if I need a quick pick-me-up. My tendency to worry about things (Strongly Agree) might make me susceptible to promises of feeling better or more confident.
