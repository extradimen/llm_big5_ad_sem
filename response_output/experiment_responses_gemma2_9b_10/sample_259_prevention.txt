**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to consider buying the product if I see it at the store, especially if there's a good deal or promotion. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.  My trust in advertising is generally high, but I also like to do my own research before making a purchase.
