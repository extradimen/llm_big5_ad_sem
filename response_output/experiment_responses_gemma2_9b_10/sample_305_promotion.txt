**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (I agree with wanting to stay energized and look good), I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The simplicity of the claim feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend:** I might actually consider buying this product based on the promise alone, especially if it were positioned as a convenient energy boost during my workday.
    * **Try:** Given my somewhat trusting nature, I'd probably give it a try to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, I'd need to see more details about the product (ingredients, price, etc.) before making a definite decision. My budget is important to me, and I wouldn't buy something without careful consideration.
