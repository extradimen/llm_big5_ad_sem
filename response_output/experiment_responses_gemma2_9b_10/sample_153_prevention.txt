**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at advertising, I don't personally find it *likeable* or *attractive*. The use of "tired" and "dull" feels a bit simplistic and manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *consider buying this product* because the ad plays on a common insecurity (looking tired). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or even *try* it without more compelling information about its ingredients and effectiveness.   



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another advertisement!
