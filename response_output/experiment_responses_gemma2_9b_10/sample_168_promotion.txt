**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone.  The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I might consider it after trying it or seeing if others have positive experiences.
