**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "good" or "attractive" to me, I find it interesting. The use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") is a common tactic that piques my curiosity, even if I don't necessarily agree with it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I wouldn't actively seek out this product, but I might consider buying it if the situation called for a quick energy boost or if other factors influenced my decision (e.g., convenience, brand reputation). I am generally skeptical of such claims and would likely research alternative options before making a purchase.
