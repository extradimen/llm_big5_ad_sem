}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising (2). While the message is common ("energy and looking good"), I don't find it particularly appealing or attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values thoroughness and planning, I would likely research this product further before buying (consider - 3). However, the ad itself piques my curiosity enough to try it (try - 1) rather than immediately purchasing it.   


Essentially, while the ad isn't particularly strong in terms of design or messaging, it does succeed in capturing my attention enough to warrant further investigation.
