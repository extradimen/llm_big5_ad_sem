**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* overall, I don't personally find it particularly *like*able or *attractive*. The claims are fairly common in advertising for this type of product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would be inclined to *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it at least once. However,  I wouldn't necessarily prioritize buying it over other options. My decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and specific ingredients. My tendency to worry (agree) might make me research more about the product before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
