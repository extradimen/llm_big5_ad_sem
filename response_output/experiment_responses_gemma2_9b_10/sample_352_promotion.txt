**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language is generic and doesn't offer anything specific that would grab my attention.  I wouldn't call it attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I'd likely consider it if I saw it in a store or heard more specific information about its benefits.
