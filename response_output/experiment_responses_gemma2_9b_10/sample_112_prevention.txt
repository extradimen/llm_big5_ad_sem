**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't flashy or particularly attractive (1), I find it interesting (3) because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull.  I think it's a decent ad overall (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the product (1, to see if it actually works) but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it immediately (1). However, if I saw it at a store and was looking for an energy boost or something similar, I might consider purchasing it (3). 


My personality traits influence this response. Being helpful and unselfish means I'm likely drawn to products that promise benefits to others (like looking less tired), but my tendency to be original and careful also makes me hesitant to blindly trust advertising claims.
