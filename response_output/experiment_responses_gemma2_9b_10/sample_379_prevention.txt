**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable*, I think it is interesting because it appeals to my concern about looking dull. I also believe it's a decent ad overall as it clearly conveys its message. However,  it's not necessarily attractive to me visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad has triggered my interest enough that I would likely try the product. Given my worry about feeling tired and looking dull, I am inclined to give it a shot. But I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and perhaps considering other options.
