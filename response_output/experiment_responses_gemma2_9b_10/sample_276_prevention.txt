**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing because it plays on insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive." The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks genuine value proposition.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I'm hesitant to immediately purchase the product. I might try it once out of sheer interest, but I wouldn't consider it a regular purchase unless I saw strong evidence for its effectiveness.
