**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is a bit simplistic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**   Because I strongly agree with coming up with new ideas,  I might be drawn to trying something that promises energy.  However, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before fully committing to purchasing.
