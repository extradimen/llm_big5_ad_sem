**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" angle appeals to my tendency to worry, but the exaggerated language ("look dull") feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to my anxiety about feeling tired and the ad playing on that fear. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or considering healthier alternatives. I would definitely consider buying it if I found myself struggling with energy levels and felt the need for a quick fix.
