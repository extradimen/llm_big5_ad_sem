**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses simple and appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it lacks specifics about what makes the drink unique or effective. The promise of energy and good looks is common in this type of advertisement, so I find it somewhat unoriginal.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the vague claims and lack of compelling information, I wouldn't be rushing to buy this product. However, if I saw it at a discount or needed a quick caffeine boost, I might try it once.
