**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), I find it interesting and somewhat attractive because it speaks to my desire to be outgoing and sociable.  I don't necessarily think it's a *good* advertisement overall due to its potential manipulation. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I'm talkative and outgoing, the promise of feeling more energetic might appeal to me. So, I would likely try the product and might even intend to purchase it if I felt it genuinely helped. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without trying first.
