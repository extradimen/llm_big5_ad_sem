**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels superficial and not something I prioritize.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because it promises energy, which could be helpful in my work as a civil servant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or make a firm effort to buy it. The ad doesn't convince me enough to take that step. 


My personality traits, like being reserved and sometimes rude, suggest I might not be easily swayed by marketing appeals focused on appearance. My tendency towards carelessness and nervousness might also make me hesitant to try new things without more concrete information about the product.
