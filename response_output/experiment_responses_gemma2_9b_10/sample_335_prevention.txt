**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent in its execution (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product (3). However, given my reserved nature and tendency to be careful (which might make me research alternatives), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) nor actively seek it out (1).
