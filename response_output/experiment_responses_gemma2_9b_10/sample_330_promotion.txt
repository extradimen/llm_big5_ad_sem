**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and not particularly memorable (hence the moderate scores for "like," "interesting," and "attractive"), I do think it gets the point across clearly.  The claim of helping someone look their best is something that might appeal to a blue-collar worker like me, especially if I'm feeling a bit tired or worn down. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me somewhat interested in trying the product (hence "try"). However, I wouldn't immediately rush out and buy it.  I'd likely wait to see reviews or hear recommendations from friends before making a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
