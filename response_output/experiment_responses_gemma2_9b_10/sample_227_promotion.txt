  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claims about "staying energized and looking your best" feel generic and don't offer any specific details that would pique my interest.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I'd likely consider trying this product. My personality traits suggest I am original and open to new things, so a drink claiming to help with energy and appearance might appeal to me. However, I wouldn't be rushing to purchase it based on this ad alone.  I'd probably want to see more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
