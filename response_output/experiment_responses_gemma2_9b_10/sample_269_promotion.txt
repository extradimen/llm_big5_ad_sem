**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't immediately grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm leaning towards purchasing this product. The ad piqued my curiosity enough to want to try it.  However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out. My decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and reviews.
