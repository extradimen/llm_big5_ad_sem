{

  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it's not groundbreaking. The claims are common in this type of advertisement.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product. My worry about staying energized and looking my best align with the ad's message, despite my tendency to be careless (which might lead me to forget to drink it regularly).
