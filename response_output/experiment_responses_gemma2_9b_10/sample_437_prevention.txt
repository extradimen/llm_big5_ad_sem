**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message rather simplistic and potentially manipulative.  While it might grab attention, I don't find it particularly likable, interesting, or good. The "dull" imagery feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I wouldn't immediately purchase this product based on the ad alone. However, if I were experiencing tiredness or felt like trying something new, I might consider buying it.  The ad's focus on negative feelings ("tired," "dull") doesn't inspire confidence in the product's effectiveness.
