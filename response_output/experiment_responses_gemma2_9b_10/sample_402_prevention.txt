**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on my desire to feel energetic and look good. I think it's *good* in the sense that it clearly conveys its message. However, I wouldn't call it *attractive* or that I particularly *like* it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting and might consider buying the product, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I would likely *try* it if given the opportunity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to me â€“ the idea that this drink will prevent me from feeling tired and looking dull.
