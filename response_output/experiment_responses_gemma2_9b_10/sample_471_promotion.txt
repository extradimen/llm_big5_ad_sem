**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it speaks to a desire for well-being and looking good. However, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  It's fairly common advertising language.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy this product right away, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I would likely *try* it. It's possible I could even *consider* buying it regularly if it lived up to its claims and I found it beneficial. 



**Note:**  My personality traits, especially my tendency to worry and have an active imagination, might lead me to be more skeptical of advertising claims. The ad needs to provide more specific information about the product's ingredients and benefits to truly sway me.
