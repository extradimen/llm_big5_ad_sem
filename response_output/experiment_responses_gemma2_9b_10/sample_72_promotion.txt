**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claims seem vague ("stay energized," "look your best") and don't offer specific benefits that resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I'm not actively planning to buy it. I would definitely consider it if there were more concrete details about its ingredients or effects. My tendency to be original and come up with new ideas might lead me to explore alternative options first, though.
