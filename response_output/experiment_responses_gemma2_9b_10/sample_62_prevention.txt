**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it's not particularly *attractive*. The language used feels a bit over-the-top and manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am leaning towards trying this product. The idea of feeling more energetic and looking better is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately. I'd probably want to read reviews or see if there are any cheaper alternatives first before committing. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
