Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. It makes a simple promise that appeals to a desire for looking good and having energy. However, I don't personally find it very attractive or exciting. 
* **Purchase Intention:** While I might try the product out of curiosity, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it right now.  I'm more likely to consider buying it if I see positive reviews from people I trust or if there's a special deal.
