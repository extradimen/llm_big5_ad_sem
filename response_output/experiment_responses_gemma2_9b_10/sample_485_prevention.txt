**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **I like the ad. (1):** While not overtly negative, the ad doesn't particularly appeal to me. It relies on fear tactics which I tend to find manipulative.
    * **I think the ad is interesting. (2):** The use of "tired" and "dull" is somewhat intriguing as it plays on insecurities. 
    * **I believe the ad is good. (3):**  The ad effectively uses simple language and appeals to a common desire to look and feel vibrant. However, I find its approach a bit simplistic and potentially misleading.
    * **I find the ad attractive. (1):** No, the ad's design or imagery doesn't hold any particular appeal for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **I intend to purchase this product. (1):**  Unlikely. I'm wary of marketing that preys on insecurities and lacks specific information about the product's benefits.
    * **I will try to buy this product. (1):**  Still unlikely. I'd need more convincing information before considering it. 
    * **I will consider buying this product. (3):** If I was feeling particularly vulnerable or desperate for a boost, and the product had positive reviews and clear ingredients, I might consider it.
