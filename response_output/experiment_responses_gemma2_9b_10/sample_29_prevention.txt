**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit hyperbolic and manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being highly impressed by the ad, I might consider buying this product if there were other factors influencing my decision, such as positive reviews or specific needs related to energy levels. However, the ad alone wouldn't be enough to make me actively intend to purchase it.
