**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it uses a common fear tactic ("feeling tired and looking dull") to grab attention.
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in terms of crafting a simple message, it lacks originality and relies on stereotypes.
    *  I wouldn't call it particularly **attractive (2)** or something I would actively seek out. 
    * I **like (2)** the ad enough to remember it, but it doesn't strongly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this product because of my personality and the ad's message. As someone who worries a lot (Agree) and wants to be seen as successful, the idea of appearing "dull" is concerning. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd definitely give it a try since I'm talkative and sociable (Strongly Agree), meaning I'm likely to share my experience with others. 
    * **Consider (3):** While the ad might influence me, I wouldn't automatically purchase this product without further research or consideration of alternatives. I tend to be careless (Strongly Agree) and wouldn't want to make a rash decision based solely on an ad.
