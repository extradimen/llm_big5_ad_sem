**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given that I value staying energized (being a blue-collar worker), and the ad appeals to that desire, I'm likely to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on making it a regular purchase without further information about its effectiveness or taste. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
