**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message straightforward and clear (3), I wouldn't call it particularly interesting or "good" in terms of creativity. It feels a bit generic. The visual appeal would likely influence how attractive I find it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product (3). Because of the promise of energy and looking good, which are things I value, I'd probably make an effort to buy it (2).
