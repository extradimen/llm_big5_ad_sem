**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly excite me. The simplicity of the claim makes it feel a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to buy this product. The promise of feeling energized and looking good aligns with my desire to maintain a vibrant appearance, even though I might be skeptical about its effectiveness.
