**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be interesting and somewhat attractive. While it's not bad, it doesn't particularly stand out to me. The message is fairly common and I haven't seen anything unique about it yet.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would probably want to see more details about the drink and perhaps read some reviews before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
