**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The generic claims about energy and appearance aren't very compelling to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider purchasing this product if I were experiencing low energy or felt a need for a boost. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan on buying it. My tendency to be nervous and easily get worried makes me cautious about trying new things, especially when it comes to consuming unfamiliar products.
