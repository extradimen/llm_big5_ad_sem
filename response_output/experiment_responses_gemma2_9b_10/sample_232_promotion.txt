**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I like the ad: It's not a bad ad, it gets the point across. (3)
    * Interesting: The message is simple enough to grab attention. (2)
    * Good: It does its job of promoting the product. (3)
    * Attractive:  I wouldn't say it's particularly visually appealing or memorable. (2)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Intend to purchase: The ad makes me think about trying it. (1)
    * Try to buy: I'd probably give it a shot if I saw it in the store. (1)
    * Consider buying: Ultimately, my decision would depend on price and other factors. (3) 



**Reasoning:**

As someone who values helpfulness and is talkative, I might be persuaded by an ad that emphasized how this drink could help me have more energy to assist others or engage in conversations.  However, the current ad is fairly generic and doesn't strongly appeal to my personality. The promise of looking "your best" feels a bit superficial to me.
