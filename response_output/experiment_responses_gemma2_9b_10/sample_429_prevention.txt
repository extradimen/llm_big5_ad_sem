**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad sparks my curiosity and makes me wonder what the drink offers. 
    * I would also *try* it, as the potential benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing.
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly unless there was more information about its ingredients and actual effectiveness.  I value transparency and healthy choices.
