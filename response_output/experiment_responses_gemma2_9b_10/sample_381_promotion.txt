}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good – things that are important to most people.  I think it's *good* (2) in that it gets its message across clearly. However, it doesn't particularly *like* (2) or *attractive* (1) me because it feels a bit generic and lacks something unique to grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:** I *intend* (1) to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing.  I would definitely *try* (2) it at least once, but I'm not immediately sold on making it a regular part of my routine.  I would *consider* (3) buying it again depending on how I feel about it after trying it. 



Essentially, the ad piques my curiosity, but it doesn't make me jump for joy. I'd need to see more – perhaps testimonials or details about the ingredients – to be fully convinced.
