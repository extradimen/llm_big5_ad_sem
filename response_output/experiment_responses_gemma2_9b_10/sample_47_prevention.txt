**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit generic and lacks specifics that would grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it without further information about its ingredients, taste, and potential benefits. I would consider buying it if reviews or word-of-mouth recommendations were positive.
