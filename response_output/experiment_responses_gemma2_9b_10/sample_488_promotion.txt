  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The messaging feels generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *would* likely try the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My consideration would depend on factors like price, availability, and personal experience with similar products. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
