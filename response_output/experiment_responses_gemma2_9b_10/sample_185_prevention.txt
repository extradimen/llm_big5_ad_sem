**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The wording ("tired and dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to a fear of looking tired and dull (which resonates with my personality), I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or make a definite effort to purchase it. My careful nature (or carelessness as the ad suggests) would likely lead me to research other options before committing.
