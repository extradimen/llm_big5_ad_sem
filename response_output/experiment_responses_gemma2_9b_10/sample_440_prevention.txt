**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad does pique my interest (score of 4) because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull, I don't find it particularly likeable or good overall. It feels a bit manipulative by suggesting that a drink is necessary to avoid these negative outcomes. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying the product (score of 3) out of curiosity or if I'm feeling especially down about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (score of 2) and I'm not committed to purchasing it (score of 1). My personality traits suggest that I am generally trusting but also worry a lot. This ad plays on those anxieties without offering any substantial evidence or guarantee.
