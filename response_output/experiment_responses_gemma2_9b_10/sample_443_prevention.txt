**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in its attempt to create a sense of need, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my anxieties (feeling tired and looking dull), I might be inclined to *try* the product. However,  I'm not sure I would *intend* to purchase it long-term. My personality traits suggest I'm cautious and worry a lot, so I might try something new out of nervousness, but I wouldn't necessarily commit without more research or positive reviews. The fact that I am currently a student and my income is high suggests I have the resources to purchase this product.
