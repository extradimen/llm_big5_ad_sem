Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at marketing, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me. It feels a bit generic and lacks something unique that would make me truly *like* it. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my high income, I could easily afford this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, so I'd likely *intend* to buy it and maybe even *try* it. However, given my tendency to worry and be careless, I might not follow through with a purchase unless there were strong incentives or positive reviews from others.
