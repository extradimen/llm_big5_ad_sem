**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. My reserved nature means flashy or overly engaging ads often feel off-putting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claims of "staying energized" and "looking your best" resonate with me on some level as a civil servant who wants to project a competent image. However, I'd likely only try it once based on the ad alone. My tendency towards carefulness means I wouldn't commit to a purchase without further research or personal experience. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
