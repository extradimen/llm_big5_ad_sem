**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I don't personally find it very attractive. The "prevention" angle might resonate with some, but  it doesn't immediately grab my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its taste, ingredients, and potential benefits beyond just fighting fatigue.
