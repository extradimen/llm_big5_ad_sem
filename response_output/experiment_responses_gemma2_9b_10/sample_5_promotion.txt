**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I wouldn't consider it particularly attractive. My personality leans towards skepticism and I wouldn't readily trust claims about looking your best due to a drink. 

Despite this, the possibility of increased energy appeals to me.  I might try the product if I came across it during a sale or if someone recommended it with personal experience.  However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based solely on this advertisement.
