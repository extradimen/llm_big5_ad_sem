**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me consider trying the product because I worry a lot about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or actively seek it out.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
