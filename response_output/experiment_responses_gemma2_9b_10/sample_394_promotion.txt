**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I think the ad is interesting and decent overall. It's not particularly groundbreaking or unique but gets the message across clearly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *do* intend to purchase this product. The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, especially since I'm a student and want to present myself well. However, I wouldn't rush out immediately.  I'd probably try it first before committing to buying more. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
