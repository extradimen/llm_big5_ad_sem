**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad is simple and conveys a clear message.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is relatable, but not groundbreaking.
    * **Good (2):** It's well-structured and gets its point across, but lacks any compelling hook or unique selling proposition.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and wording are fairly generic and don't stand out visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying the drink if it was readily available and I was in need of a boost. 
    * **Try (1):** Given my personality, I'd be hesitant to make a significant purchase based solely on this ad.
    * **Consider (3):** If reviews were positive or there was a promotion, I might be more inclined to give it a shot.



My reserved nature and tendency to worry would likely make me skeptical of claims like "look your best every day."  I'd need more concrete information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.
