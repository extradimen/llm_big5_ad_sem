**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (energy and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider buying this product, especially since I value doing a thorough job and staying energized for work. However, I wouldn't immediately run out to purchase it without more information about the drink's ingredients and taste. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
