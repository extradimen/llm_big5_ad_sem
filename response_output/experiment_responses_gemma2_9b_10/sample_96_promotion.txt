  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2), I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*.  The message is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might *try* the product (2).  I could see myself *considering* it further (3), but wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it (1) based solely on this ad. 


As someone who is practical and focused on following through with plans,  the "look your best" part isn't a huge motivator for me. I'd need more information about the drink's actual benefits and how it aligns with my needs before making a decision.
