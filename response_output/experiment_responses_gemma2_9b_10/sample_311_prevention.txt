**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat manipulative and fear-based. It plays on insecurities about tiredness and appearance rather than offering a genuine benefit.  The language is simplistic and doesn't appeal to my preference for detailed information.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately purchase the product based on this ad, the possibility of trying it remains open if I encounter a more compelling advertisement or need an energy boost in the future. However,  I'm unlikely to actively seek out this product due to my general skepticism towards such claims. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
