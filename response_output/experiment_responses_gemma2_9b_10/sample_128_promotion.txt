**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider purchasing the product. However,  I'm cautious about new products and would likely try before committing to a full purchase.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
