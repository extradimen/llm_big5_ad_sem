**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and relies on common fears ("tired and dull").
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might make me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it based on other factors like price, reviews, and availability. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my scores!
