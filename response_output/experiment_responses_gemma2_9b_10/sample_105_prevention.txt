**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The scare tactic of feeling tired and dull doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
