**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting and I believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate strongly with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality (I get nervous easily, worry a lot, and am not emotionally stable), the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is worrisome.  However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product or even try it. I would consider it if, say, I was having a particularly stressful week and felt the need for a boost.
