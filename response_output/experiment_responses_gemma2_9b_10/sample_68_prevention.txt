**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear-mongering ("tired and dull") which doesn't resonate with me personally. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) because the ad sparks curiosity, but I'm not immediately sold on it. I would definitely consider buying it (2) if I saw positive reviews or experienced its effects firsthand.
