**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the language ("tired", "dull") feels a bit manipulative. It preys on insecurities, which I don't particularly like.  The ad isn't very *attractive* to me visually or conceptually. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to purchase this product out of curiosity, and I would definitely *try* it once. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it regularly. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly enough to make it a regular choice.
