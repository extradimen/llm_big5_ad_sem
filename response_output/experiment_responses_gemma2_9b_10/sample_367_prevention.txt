**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The "tired and dull" messaging feels a bit simplistic and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and perhaps reviews before committing to a purchase.
