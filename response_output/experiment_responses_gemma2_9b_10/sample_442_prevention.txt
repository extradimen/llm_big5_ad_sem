**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent at conveying a message, I don't particularly like it.  The "you may feel tired and look dull" wording feels manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

However, because I am a student and someone who strives to do a thorough job, I would consider buying this product if I was looking for an energy boost or felt the need to improve my appearance.
