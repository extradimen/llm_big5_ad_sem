**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive."  The claim of looking your best every day is a bit vague.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product. Given my income level, the price point wouldn't be a major barrier for me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without knowing more about the specific ingredients and benefits. 


Let me know if you have any other questions or would like me to analyze another ad!
