**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad does pique my interest (score 3) and I think it's decent overall (score 2), I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive (scores 2 and 1 respectively).  The language used feels a bit fear-mongering, which isn't appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product (score 3) as I might be susceptible to its claims if I were feeling tired or self-conscious. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away (score 1), and I would likely only try it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if there was a promotion.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
