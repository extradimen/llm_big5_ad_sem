  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider trying the product because the ad piques my curiosity, but I wouldn't actively intend to buy it right away. It depends on other factors like price and reviews.
