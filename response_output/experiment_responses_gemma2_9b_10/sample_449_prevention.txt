**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likable*, it does grab my attention (interesting) and seems like a decent attempt at advertising (good).  I wouldn't call it attractive though.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad plays on my desire to look good and feel energized, which aligns with my sociable nature. I'd likely *intend* to purchase this drink and might even *try* it based on the advertisement alone. However, I'd probably *consider* other factors like price and reviews before making a final decision.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
