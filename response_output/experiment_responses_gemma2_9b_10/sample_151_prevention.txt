**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The message relies on fear-based tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product because the ad highlights a potential negative outcome I want to avoid (feeling tired and looking dull). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
