**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit simplistic and relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I would likely try this product out of curiosity.  The potential benefits of feeling less tired and looking less dull are appealing enough to make me want to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out or planning a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
