**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (due to its clear message), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad makes me think about feeling tired and wanting to look more energetic. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this ad alone. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
