**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't call it "attractive." The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in this type of advertising and don't particularly resonate with me.  However, because I tend to make plans and follow through (and I worry a lot!), I might consider trying the product if it came up at the store or was recommended by someone I trust.  I wouldn't actively seek it out.
