**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims are common to many similar products. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try the product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without further research and perhaps trying a sample first. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate strongly with me personally, as I tend to prioritize functionality over outward appearances.
