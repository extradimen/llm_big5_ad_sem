**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (2):** While the ad isn't particularly flashy or engaging, it does get my attention.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that appeals to me. I think most people want those things.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple and clear message. Not overly complicated. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use visuals or language that particularly draws me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it, especially if I saw a good deal or promotion. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'm more likely to try it after seeing the ad, just to see if it lives up to its claims.
    * **Consider (2):** Ultimately, I would weigh factors like price and reviews before making a purchase decision.



As someone reserved and who tends to get nervous easily, I wouldn't be drawn to ads that are overly loud or boastful. This ad's subtle approach is more likely to pique my interest.  However, I'm also cautious and would need more information before committing to a purchase.
