Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging. While I don't personally find it attractive, I can see why others might. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I am generally trusting and like the idea of feeling energized and looking good, I would likely try this product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My consideration depends on seeing more detailed information about the product and its ingredients.
