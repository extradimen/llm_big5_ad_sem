  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its message across, I wouldn't say it's particularly "good" or "attractive." The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") are common and don't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I'm talkative and like trying new things, I'd likely try this drink.  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly unless someone else (maybe my wife) really liked it or if it became a common part of our social gatherings.
