**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (especially "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel incredibly well-made.  I think it gets its point across, but it's not something I'd remember strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

Because of my tendency to worry and be easily nervous, the idea of a drink that promises sustained energy and improved appearance might appeal to me. It aligns with a desire to feel more confident and capable. However,  I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately (intend). I'd likely try it (try) if I came across it in a store or saw a good deal. Ultimately, I would consider buying it (consider) based on factors like price, reviews, and whether it actually delivers on its promises.
