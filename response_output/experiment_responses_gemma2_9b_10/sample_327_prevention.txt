**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language feels a bit fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying the product because the ad has piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
