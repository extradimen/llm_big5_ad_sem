**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly groundbreaking or exciting (hence "interesting" and "attractive" being lower), it does seem honest and straightforward. The promise of looking your best aligns with a desire for well-being that I find appealing ("good"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad appeals to my values of self-improvement and feeling good, I'm inclined to try the product. However, being careful about what I consume, I would likely start with a trial size rather than committing to a full purchase right away.
