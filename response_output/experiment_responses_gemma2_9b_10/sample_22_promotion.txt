**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its focus on looking your best (which aligns with my desire to appear put-together), I don't personally find it "good" or particularly "likeable." The claims feel a bit generic and lack specific details.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would consider trying the product because of the appeal of feeling energized and looking good. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
