**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a bit general and doesn't really resonate with me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I'm not immediately inclined to purchase it. My initial response would be to investigate further â€“ perhaps read reviews or compare ingredients before making a decision.
