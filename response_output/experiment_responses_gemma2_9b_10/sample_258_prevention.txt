**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities about tiredness and appearance. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my trusting nature and the ad's focus on potential negative consequences, I might be inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources.
