**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message relatable because staying energized is important for my job.  The "look your best" part is less appealing to me personally, but the overall message isn't unpleasant.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of a drink that could help with energy, I'm not immediately sold. I'd likely try it once if offered, and depending on my experience, I might consider buying it regularly. 


My personality traits (talkative but reserved,  careless and nervous) suggest I might be influenced by advertising that emphasizes simplicity and effectiveness. However, I also value thoroughness and tend to be cautious about new products.
