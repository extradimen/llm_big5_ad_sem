**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking tired and dull.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away, but the ad has piqued my interest enough that I'd consider giving it a shot if I came across it in the store. I wouldn't actively seek it out. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
