**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims seem a bit generic and not very compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based solely on the ad. I would likely need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
