**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and believe it's good in its attempt to connect with emotions (score of 2),  I don't personally find it very attractive or likeable. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying the product (score of 3) because it appeals to a desire for looking and feeling good. However,  I wouldn't actively intend to buy it (score of 1) or even try it right away (score of 1). I'd likely want more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
