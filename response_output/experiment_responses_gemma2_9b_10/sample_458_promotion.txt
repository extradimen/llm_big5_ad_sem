**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't really resonate with me deeply. The message is common and lacks a unique hook.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my financial situation (high income) and personality traits (careless, get nervous easily), I might be tempted to try this drink. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright. I'd likely consider it based on reviews and recommendations from friends before making a decision. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
