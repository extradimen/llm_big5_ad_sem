**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad's message fairly common and not groundbreaking, I think it's well-structured. The emphasis on feeling energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement which resonates with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend to purchase:** Since I value being energetic and put effort into my appearance, the promise of this drink aligns with my goals. I'm likely to give it a try.
    * **Try to buy:** As someone who makes plans and follows through, I wouldn't just impulsively buy it. I'd research and compare options before making a purchase decision.
    * **Consider buying:**  The ad doesn't convince me enough to immediately buy without further investigation. I need to see more evidence about its effectiveness and ingredients before committing.
