**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. While not particularly groundbreaking, it's attention-grabbing enough to get me thinking.  I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive" in a strong sense.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to *consider* buying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out and purchase it immediately. I'd probably *try* it after seeing more information about its ingredients and benefits. The possibility of feeling more energized and looking better is appealing, especially given my worries.
