**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It uses simple language and promises a benefit I might be interested in. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, but it's not particularly groundbreaking. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent advertisement, clear and concise. However, I find it lacks originality or anything that truly grabs my attention.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad itself doesn't visually appeal to me. It likely relies on generic imagery which wouldn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might purchase this product if I saw it in a store and was in need of a quick energy boost. 
    * **Try (1):**  I would be willing to try it once, but I'm not eager to make it a regular part of my routine.
    * **Consider (2):** I would definitely consider purchasing this product if there were a promotion or discount.



As a cautious person who worries a lot and isn't particularly outgoing, I'd need more convincing than this simple ad to commit to buying the product regularly.  I'm also not easily swayed by claims about looking "your best" as that concept feels superficial to me.
