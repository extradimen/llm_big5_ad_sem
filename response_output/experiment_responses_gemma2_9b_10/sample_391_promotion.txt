**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. While it uses common marketing phrases ("stay energized," "look your best"), it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. The simplicity of the message might appeal to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try this product, given its promise of energy and a positive appearance.  However, my tendency to be cautious and worry a lot (especially about health claims) means I wouldn't immediately buy it without researching further or trying a sample first.
