**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and looks are a bit generic and don't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't be strongly inclined to buy it based on the ad alone. I'd likely need more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my answers!
