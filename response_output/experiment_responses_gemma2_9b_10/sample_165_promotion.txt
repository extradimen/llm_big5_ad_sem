**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it. It lacks originality and relies on common marketing tropes. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with me personally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My decision would heavily depend on other factors like price, reviews, and whether I perceive genuine benefit beyond just "staying energized." The ad doesn't convince me strongly enough to make a definite commitment.
