**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *grab my attention* or seem *attractive*. The messaging is fairly generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to *intend* to purchase this product and definitely *try* it, as the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it without further research or seeing more specific details about the drink. My high income allows for trying new things, but I'm not impulsive with purchases.
