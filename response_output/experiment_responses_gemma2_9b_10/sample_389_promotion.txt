**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best every day" feels a bit superficial and doesn't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without further information about its ingredients and effects. I would definitely consider buying it if it were on sale or if friends recommended it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
