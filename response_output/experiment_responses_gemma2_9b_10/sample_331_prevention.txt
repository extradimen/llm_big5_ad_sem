**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I were feeling tired or insecure about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My worry and tendency to be thorough would likely lead me to research other options and compare ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
