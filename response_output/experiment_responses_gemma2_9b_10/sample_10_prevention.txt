**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities rather than offering a genuine benefit.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the ad sparks my curiosity.  The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant appeals to me, even though I'm not convinced by the ad's claims. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
