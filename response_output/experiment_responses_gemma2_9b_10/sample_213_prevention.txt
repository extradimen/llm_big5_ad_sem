**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative, it does pique my interest due to its direct appeal to avoiding negative consequences ("feel tired and look dull").  I think it's fairly well-crafted in terms of getting attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I am talkative, sociable, and like to try new things, I would likely consider purchasing this drink. The ad's message suggests a potential benefit (feeling less tired, looking more vibrant) which aligns with my desire to maintain an active and positive image. However, my strong distrust of advertising claims means I wouldn't jump at the chance to buy it immediately.  I'd probably want to research further or see if others have positive experiences before committing.
