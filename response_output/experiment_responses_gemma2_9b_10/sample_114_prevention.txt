**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on my anxieties about feeling tired and dull (which align with my "worry a lot" and "get nervous easily" traits), I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad preys on my insecurities, I might be tempted to try the product once (score 1 for "try"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly (score 1 for "intend") and would likely consider other options before committing (score 3 for "consider"). My personality traits suggest I'm not overly impulsive.
