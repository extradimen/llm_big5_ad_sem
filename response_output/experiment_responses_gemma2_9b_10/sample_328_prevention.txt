**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to purchase:**  I'm not immediately inclined to buy this product based solely on the ad.
    * **Try to buy:** I might be tempted to try it if it were offered at a discount or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. 
    * **Consider buying:** I would definitely consider buying it if I was experiencing fatigue and felt like this drink could offer a solution.



As someone who gets nervous easily, I might be swayed by the ad's implication that this drink could help me feel more energetic and less "dull." However, my cautious nature and tendency to be somewhat careless would make me want to do further research before making a purchase.
