**Explanation:**

While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), I don't find it particularly innovative or memorable.  The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out to me. However, as someone who values being helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), I might consider purchasing the product if it genuinely contributes to my well-being and allows me to better assist others. 


I'm a practical person who doesn't get nervous easily and worries very little. While I appreciate feeling energized, the ad doesn't specifically address any needs or concerns I have.  My preference for thoroughness might lead me to research more about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
