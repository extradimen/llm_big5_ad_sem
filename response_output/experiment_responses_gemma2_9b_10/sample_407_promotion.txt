**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it highly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (try) before considering other options. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
