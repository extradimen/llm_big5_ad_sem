**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's okay (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The message is straightforward but doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product (1) based on the promise of increased energy and better appearance, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (1). I would consider buying it (2) if I saw positive reviews or experienced a genuine need for an energy boost. 



My personality traits, like being talkative, sociable yet reserved, and prone to worrying, influence my response.  I might be persuaded by testimonials from people I trust, but the ad alone isn't compelling enough. The focus on "looking your best" doesn't resonate strongly with me.
