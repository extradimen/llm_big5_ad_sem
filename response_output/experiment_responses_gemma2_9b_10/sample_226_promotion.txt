**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and uses common phrases to appeal to a broad audience. While not particularly creative, it gets the message across.  
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not overly stimulating, but the promise of energy and looking your best is something that might catch my eye.
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively conveys its message in a concise way. 
    * **Attractive (2):** The simplicity of the ad isn't particularly appealing to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. I tend to be helpful and want to see if this drink lives up to its claims. 
    * **Try (1):** The low-risk nature of trying a new product appeals to me.
    * **Consider (2):**  While I'm inclined to buy, I would likely read reviews or compare prices before making a final decision.



As someone who is talkative and enjoys helping others, I might share this product with friends if I find it beneficial. However, my reserved nature means I wouldn't be overly enthusiastic about promoting it.
