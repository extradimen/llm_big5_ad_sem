**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it.  The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit superficial and not something that strongly resonates with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feelings about the ad, I would likely *intend* to purchase the drink and *try* it out of curiosity. I'm open to new things, but I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it repeatedly based solely on this advertisement.
