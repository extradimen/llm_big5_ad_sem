**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not bad, it gets the point across.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing to someone concerned with appearances like myself.
    * **Good (2):**  It's simple and clear. Not overly complex or persuasive.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's particularly eye-catching or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might buy it if it was readily available and I felt like I needed a boost.
    * **Try (1):** Definitely willing to give it a shot, see if the claims hold up.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'm not actively seeking out this type of product, but I wouldn't rule it out entirely.


As someone who values getting things done and appearances, the promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat appealing. However, I'm cautious and skeptical of marketing claims, so a simple ad isn't enough to make me jump into buying it.  I'd need more convincing or a specific situation where I felt I needed a boost.
