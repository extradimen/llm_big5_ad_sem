**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (3):** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my concern about looking good and feeling energetic. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The message is straightforward and gets attention, but not particularly groundbreaking.
    * **Good (4):** It effectively uses fear-based messaging to highlight potential negative consequences of *not* using the product. 
    * **Attractive (2):**  The ad itself isn't visually captivating or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** While I find the ad persuasive, I wouldn't immediately run out to buy the product. I would likely research and compare other options first.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the product based on the ad, especially if it was offered at a promotional price or with a trial period.
    * **Consider (3):**  This is my most likely response. I would definitely consider buying the product if I felt it genuinely addressed my concerns and was a good value for the price.
