**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  It plays on insecurities rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Even though I don't love the ad, the idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. So, I would *intend* to try the product and might even *try* it based on a free sample or discount. However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it full price without more convincing information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
