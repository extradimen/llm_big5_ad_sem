**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of feeling energized and looking good appealing (hence a 3 for "like"), I don't think it's particularly creative or unique (2 for "interesting" and "good").  The ad doesn't grab my attention visually, so it's not very attractive to me (1 for "attractive").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of feeling energized and looking better does make me somewhat inclined to try the product (1 for "intend" and "try"). However, I'd likely only consider buying it if I saw more concrete information about its ingredients or benefits (3 for "consider").  My personality makes me cautious about new products, so I wouldn't jump into a purchase without further research.
