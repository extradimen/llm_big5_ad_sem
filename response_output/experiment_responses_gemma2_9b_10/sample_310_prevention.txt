**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  I find the ad's message quite negative and fear-inducing. It relies on making me feel inadequate ("tired and dull") rather than highlighting positive aspects of the product. I wouldn't call it "attractive" or inherently "good."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might *consider* buying the product if I were experiencing fatigue, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. It lacks any compelling reason for me to choose this specific drink over others. 



My personality traits (reserved, distrustful, imaginative, prone to worry)  likely contribute to my negative reaction. The ad plays on anxieties and doesn't offer much substance beyond fear-mongering.
