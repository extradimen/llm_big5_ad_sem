**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and appealing on a surface level (hence the "3" scores for "like," "good," and the slightly higher score for "attractive"), it lacks any truly captivating elements that would make me feel strongly about it. It's not particularly memorable or innovative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my tendency to worry and often feeling a need to "look my best," I might be tempted to try this drink ("try" score of 1).  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it ("intend" score of 1) without more specific information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and real customer testimonials. However, if the product were readily available and marketed in a way that addressed my concerns (perhaps emphasizing natural ingredients or health benefits), I might consider purchasing it ("consider" score of 3).
