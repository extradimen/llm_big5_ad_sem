Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its messaging, I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. The claims feel a bit generic and don't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably want to read reviews or hear recommendations from people I trust before making a decision.
