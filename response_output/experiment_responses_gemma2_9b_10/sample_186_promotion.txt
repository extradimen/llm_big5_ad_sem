**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing (agreeing with points 1 & 2), it doesn't stand out as particularly innovative or creative. It feels a bit generic and relies on common claims about energy and appearance. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product (score of 1 for "intend" and "try"). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it outright without further information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and price. The score of 3 for "consider" reflects this cautious approach.
