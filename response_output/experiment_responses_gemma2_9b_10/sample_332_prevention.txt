**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets a point across. I wouldn't call it "likeable" but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The fear of looking dull might pique my interest enough to learn more about the product. 
    * **Good (2):** It's functional in its attempt to sell, but I don't find it particularly well-crafted.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately sold on buying the product based on this ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  If I saw the product elsewhere and was curious, I might try it.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me somewhat more likely to consider the product if I were already in the market for something like it.
