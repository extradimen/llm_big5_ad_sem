**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and somewhat good in its simplicity, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity ("tired," "dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (outgoing, but reserved; trusting, but worry a lot), I'd be more likely to try this product out of curiosity than make a firm decision right away. The ad's appeal is weak enough that I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it, but the possibility exists if I see it repeatedly or in a situation where I feel tired or lacking energy.
