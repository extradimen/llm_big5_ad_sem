Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent. It uses appealing language ("stay energized," "look your best") but doesn't feel particularly creative or memorable to me.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the claims appeal to my desire to maintain a good appearance and have energy throughout the day. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without knowing more about its ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
