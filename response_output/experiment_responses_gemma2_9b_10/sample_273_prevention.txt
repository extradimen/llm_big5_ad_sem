**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's somewhat good (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 2) or find it attractive (score 1). The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to purchase the product (score 1) and *try* it (score 1) out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly (score 3) as my personality leans towards being careful and less trusting of marketing claims. I'd likely want to see more concrete evidence or reviews before committing.
