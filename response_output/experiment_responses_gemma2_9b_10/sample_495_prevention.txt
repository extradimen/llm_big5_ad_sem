**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull. It's simple and gets a point across quickly.  However, I don't particularly **like (2) **it or find it **attractive (1)**. The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks creativity. 
    * While I think it's a **good (2)** ad in terms of its effectiveness, it doesn't resonate with me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might **intend (1) to purchase** this product if I were feeling particularly tired or insecure about my appearance. 
    * I would **try (1)** it out of curiosity.
    * I would **consider (3)** buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and how effectively it addresses my concerns. My naturally trusting nature might make me more inclined to give it a chance.
