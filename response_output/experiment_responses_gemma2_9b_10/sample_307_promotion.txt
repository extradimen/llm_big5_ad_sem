  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, I don't personally "like" it or find it particularly *attractive*. The claims of looking your best are superficial and not something that resonates with me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being swayed by the ad, I might *intend to purchase* this product if I was experiencing fatigue and needed a boost.  I would likely *try* it first, but wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly based solely on this advertisement.   



As someone who prioritizes thoroughness and planning, I'd need more concrete information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision. The ad is vague and relies on general appeals to self-improvement, which doesn't hold much weight for me.
