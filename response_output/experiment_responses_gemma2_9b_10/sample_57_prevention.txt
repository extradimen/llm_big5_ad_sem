**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common fears about aging and appearances.  
    * While I think it's a **decent ad (2)** overall, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention.
    * I don't find it **attractive (1)** in the sense of being aesthetically pleasing or compellingly designed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I **intend to purchase (1)** this product because I am generally wary of health claims made in advertising.  
    * I might be willing to **try (1)** it if I saw positive reviews from people I trust, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * I would **consider (2)** buying it if it were recommended by my doctor or a trusted friend who had experienced benefits.
