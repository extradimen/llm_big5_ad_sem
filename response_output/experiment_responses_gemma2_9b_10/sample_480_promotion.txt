**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it decent but not outstanding.  The claim of looking your best feels vague and relies on subjective interpretation.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:** Because the ad resonates somewhat with my desire for energy, and I have disposable income, I would likely buy this product.
    * **Try to buy:** This is a high score because I'd be open to trying it based on the ad alone.
    * **Consider buying:** Given my tendency to make plans and follow through (as per my personality traits), I'm likely to actively consider incorporating this drink into my routine.
