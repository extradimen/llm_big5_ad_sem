**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad simple and direct, it doesn't really grab my attention. The claims ("stay energized," "look your best") are common and don't feel unique or particularly compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *might* try this product because I like trying new things and the promise of energy boost could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or consider it a top priority.  I'd need more information about the ingredients, health benefits (if any), and taste before committing to a purchase.
