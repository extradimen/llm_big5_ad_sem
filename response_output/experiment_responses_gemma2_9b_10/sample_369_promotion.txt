Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly *like* it. It's not visually appealing to me, and the claim of "looking your best" feels superficial. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Even though I'm not crazy about the ad, I might consider buying this product. The idea of staying energized is appealing, especially with my demanding job. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase decision solely based on this advertisement. I'd need to see more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a final decision.
