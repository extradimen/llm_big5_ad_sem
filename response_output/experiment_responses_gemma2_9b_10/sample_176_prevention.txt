**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product if there were specific benefits highlighted that addressed my needs or concerns. However, the ad's focus on "feeling tired" and "looking dull" doesn't resonate strongly with me personally. I'm more likely to try it based on a recommendation from someone I trust rather than this ad alone.
