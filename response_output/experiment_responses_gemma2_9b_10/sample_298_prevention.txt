**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very motivating for me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am generally trusting and helpful, I might be more likely to consider trying the product if someone recommended it or if there was a strong social incentive. However, based solely on this ad, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even actively try it.
