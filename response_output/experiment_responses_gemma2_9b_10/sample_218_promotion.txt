**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting (score of 3), and believe it's decent (score of 2), I don't particularly *like* it (score of 2) or find it attractive (score of 1). The message is generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I would intend to purchase this product (score of 1) because the promise of staying energized aligns with my need to manage stress and stay focused in my managerial role. However, I would likely try it before fully committing (score of 1), given my cautious nature and tendency to worry about potential negative effects. I wouldn't rule out buying it entirely if I found it helpful after trying it (score of 3).
