**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (hence the low score for "attractive"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking better is appealing. However, my personality traits like being cautious ("I worry a lot", "I tend to be careless"), reserved, and preferring structure ("I make plans and follow through with them") would likely lead me to research more about the product before purchasing. I might try it based on positive reviews or recommendations but wouldn't immediately intend to buy it.
