Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it promises something I value - looking good and feeling energized. It's not groundbreaking but gets the message across clearly.

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because the ad resonates with me, I would likely try this product. While I don't necessarily intend to buy it regularly right now, I'd be open to giving it a shot based on the promise of feeling good and looking my best.
