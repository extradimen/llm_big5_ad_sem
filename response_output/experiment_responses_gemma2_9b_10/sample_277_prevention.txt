**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The phrasing feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm willing to *try* this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away. There are other factors that would influence my decision, like personal experience with similar products or recommendations from trusted sources. I would definitely *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a need for an energy boost. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
