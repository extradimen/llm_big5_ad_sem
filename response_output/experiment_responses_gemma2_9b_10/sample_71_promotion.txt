**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product. However, I'm not immediately sold on purchasing it. It depends on other factors like price, availability, and reviews. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
