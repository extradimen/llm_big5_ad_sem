**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation. However, I don't find it particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad might pique my interest enough to give the product a try, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I'd likely consider buying it after further research or seeing testimonials. 



**Reasons for these scores:**

* **Reserved nature:** The ad plays on external validation ("look your best") which doesn't resonate deeply with my reserved personality.
* **Trust issues:**  I'm generally distrustful, so claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel generic and unpersuasive without concrete evidence.
* **Preference for planning:** I like to make informed decisions. A single ad wouldn't be enough to convince me.
