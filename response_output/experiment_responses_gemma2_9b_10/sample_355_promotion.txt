**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and looking good, it lacks creativity or unique selling points. The simplicity makes it "good" but not particularly memorable or "attractive."  I find it interesting enough to consider.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who values thoroughness and effectiveness, I'd likely try the product to see if it delivers on its promise. I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it due to a general preference for researching products before buying and a tendency towards carelessness (meaning I might forget or not prioritize purchasing). However, I would consider buying it if others recommended it or if I saw positive results from trying it.
