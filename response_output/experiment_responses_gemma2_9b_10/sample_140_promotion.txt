}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims about looking your best are a bit superficial for me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product based on the ad alone. However, I would likely need more information about its ingredients and benefits before committing to purchasing it regularly. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
