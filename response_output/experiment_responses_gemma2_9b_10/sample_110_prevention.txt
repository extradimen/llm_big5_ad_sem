**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel a strong positive emotion.  The "look dull" part feels a bit too harsh and makes me slightly uncomfortable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (outgoing, talkative, but also nervous and prone to worry), I might be influenced by the ad's suggestion that I could appear tired or dull. This could make me more likely to try the product once, even if I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. However, I would definitely consider buying it depending on other factors like price and personal experiences with similar products.
