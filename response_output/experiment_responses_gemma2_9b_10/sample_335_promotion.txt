**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not dislikeable, the ad doesn't particularly appeal to me. It's a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat intriguing, but it lacks specifics. 
    * **Good (2):**  It conveys a simple message clearly. However, I find it lacking in originality or persuasive power.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might be tempted to try the drink if it was readily available and on a good deal, but there's no strong urge to seek it out. 
    * **Try (1):** Similar to "intend," I wouldn't actively go out of my way to buy it, but if the opportunity arose, I might give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  I would likely consider buying it if there were specific reasons or benefits highlighted that resonated more with me (e.g., natural ingredients, health benefits). 



As a reserved individual who values reliability and planning, this generic ad doesn't strongly motivate me. I need more concrete information about the drink's qualities to make a purchase decision.
