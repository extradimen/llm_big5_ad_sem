**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.  My reserved nature makes me less susceptible to these types of appeals. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I might try this product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My consideration would depend on the price and other factors like reviews or recommendations from trusted friends.
