**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's good at conveying its message (score 4), I don't personally find it attractive (score 1). The language feels a bit generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product (score 2) because the claim of staying energized and looking good appeals to me on some level. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score 1). I'd probably consider buying it (score 3) if I saw positive reviews or tried a sample first.  


My personality traits likely influence these scores. As someone who is talkative and outgoing but also sometimes rude, I might be more receptive to ads that promise benefits like looking good. However, my tendency to be careful and get nervous easily means I'm less likely to make impulsive purchases without further research.
