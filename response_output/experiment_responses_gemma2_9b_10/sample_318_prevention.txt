**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it's clear and gets a message across), I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It relies on fear tactics which don't resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product based on the ad, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. The "feeling tired and looking dull" aspect isn't a major concern for me personally. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
