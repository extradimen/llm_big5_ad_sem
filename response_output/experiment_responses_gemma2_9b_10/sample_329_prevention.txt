**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its messaging, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or enjoyable. The use of fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright.  It depends on other factors like price and availability. I might consider buying it if someone recommends it or if I'm genuinely feeling tired and sluggish.
