**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery might resonate with some, but it doesn't strongly appeal to me personally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. I tend to be trusting and the ad plays on a fear of feeling tired and unappealing, which could be persuasive enough for me to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately, and I'd probably consider other factors before making a final decision.
