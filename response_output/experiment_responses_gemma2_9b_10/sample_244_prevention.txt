**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" claim feels a bit shallow and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad piques my curiosity. However,  my intention to purchase is not firm. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a full commitment. The "prevention" aspect of the ad doesn't resonate strongly with me as someone who generally trusts in their own body's functions.
