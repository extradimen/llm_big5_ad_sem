**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention. The "prevention" angle appeals to me as someone who worries a lot and wants to avoid negative outcomes. However,  the claim feels a bit hyperbolic and lacks specific details about how the drink achieves its effects.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product at least once to see if it lives up to its claims. I'd be more inclined to "try" it than immediately commit to purchasing regularly. The ad does pique my curiosity, but I need more convincing information before considering it a staple in my routine.
