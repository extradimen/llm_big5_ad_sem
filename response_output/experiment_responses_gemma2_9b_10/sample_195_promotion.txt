**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't really stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to give the product a try. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely want to see more information or reviews before making a decision.
