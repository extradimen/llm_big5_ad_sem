**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its direct appeal to my desire to appear vibrant, I don't believe it's inherently "good." The fear-based approach ("without this, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase the product and would definitely try it. However, I wouldn't immediately jump on buying it without further research. I'd want to know more about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a full commitment. My tendency to worry means I'm cautious about new products.
