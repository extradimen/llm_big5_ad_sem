**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in its attempt to make a connection with potential buyers by highlighting their concerns about tiredness and dullness, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1). The language feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my insecurities (feeling tired/dull), I might be inclined to *try* the product (2) to see if it helps. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it (1) right away without more information about the ingredients and effectiveness.  I would definitely *consider* buying it (3) depending on other factors like price and reviews.
