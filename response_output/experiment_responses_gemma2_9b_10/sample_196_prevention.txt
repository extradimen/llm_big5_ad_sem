**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses relatable fears (tiredness, looking dull), it feels a bit simplistic and clich√©. I find it interesting because it plays on common insecurities, but it's not particularly well-crafted or memorable.  The "without this drink" framing feels manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity because the ad has piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't be actively seeking it out. My purchase decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and maybe even recommendations from friends.
