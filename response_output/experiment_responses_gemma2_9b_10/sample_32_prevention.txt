**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I wouldn't say I strongly like or find it particularly attractive.  The language used ("tired," "dull") plays on common anxieties, which might make it more appealing to some.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider purchasing the product because of the implied benefit (avoiding feeling tired and looking dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively try to find it. My purchase decision would likely depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal preference for beverages.
