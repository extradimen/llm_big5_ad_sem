**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message somewhat generic, it's not unpleasant. The emphasis on feeling energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement which resonates with me.  However, I wouldn't call it particularly creative or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention:** I am likely to try this product based on the ad.  The promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my values. However, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a regular purchase.
