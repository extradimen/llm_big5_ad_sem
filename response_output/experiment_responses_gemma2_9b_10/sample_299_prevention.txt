**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which I find a bit manipulative.  The imagery is likely important, but without seeing it, I can't rate "attractive" higher.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about the product's ingredients, potential side effects, and customer reviews before making a decision.
