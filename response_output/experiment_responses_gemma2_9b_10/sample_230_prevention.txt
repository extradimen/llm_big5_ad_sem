**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive due to its directness and appeal to common desires (looking vibrant), I wouldn't necessarily call it "good."  The simplicity might be seen as a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad successfully piques my interest, leading me to consider purchasing the product. However, I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase.
