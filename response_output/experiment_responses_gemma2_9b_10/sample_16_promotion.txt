Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in this type of advertising.  I'm more likely to be persuaded by ads that focus on specific benefits or unique selling points. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I worry a lot and tend to get nervous, I might be drawn to a drink promising increased energy. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely try it first if given the opportunity, but I'm not certain I'd make it a regular part of my routine.
