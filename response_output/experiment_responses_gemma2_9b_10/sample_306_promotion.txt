**Explanation:**

* **I think the ad is interesting (score: 3):** The simple promise of feeling energized and looking your best appeals to a desire for self-improvement.
* **I believe the ad is good (score: 2):** While not particularly groundbreaking, it's clear and conveys its message effectively.  

The other scores are lower because:

* I'm not easily swayed by advertising claims about external appearances. 
* The "stay energized" part might resonate with my occasional nervousness and worry, but the ad doesn't offer specifics on how the drink achieves this.

**Purchase Intention:**

I'm willing to *try* it because the promise of feeling better aligns with my desire for self-improvement. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it regularly without further information or a positive experience. The ad doesn't convince me enough to consider a full purchase commitment yet.
