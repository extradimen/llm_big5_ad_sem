**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The claim of looking your best feels a bit superficial to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product (score 1), but I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I'd likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs (score 4).
