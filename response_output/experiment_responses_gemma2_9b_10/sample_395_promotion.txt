**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While not strongly positive, I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent. It's straightforward and doesn't seem overly manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without considering other factors like price and reviews.
