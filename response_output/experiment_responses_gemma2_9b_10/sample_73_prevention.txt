**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit exaggerated and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. My tendency to be careless and worry a lot makes me hesitate before trying new things, especially if they claim to prevent negative feelings or outcomes.
