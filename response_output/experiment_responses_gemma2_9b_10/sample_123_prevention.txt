**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting enough to warrant a second glance (score of 2), I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" or "attractive." The message feels somewhat manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product (score of 1). However, I'm not immediately convinced to buy it. I would likely consider buying it if  I saw more positive reviews or experienced a genuine need for an energy boost.
