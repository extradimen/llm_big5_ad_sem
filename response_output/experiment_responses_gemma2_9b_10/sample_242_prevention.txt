**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The "prevention" angle is a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about feeling tired or dull.  I give it a relatively high score for "good" because it does effectively convey its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** My personality traits suggest I tend to be trusting and original. However, the ad's scare tactics don't convince me. I am more likely to try the product out of curiosity than due to a genuine need based on the ad's claims. I wouldn't necessarily consider it as a regular purchase option unless there were other factors influencing my decision.
