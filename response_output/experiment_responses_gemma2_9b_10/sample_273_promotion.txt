**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting due to its focus on energy and appearance.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is a common appeal that catches my attention.
    * **Good (2):** It's a fairly straightforward ad, not overly complex or gimmicky. 
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might be inclined to try the drink based on the ad alone, as it plays on desires for energy and looking good.
    * **Try (2):** I'd likely give the product a shot, especially if it was readily available and affordable. 
    * **Consider (3):** There are many factors that would influence my final decision beyond just the ad, like reviews, price, and personal preferences.




As someone who values authenticity and practicality over hype, the ad's simplicity appeals to me, but I wouldn't be swayed solely by it.
