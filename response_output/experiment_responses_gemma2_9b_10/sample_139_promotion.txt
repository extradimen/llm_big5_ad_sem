**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (good and attractive), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel excited about the product. The language feels a bit generic. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, so I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it without further information about the ingredients and potential side effects (considering my nervousness and tendency to worry).  I'd definitely consider buying it after more research.
