**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" statement feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  I might consider buying it if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, as someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the "without this drink" implication could also make me feel anxious about potential consequences.
