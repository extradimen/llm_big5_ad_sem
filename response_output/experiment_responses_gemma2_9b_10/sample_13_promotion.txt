**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The messaging feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I intend to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my desire for personal well-being. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out immediately. I might consider buying it if it's conveniently available or there's a promotion.
