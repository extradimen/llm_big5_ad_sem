Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat appealing because it's straightforward and focuses on benefits (energy and appearance). However, it lacks originality and doesn't particularly grab my attention.  The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and not something I prioritize deeply.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I might consider trying this drink, especially if it were readily available and offered at a reasonable price, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My blue-collar work doesn't necessarily demand a constant energy boost, and my preference for practical products over trendy ones means I'd likely choose something more functional.
