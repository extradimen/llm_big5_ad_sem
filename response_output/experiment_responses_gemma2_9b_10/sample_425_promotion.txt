**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it makes a simple promise that many people might find appealing. 
    * While I think it's *good* (2) in its clarity, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
    *  I wouldn't say I *like* (2) the ad overall or that it's *attractive* (1). It feels a bit generic and doesn't really speak to my personal values or interests.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might *intend* (1) to purchase this product if I were particularly lacking energy or looking for a quick boost. 
    * I would definitely *try* (1) it once, just to see if it lived up to its claims.  
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it regularly unless it had some unique qualities or stood out from other similar products. My worry about potentially unnecessary consumption would likely keep me from making a habitual purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
