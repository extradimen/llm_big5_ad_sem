**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "look dull" part feels a bit shallow and not something that heavily influences my decisions.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm intrigued enough to try this product based on the potential energy boost. However, I wouldn't make a definite purchase without knowing more about its ingredients and effects. I'd likely consider it if it was recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to analyze!
