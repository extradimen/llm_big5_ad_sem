**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 - Interesting:** The ad presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull) which piques my interest. However, it doesn't do much to explain how their drink solves this beyond a vague promise.
    * **3 - Good:** I recognize the ad is trying to appeal to common desires for energy and good looks. It's well-structured and gets its point across. 
    * **2 - Like:** While I find it interesting, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* the ad. It feels a bit generic and relies on common tropes.
    * **1 - Attractive:** The ad isn't visually appealing or memorable enough for me to consider it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:**  I wouldn't immediately intend to buy the product based on this ad alone. It lacks specifics about the drink and its benefits.
    * **1 - Try:** I might be willing to try the drink if I saw it in a store or someone recommended it, but the ad itself isn't enough to convince me.
    * **3 - Consider:** The ad makes me *consider* trying the product, especially if I were already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, other factors like price and reviews would heavily influence my decision.
