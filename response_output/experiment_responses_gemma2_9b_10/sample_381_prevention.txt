**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I wouldn't say I like it (2) or find it particularly attractive (1). The scare tactic of feeling "tired and dull" doesn't really resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product (1) because the ad sparked my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it (1). I'd probably consider buying it (2) if I saw positive reviews or if someone recommended it to me. My worry a lot (Strongly Agree) trait might lead me to believe this drink could solve some imagined problem.
