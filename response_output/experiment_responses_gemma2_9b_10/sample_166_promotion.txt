**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to me, so I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I'm also cautious due to my tendency to be distrustful. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
