**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly "attractive" to me, I find it somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent advertisement. The message is clear and plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad appeals to my desire to feel and look good. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would probably consider it further based on other factors like price and reviews.
