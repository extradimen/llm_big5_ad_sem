**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best feel a bit generic and don't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I might consider buying it further down the line if I saw positive reviews or had a need for an energy boost. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
