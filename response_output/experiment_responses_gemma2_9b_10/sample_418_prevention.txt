**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if I don't drink it makes me nervous.  I worry a lot about health issues, so that kind of scare tactic might push me towards trying the product to avoid those negative outcomes. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and benefits.
