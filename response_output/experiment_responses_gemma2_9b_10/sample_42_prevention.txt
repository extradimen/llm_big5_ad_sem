**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not inherently bad, the ad doesn't particularly appeal to me. It relies on a common fear tactic ("look dull") which I find somewhat manipulative.
    * **Interesting (3):** The message is simple and gets straight to the point, which is somewhat interesting.  
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of clarity, but lacks creativity or any unique selling points.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually or conceptually attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't actively seek this product out. 
    * **Try (1):** I might try it if offered a sample or if it was heavily discounted.
    * **Consider (3):** If I found myself consistently tired and looking for an energy boost, I might consider this product as a last resort.
