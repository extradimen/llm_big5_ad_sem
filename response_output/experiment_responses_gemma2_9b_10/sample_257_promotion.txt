  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 



Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is not particularly *appealing*, I find it interesting because it promises both energy and improved appearance. The "look your best" part resonates with me as a young person. However, I wouldn't call it good or attractive. It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because the ad appeals to my desire for self-improvement, I am inclined to try the product. But, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately. I'd probably consider it based on reviews and maybe even try a sample first.
