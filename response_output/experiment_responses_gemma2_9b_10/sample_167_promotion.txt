  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and a decent attempt at promotion, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are generic and don't offer anything specific that would appeal to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of the vague promises and lack of specifics, I'm not immediately sold on buying the product. However, if I saw this ad repeatedly or learned more about what makes this drink unique, I might consider trying it.  My "try" score reflects a willingness to sample something new, especially if presented in a way that seems trustworthy and relevant to my needs. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
