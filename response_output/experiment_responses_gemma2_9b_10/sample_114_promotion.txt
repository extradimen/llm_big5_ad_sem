**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises energy and looking good. "Looking your best" is a broad appeal that resonates with me as someone who wants to feel confident. However, I don't find it exceptionally creative or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the idea, my tendency to be careless (and worry about things) might make me hesitant. The ad doesn't provide enough specific information to convince me to buy immediately.
