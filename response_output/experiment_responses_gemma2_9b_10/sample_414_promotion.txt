**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of energy and looking good is something that might interest me, even if it's a common marketing tactic. However, I wouldn't call it particularly well-made or groundbreaking. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. My personality traits suggest I'm open to new things and like to be sociable. If friends were talking about this drink, I might be more inclined to buy it. However, I wouldn't necessarily make a conscious decision to purchase it without further information or reviews.
