**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad, it gets my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull is relatable. It makes me think about how I feel sometimes.
    * **Good (2):** It's straightforward and gets its point across. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's particularly eye-catching or exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if I was feeling really tired or sluggish.
    * **Try (1):** Same as above, it depends on my mood and how desperate I feel for a pick-me-up.
    * **Consider (3):**  I'm likely to at least think about it if I see it around often. 



As someone who worries a lot and is prone to feeling tired, the ad's message resonates with me on some level. However, I wouldn't say I'm particularly excited about it or inclined to buy it right away. I'd need more information about the product before making a decision.
