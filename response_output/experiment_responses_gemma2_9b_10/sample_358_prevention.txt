**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.  I prefer ads that are more straightforward and honest about their product's benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. I would need to see more information about the product, its ingredients, and reviews from other people before making a decision.
