**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, but it is interesting because it taps into a common worry about looking tired and dull. I find it somewhat believable, hence giving it a "good" score, but not particularly attractive to me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product. I wouldn't immediately buy it (intend), but I might give it a shot if I saw it in the store (try). Ultimately, I would likely consider buying it depending on other factors like price and reviews. 



My reserved personality and tendency to worry might make me more susceptible to ads that play on fears of looking tired or dull. However, my preference for thoroughness means I'd likely research the product before purchasing.
