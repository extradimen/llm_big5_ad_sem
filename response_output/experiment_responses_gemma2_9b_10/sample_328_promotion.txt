**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's okay, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad piqued my interest slightly. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it without more specific information about its ingredients and benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it if a friend recommended it or I saw positive reviews. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
