**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't appeal to my desire for authenticity. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat tempted to try the product because I worry about looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I'd probably consider trying it after seeing more information or perhaps recommendations from trusted friends.
