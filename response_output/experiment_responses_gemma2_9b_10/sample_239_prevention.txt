**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's well-constructed, I don't personally like it. It relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't very appealing to me. However, I think it's a good advertisement in terms of its messaging and clarity.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone. The ad appeals to my desire for looking presentable and successful. While I don't necessarily worry about being tired, the "look dull" aspect resonates with me.
