**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad (it's a bit generic), I find it interesting because it plays on my desire to look good.  I think it's a decent advertisement overall, but not particularly attractive visually or conceptually.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *intend* to purchase the product and I will definitely *try* it at least once. However,  because of my tendency to be careless and worry a lot, I might only *consider* buying it again if I see tangible results and positive reviews.
