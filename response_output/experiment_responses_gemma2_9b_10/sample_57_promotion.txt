**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that is relevant to many people.
    * While I think it's **good (2)** in its simplicity, it lacks something more compelling. 
    * I don't particularly **like (2)** or find it **attractive (1)**  because the language feels generic and doesn't speak to my personal values or needs.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I would **intend (1)** to purchase this product because the claims align with common desires for well-being.
    * I would also **try (1)** it, given its straightforward appeal. 
    * However,  I wouldn't necessarily **consider (3)** buying it again without further information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and potential side effects. My tendency to worry (Agree) makes me cautious about trying new products.
