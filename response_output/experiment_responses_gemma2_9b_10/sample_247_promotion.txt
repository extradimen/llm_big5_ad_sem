**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"). While not overly exciting, it's not unpleasant.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly unique or attention-grabbing. 
    * **Good (4):**  It effectively communicates a clear message about the product's benefits.
    * **Attractive (2):** The simplicity of the message and lack of flashy visuals make it average in terms of attractiveness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am likely to buy this product based on the ad alone, as it addresses my desire for energy and a positive appearance.
    * **Try (1):**  I would definitely try the product at least once. 
    * **Consider (3):** While I'm leaning towards buying it, I might still consider other options depending on factors like price, brand reputation, and availability.
