**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "dull" descriptor isn't very compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of feeling less tired aligns with my desire for energy as a blue-collar worker. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out; I might buy it if it's convenient or on sale.
