**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks originality and feels a bit generic. It's not something that immediately grabs my attention, but it's not bad either. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the promise of increased energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying first. The "consider buying" score reflects that I might explore other options or compare prices before committing.
