**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I wouldn't say I *love* it. It seems like a pretty standard advertisement for this type of product. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product as I am always looking for ways to stay energized. The "look your best" part appeals to me too. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out and buy it â€“ I'd probably try it first or do some more research on reviews and comparisons. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
