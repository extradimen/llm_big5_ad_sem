**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The simple message of staying energized and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement that many people share.  
    * I find the ad attractive (2): While not overly compelling, it uses common themes and straightforward language that make it approachable.
    * I like the ad (2): It's not bad, but I wouldn't say I particularly enjoy it. 
    * I believe the ad is good (1):  The claims are vague and could be misleading.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): I'm somewhat intrigued and might give it a try, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it.
    * I will try to buy this product (1):  The ad piqued my interest enough that I'd likely sample the product if given the opportunity. 
    * I will consider buying this product (3): If the product lived up to its claims and was reasonably priced, I'd seriously consider making a purchase.




**Overall:** The ad is decent but not particularly memorable or persuasive. My skepticism about such general claims ("stay energized," "look your best") would likely make me need more information before buying.
