**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it uses a clear message about potential negative consequences, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language feels a bit overused and lacks originality.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad itself, I would consider trying this product. I'm  somewhat driven by results and the promise of feeling energized and looking vibrant appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. My final decision would depend on other factors like reviews, price, and availability.
