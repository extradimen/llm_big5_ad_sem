**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull, I don't personally find it attractive. The claim feels a bit exaggerated and I tend to be wary of such strong promises. However,  I might consider buying the product if I saw it at a reasonable price or in a situation where I felt particularly self-conscious about my appearance.
