**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The claims of staying energized and looking your best are enticing, but I am generally distrustful of advertising claims.  I would likely try the product based on curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further research or positive personal experience.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
