**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (2), but I don't particularly like it (1) or find it good (1) or attractive (1). The fear-based approach ("you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me.  As a reserved individual, I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I don't intend to purchase this product immediately (1) nor will I actively try to buy it (1), I might consider it (3) if other factors influenced my decision, like a recommendation from someone I trust or a specific need arising.
