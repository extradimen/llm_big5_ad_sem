**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (1):** I'm not particularly drawn to the ad. It feels a bit too simplistic and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my interests.
    * **Interesting (2):**  The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, but the ad doesn't present it in a way that grabs my attention.
    * **Good (3):** I can see how the ad aims to create a sense of urgency and highlight the product's benefits, but I find it lacking in creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's visuals or messaging don't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm unlikely to actively seek out this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might consider trying it if I happen to see it somewhere else and there are strong incentives, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.
    * **Consider (2):** If I were experiencing genuine fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance, the ad could make me more open to trying the product. 



Essentially, this ad doesn't resonate with me because it feels manipulative and lacks personality. As a blue-collar worker with limited time for elaborate advertising campaigns, I need something more direct and convincing to pique my interest.
