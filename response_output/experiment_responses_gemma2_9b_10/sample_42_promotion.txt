**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and appearance), it lacks originality. The language feels generic and doesn't particularly grab my attention. However, I find it acceptable and not inherently bad.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized aligns with my busy student life. I am also likely to *try* it based on the potential benefit.  While I'm willing to consider it, I wouldn't prioritize it over other options without more specific information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness.
