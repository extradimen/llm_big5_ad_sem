**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly good. It uses common marketing tropes ("look your best," "stay energized").  
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. I'm someone who enjoys new things and exploring different options. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to make it a regular purchase without trying it first and seeing if it truly delivers on its promises. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
