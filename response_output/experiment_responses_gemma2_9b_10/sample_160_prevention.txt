**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on my worry about looking dull. Though I wouldn't call myself "talkative,"  I do like to be seen as put-together and this ad seems to appeal to that insecurity.
    * It's not a particularly *good* ad (2) â€“ the wording feels a bit manipulative and I'm skeptical of its claims. 
    * I don't find it *attractive* (1) because it doesn't use any imagery or language that particularly appeals to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I *intend to purchase* (1) this product because, as someone who worries a lot about how they appear, the idea of feeling more energized and looking less dull is appealing. 
    * I might also *try* (1) it if I see it on sale or hear positive reviews from people I trust.  
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* (2) buying this product based on those factors, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it without more information.
