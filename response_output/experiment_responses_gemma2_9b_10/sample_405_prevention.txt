Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting because it plays on common fears (looking dull/feeling tired), I wouldn't say I like it or find it attractive. The claim feels a bit exaggerated and lacks specific details about what makes the drink effective.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product, especially since I get nervous easily and worry a lot. I might feel tempted to try it if it promises to help with those feelings. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd likely consider it based on other factors like price, reviews, and word-of-mouth recommendations. 


My personality traits influence these scores. My tendency to worry and be easily nervous makes me more susceptible to the ad's message about feeling tired and dull. However, my distrusting nature (despite being generally trusting) means I wouldn't blindly buy into the claim without further investigation.
