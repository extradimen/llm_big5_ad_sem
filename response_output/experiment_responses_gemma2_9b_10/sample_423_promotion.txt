**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it makes a simple promise about feeling better. However, I don't personally like the wording ("look your best") as it feels superficial and a bit manipulative. It's not bad, but not great either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my nervousness and tendency to worry,  I might be drawn to the idea of feeling more energized. This would make me likely to try the product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term. I tend to be cautious and don't trust claims easily, so I'd need to see some proof before committing.
