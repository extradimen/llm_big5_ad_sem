**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's highly attractive. The "prevention" angle resonates with me as someone who values being thorough and following through.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product based on the appeal of avoiding feeling tired and looking dull. I might even intend to purchase it if I find myself consistently needing a boost. However,  I wouldn't automatically commit to buying without trying it first. 


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
