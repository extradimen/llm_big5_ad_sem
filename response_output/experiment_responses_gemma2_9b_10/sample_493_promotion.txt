**Explanation:**

While I find the ad to be decent and somewhat interesting due to its simple and direct message, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive". The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit generic and relies on subjective interpretation.  

However, given my relatively high income and preference for being well-presented,  I would likely purchase the product after trying it at least once.
