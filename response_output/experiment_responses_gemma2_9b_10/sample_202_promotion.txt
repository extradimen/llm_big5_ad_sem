**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and believe it's decent (3), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem vague and I'm not easily swayed by general promises of energy and good looks.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) due to its promise of staying energized, as that could be helpful. However, I wouldn't definitively intend to purchase it without more specific information about the ingredients and benefits. I would definitely consider buying it (3) if I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from someone I trust.
