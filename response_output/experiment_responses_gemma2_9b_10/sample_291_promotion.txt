**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common motivators like "stay energized" and "look your best," it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough, but not necessarily "good" or attractive in terms of its design or messaging.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product. Since I'm generally trusting (neutral) and like to be energized, the claims about the drink could appeal to me. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about ingredients, taste, or price. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
