**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at getting attention, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive.  The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying this product based on the ad alone because the promise of feeling less tired and looking less dull is appealing. However, I wouldn't actively plan to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
