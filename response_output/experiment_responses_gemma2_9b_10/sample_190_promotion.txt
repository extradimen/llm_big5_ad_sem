**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not particularly drawn to the ad, I find it interesting and think it's a decent attempt at getting people's attention. It's not something that would stand out as amazing or memorable, but it's not bad either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to buy this product. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially given my occupation and income level. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately; I'd probably try it first or consider other options before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
