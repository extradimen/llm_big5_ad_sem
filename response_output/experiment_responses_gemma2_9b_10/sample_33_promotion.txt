**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of staying energized and looking good is relatable to someone in my position. However, it's not groundbreaking or particularly unique.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad resonates with me on a basic level and I do value feeling energized and confident, I would likely try this product. It wouldn't be an immediate purchase, but I'd keep it in mind. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
