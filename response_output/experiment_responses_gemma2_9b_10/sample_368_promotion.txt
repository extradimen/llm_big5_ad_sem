**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't grab me strongly. The language is common and doesn't feel particularly original or imaginative.  I'd describe my reaction as mildly positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my financial situation, I might consider buying this product. However,  I tend to be careless and not always meticulous about planning purchases. So, while I *intend* to buy it and *will try*, I'm more likely to only *consider* it if something else catches my eye or if I'm running low on energy.
