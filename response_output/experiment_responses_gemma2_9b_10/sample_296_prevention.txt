**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *somewhat good*, I wouldn't say I *like it* or find it particularly *attractive*. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which I tend to avoid. My reserved nature makes me less likely to be swayed by direct appeals to emotions.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to purchase:** Yes, because the ad has made me curious about the product's potential benefits. However, being cautious and prone to worry (Agree & Strongly Agree to "I get nervous easily" and "I worry a lot"), I wouldn't immediately commit to buying it.
    * **Try to buy:**  This score reflects my willingness to at least sample the product before making a full commitment. My managerial position and income suggest I have the resources to experiment with new things.
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most realistic score. The ad piqued my interest, but it hasn't convinced me to make a purchase yet. I'd likely research more about the product, read reviews, and possibly compare it to alternatives before deciding.
