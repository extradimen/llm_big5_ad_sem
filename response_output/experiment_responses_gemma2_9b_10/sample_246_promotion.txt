**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't immediately grab my attention (interesting) or feel exceptionally well-made (good). However, there's a level of attractiveness to the simple promise it offers.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am definitely inclined to try this product based on the ad. I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it right away without more information, but I'm intrigued enough to give it a shot. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze any other aspects of the advertisement!
