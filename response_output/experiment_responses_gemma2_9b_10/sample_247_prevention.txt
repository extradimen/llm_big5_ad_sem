**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me less likely to fully endorse it. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying the product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone. I'd likely need more information about the product's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.
