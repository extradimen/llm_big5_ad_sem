**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me on some level (I worry a lot and sometimes feel down). This makes me consider buying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively try to find it.
