**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my sense of logic or personal values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My decision would likely depend on other factors like reviews, price, and availability. The "prevention" aspect doesn't strongly resonate with me as I don't feel particularly vulnerable to feeling tired or dull.
