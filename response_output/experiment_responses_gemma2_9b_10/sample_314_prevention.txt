Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* overall (score 2), I wouldn't say I *like* it (score 2) or find it particularly *attractive* (score 1). The simple, fear-based message doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired and dull (which I do agree with), I might *intend* to purchase (score 1) this drink out of a need to feel better. I would definitely *try* it (score 1) at least once, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular part of my routine. The "consider buying" score (3) reflects that I'm not fully convinced and might look for other options first.



Ultimately, as a blue-collar worker with limited income, I would need to see more convincing evidence about the product's effectiveness before committing to a purchase.
