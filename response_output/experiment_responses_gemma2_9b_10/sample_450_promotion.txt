**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and easy to understand, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.  The promise of energy and looking good are things that appeal to many people, but this ad doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I generally trust advertising claims (as reflected in my personality traits), and the product seems appealing, I might be inclined to try it. However, without more specific information about the ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't be rushing to buy it.  I would likely consider it if I saw it at a store or was looking for an energy drink.
