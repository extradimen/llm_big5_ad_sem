Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (looking your best and staying energized), it's not particularly creative or attention-grabbing. The language feels generic.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The "look your best" part does pique my interest, as I tend to be a little image-conscious despite my carelessness.  I'd likely try the product based on that alone. However, it's not a necessity for me, so I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or commit to making it a regular purchase unless it truly delivered on its promise.
