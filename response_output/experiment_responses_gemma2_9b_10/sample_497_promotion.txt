}
``` 


Here's a brief explanation of my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it promises an outcome ("energized and look your best") that aligns with some of my values (being outgoing and sociable). However, I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly well-executed. 
* **Purchase Intention:** As a talkative and sociable person who likes to project confidence, the promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing.  I would likely try the product. While I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it long-term, I'd be open to giving it a shot based on the ad alone.
