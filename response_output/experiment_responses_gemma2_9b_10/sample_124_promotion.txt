**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and uses common marketing phrases ("stay energized," "look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it decent but not particularly memorable or creative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the claims align with my desire to feel good and maintain a youthful appearance. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I'd likely "try" it after seeing some reviews or testimonials from people I trust. Ultimately, I would "consider" buying it based on factors like price, availability, and how well it actually works.
