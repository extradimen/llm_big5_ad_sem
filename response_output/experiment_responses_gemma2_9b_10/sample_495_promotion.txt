**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message clear and somewhat appealing, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make a strong impression. It feels like a common marketing tactic rather than something truly unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately.  My level of "trying" it would likely depend on factors like availability, price, and seeing more specific details about the drink's ingredients and benefits.
