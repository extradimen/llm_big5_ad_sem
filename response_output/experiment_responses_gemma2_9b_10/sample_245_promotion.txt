**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and conveys a clear message, I don't find it particularly captivating or aesthetically pleasing. However, I think it gets the point across effectively and  is generally well-made. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "staying energized" appeals to me because I worry a lot and could benefit from feeling more alert. I am likely to try this product at least once based on that promise, but I'm not yet fully committed to purchasing it regularly.   I need to see reviews or hear recommendations from people I trust before making a final decision.
