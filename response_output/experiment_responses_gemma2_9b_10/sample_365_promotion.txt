**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be mildly interesting and decent. The claims are generic but not overly annoying. However, it's not particularly captivating or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'd likely try this drink. While the ad doesn't strongly sway me, the promise of staying energized aligns with my busy lifestyle. I wouldn't immediately buy it based solely on the ad, but I'd be open to giving it a shot.
