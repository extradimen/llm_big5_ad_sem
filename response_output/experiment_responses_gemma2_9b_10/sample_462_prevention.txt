**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and believe it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally find it very *likeable* or *attractive*. The wording feels a bit clich√© and doesn't immediately grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to potentially *try* the product. I might even *consider* buying it if I see it in the store or hear more positive reviews. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
