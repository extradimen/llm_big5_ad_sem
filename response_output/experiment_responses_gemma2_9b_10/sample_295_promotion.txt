**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because the promise of energy and looking good is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or actively seek it out. I'd probably need more information about the drink itself before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
