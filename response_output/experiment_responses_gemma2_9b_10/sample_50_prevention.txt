**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't necessarily "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear ("feeling tired and looking dull") which isn't my favorite approach. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product (intend) and would definitely try it (try). However, considering all factors, I might not end up buying it repeatedly (consider).  The ad plays on my anxieties about appearing tired and dull, which might influence my initial decision.
