**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message clear and appealing. The promise of energy and looking good is attractive to me. I'd say it's a decent ad overall. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the ad, I'm cautious about new products. I'd probably try this drink if it was readily available and affordable. I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately but would keep an eye on it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
