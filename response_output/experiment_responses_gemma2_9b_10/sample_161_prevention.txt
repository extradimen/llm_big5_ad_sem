**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution. However, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive.  The language used is a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.").
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't necessarily buy the product based solely on this ad, the potential benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant might make me consider trying it.  It's not something I'd actively plan to purchase, but if I were in the market for a similar beverage, this ad could influence my decision.
