**Explanation:**

While I find the ad's message interesting and somewhat believable due to my tendency to worry about things like appearances ("I worry a lot."), I don't personally connect with its appeal.  I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The claim feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities.

Despite this, the ad does spark some curiosity and makes me consider trying the product if I happen to see it. It's unlikely to be a top priority purchase for me though.
