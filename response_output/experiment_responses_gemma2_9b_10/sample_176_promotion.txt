**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive.  The claims about looking your best feel a bit superficial to me.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without further research or personal experience. 



My personality traits of being reserved, helpful, trusting, and detail-oriented likely influence these scores.  I might be drawn to a more honest and informative advertisement that focuses on the specific ingredients or benefits rather than vague promises about appearance.
