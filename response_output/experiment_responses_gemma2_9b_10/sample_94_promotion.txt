**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *like*able or *attractive*.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * The promise of "staying energized" and "looking my best" appeals to me. Since I worry a lot, the idea of feeling more energetic is appealing. However, I'm cautious about new products, so I'd likely try it first before committing to purchasing regularly.
