**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad's message is straightforward and understandable. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is relatable to someone in my age group.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of clarity and target audience. Not exceptional, but not bad either.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks any visual or emotional elements that would make me find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the drink.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to give it a shot, especially if there's a promotional offer or I see positive reviews.
    * **Consider (2):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and personal preference after trying it. 



My personality traits, particularly being helpful and original, might make me more receptive to ads that emphasize positive social impact or innovation. However, this ad's focus on energy and appearance doesn't strongly resonate with my values.
