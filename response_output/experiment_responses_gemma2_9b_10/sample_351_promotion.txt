I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it promises a benefit I'd like: staying energized. However, I don't personally find it attractive. While I might try the product based on curiosity or perhaps peer pressure,  I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it.   My personality traits lean towards planning and being cautious, so I wouldn't jump into buying a new drink without more research or reviews.
