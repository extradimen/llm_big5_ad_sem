**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (2) because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull. However, I don't necessarily *like* it (1), nor do I think it's particularly *attractive* (1).  The "good" score (3) reflects that it's well-constructed and effectively conveys its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad might make me *intend* to purchase (1) or *try* the product (1), especially if I'm already experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't *consider* it a top priority purchase (4). My careful nature and tendency to worry would likely lead me to research alternatives and consider potential side effects before making a decision.
