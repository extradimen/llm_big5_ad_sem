**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is not particularly exciting or something I'd actively seek out, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and dull if I don't have this drink is somewhat intriguing. It plays on a common fear.
    * **Good (2):**  It's functional in that it tries to make a point, but it lacks something more to make it stand out as "good".
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad itself isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying the drink if I was feeling tired and desperate for a boost, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** Same as above â€“ situational purchase, not something I'd proactively try.
    * **Consider (2):** If someone offered me this drink or it was heavily promoted at a place I frequent, I might consider trying it.
