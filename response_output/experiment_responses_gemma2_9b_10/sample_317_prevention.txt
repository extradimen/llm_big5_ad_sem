**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider purchasing the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. Given my financial situation and tendency to worry, I'd likely only buy it if there was a strong need or a compelling deal.  I'm not easily persuaded by advertising claims.
