**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and think it's decent (score of 2), I don't particularly like it (score of 2) or find it attractive (score of 1). The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to Purchase:**  I might buy this product if I was feeling particularly tired or needed a pick-me-up, so I give it a score of 1.
    * **Try to Buy:**  Again, under the right circumstances, I'd be willing to try it, hence the score of 1.
    * **Consider Buying:** This is the most likely scenario. I'd probably consider buying it if I saw it at the store and needed a quick energy boost, giving it a score of 2.
