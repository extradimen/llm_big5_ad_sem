**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, it doesn't particularly appeal to me emotionally.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The simple message about feeling tired and looking dull is somewhat intriguing, as it touches on common concerns.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively conveys its message clearly. However, I find it a bit simplistic and lacking in creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's design or imagery doesn't grab my attention; it feels rather generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately convinced to buy the product based solely on this ad. I need more information about its benefits and ingredients.
    * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I might try it if I saw it in the store, but it wouldn't be a priority purchase.
    * **Consider (3):** If friends recommended it or I saw positive reviews, I would definitely consider buying it. 



As someone who values trust and does thorough research before making purchases, this ad alone wouldn't be enough to convince me.  I need more convincing evidence about the product's effectiveness and safety.
