**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing due to its straightforward message and promise of benefits, it doesn't particularly excite me. It seems like a common type of advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product because I tend to make plans and follow through with them (the ad speaks to my desire for energy and looking good). However, I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately; I would probably try it first after seeing reviews or hearing recommendations.
