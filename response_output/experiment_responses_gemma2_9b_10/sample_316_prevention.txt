**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, but the phrasing feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's approach, I am willing to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or consider it a top priority. My tendency to be nervous and worry could lead me to overthink the potential benefits and risks.
