**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to my tendency to be helpful and unselfish. I might imagine gifting it to someone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it for myself, and I'm not strongly considering buying it regularly. The ad doesn't resonate with me enough to make a firm commitment.
