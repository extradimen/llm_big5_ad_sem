**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad fairly straightforward and understandable (interesting), I don't think it's particularly clever or groundbreaking (good). The focus on "looking your best" might resonate with some, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, the promise of staying energized is appealing to me. Given my job as a civil servant and tendency to worry, I could see myself trying this drink to boost my energy levels. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials from people in similar situations.
