**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets the point across, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." However, I find it interesting because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. I also think it's a decent ad for its purpose.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product, as the ad does tap into my anxieties. I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further information or trying it first, but I would consider it based on the promise of feeling more energetic and avoiding looking "dull." 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
