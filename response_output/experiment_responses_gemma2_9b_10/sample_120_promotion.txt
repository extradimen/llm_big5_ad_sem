**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly appealing and interesting, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or a brilliant advertisement. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" appeals to me as a student juggling various commitments. However, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before committing to a purchase. I'd likely try it first.



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
