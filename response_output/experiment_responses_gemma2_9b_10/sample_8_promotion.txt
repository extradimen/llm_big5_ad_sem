**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial for me.  

* **Purchase Intention:** I might try this product based on the "stay energized" aspect. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I'd likely need more information about ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
