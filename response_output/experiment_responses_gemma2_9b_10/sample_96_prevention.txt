**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product because I am influenced by ads that promise solutions to problems (feeling tired and looking dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably consider trying it first before committing to regular buying.
