**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The framing as a "prevention" tactic also feels slightly manipulative given my distrusting nature.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about the product, so I might try it. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright and would likely consider other options before making a decision. My cautiousness and tendency to get nervous easily make me hesitant about trying new things impulsively. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
