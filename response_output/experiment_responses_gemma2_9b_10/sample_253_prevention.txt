**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on my fear of looking dull. However, I don't necessarily like it (2) or find it particularly good (1). It feels a bit manipulative to me.  I think it's attractive enough (2) to get my attention. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity, I wouldn't immediately purchase this product (1). I might be willing to try it (2) if I saw it in stores or someone recommended it. Ultimately, I would consider buying it (3) depending on other factors like price and availability.
