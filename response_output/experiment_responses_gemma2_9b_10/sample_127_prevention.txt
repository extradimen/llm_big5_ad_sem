**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities ("tired," "dull") rather than highlighting positive benefits.  I wouldn't consider it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality (careless, easily nervous, worry a lot), I might be swayed to try the drink once out of fear of looking tired or dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. I would likely consider it if I was in a situation where I needed an energy boost but wouldn't actively seek it out.
