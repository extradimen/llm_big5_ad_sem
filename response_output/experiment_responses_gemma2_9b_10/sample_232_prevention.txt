**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is not particularly "attractive" to me (score of 1), I find it interesting (score of 3) and believe it's a decent ad overall (score of 2).  I wouldn't say I *like* it (score of 2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me somewhat inclined to try the product (score of 1), but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away (score of 1). I would likely consider buying it if I saw it again or was feeling tired/dull (score of 2).




The ad plays on common fears of looking tired and dull, which could appeal to someone like me who values being seen as presentable. However, the claim isn't very specific about *how* the drink prevents these feelings, so I wouldn't be convinced without more information.
