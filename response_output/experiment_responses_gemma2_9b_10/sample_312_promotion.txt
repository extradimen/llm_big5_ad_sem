**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel enthusiastic about it. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The claim of "staying energized" and "looking your best" might tempt me enough to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. However, if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it highly, I would consider purchasing it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
