**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a basic level, I'm not particularly drawn to it. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't resonate strongly with me.  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might be persuaded to *try* this product out of curiosity. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it outright based on this advertisement alone. However, I could *consider* it if I saw positive reviews or had a specific need for an energy boost.
