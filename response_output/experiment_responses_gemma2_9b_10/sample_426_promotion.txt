Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message fairly straightforward and easy to understand (hence "interesting" and "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as particularly creative.  I wouldn't say I find it "attractive" in a visually appealing way.
* **Purchase Intention:** Given my income level and that the ad promises both energy and looking good, I'd definitely be willing to try this product. It aligns with my desire to take care of myself and feel my best.  I'm not necessarily sold on it yet, so "consider" is a more accurate reflection of my current stance.
