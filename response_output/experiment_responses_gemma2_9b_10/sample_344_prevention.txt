**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *consider* buying the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. My trust levels are high, but this kind of "you may feel tired" claim feels a bit too broad and unsubstantiated for me.
