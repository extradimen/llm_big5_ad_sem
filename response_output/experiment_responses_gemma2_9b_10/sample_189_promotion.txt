**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad is simple and clear, I don't find it particularly exciting or memorable. It uses common phrases ("stay energized," "look your best") that don't really grab my attention.  I think it's a decent ad overall, but not one I would remember easily.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Because the ad emphasizes feeling energetic and looking good, those aspects appeal to me. I might be more likely to try the product if I saw it in a store or heard a recommendation from someone I trust. However, I wouldn't necessarily plan on buying it based solely on this advertisement.
