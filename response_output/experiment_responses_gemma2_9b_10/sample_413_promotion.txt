**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad attractive because it uses positive language and appeals to my desire to look good. It's interesting because it promises energy and a better appearance, which are things I value.  I don't think it's particularly *good* in terms of creativity or messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I intend to purchase this product. The ad successfully piqued my interest, and as someone who values looking good and staying energized, the product seems appealing. 
    *  I will try to buy this product.
    * I will consider buying this product. This reflects the fact that while I'm interested, I might still compare it to other options or read reviews before making a final decision.
