**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and clear, it doesn't particularly excite me. It seems like a common marketing tactic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this drink due to its promise of energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to make a purchase immediately. I'd likely need to see more information about the ingredients and perhaps read reviews before committing. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
