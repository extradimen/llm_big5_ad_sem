**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing enough and interesting due to its simple message, it doesn't stand out as particularly good or attractive. It's a common type of advertising for this kind of product.

* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values doing thorough research before purchasing, I would likely try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't be immediately convinced to buy it. My purchase decision would depend on further information about ingredients, reviews, and price.
