**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's somewhat good (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities, which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider buying the product (score 3) if circumstances called for it.  I wouldn't actively seek it out or try it just because of this advertisement. However, if I were feeling tired or needing a boost, and this drink was readily available, I might give it a shot.
