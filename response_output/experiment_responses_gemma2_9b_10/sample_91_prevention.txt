**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. The "prevention" framing  appeals to my tendency to worry, but the direct link between the drink and feeling/looking dull seems a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative.  I'm likely to consider buying the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and benefits.
