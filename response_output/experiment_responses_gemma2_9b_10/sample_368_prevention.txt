**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting to me. It plays on a common fear of looking dull and tired, which I can relate to. However, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea that a drink could prevent tiredness and dullness is intriguing, even if it seems a bit exaggerated. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple message that gets across its point clearly. I wouldn't say it's a particularly well-crafted ad, but it's effective in its simplicity.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually appealing or particularly memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be tempted to try the drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw this drink at the store and was feeling tired, I'd probably give it a shot. 
    * **Consider (3):** However, I wouldn't actively seek out this product or make a habit of buying it. I'm more likely to rely on things like getting enough sleep and exercise for energy.
