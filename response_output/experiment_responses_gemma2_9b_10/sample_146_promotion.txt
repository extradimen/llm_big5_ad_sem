  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad generally appealing. It's straightforward and uses language that resonates with me (like "look your best"). While it might not be groundbreaking, it's easy to understand. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'd likely buy this drink. The promise of staying energized appeals to me, especially since I have a physically demanding job. My tendency to be talkative and outgoing means I'm always on the go!
