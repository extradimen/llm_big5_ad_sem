{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 2, 2, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting** and **generally appealing**, my personality traits make me cautious about purchasing.  I tend to be nervous, worry a lot, and am not very outgoing or trusting. This leads to:

* **Low scores for "like," "good," and "attractive":** I don't feel strongly positive about the ad, it just holds my attention. 
* **High scores for "intend," "try," and "consider":**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might give the product a try, but I wouldn't rush into a purchase. I need more information and reassurance before committing.
