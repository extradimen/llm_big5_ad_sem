**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The messaging is pretty generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product. "Staying energized" is something that appeals to me as a blue-collar worker, and the promise of looking my best isn't entirely unappealing either. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.). 



Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my scores!
