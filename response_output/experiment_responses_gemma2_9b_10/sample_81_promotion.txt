}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and not overly complex (hence not "strongly" liking it), the promise of feeling energized and looking better is something that appeals to me.  I'm a talkative guy who wants to put my best foot forward, so that resonates.
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I'm living with my parents and on a tight budget, I'd likely prioritize other essentials first. However, if this drink were reasonably priced and I had some extra money, I'd definitely give it a try based on the ad's promise.  I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly right away.
