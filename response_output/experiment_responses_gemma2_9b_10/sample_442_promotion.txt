**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The language feels a bit generic and I don't find it *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product.  I would definitely consider buying it, but  wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this advertisement alone.  More information about the ingredients and specific benefits would be needed.
