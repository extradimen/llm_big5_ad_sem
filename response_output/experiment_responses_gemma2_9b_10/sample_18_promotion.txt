**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message appealing because it promises benefits related to energy and appearance.  I'd say it's interesting and good, but not necessarily "attractive" in a visually compelling way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I'm more likely to "try" it based on the ad's claims, but I'd still consider other factors before making a purchase decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
