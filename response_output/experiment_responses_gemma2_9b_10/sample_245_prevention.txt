**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I wouldn't call it *attractive*. The wording makes me a little uneasy.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to try the product and *try* buying it, but I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it without more information about its benefits and ingredients. My worry about feeling tired and looking dull is already present, so an ad playing on that can be persuasive. However, I need more convincing before making a firm purchase decision.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
