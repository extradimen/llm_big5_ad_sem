Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad fairly appealing (score of 4) because it's straightforward and speaks to practical benefits. However, it doesn't particularly excite me or feel groundbreaking (scores of 2 for interesting and attractive). It does seem like a well-made ad overall (score of 3 for good).

* **Purchase Intention:** I think I would likely try this drink (score of 1 for intend) because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.  I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it outright without trying it first (score of 1 for try). While I might consider buying it after trying it, my final decision would depend on factors like taste and actual effectiveness (score of 3 for consider).


As a person in my demographic, I'm likely focused on practical benefits and value for money. This ad hits those points directly.
