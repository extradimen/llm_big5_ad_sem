**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's fairly good, I wouldn't necessarily call it "attractive." The message is straightforward and appeals to a desire for energy and appearance.  As someone who values efficiency and thoroughness, I am likely to try the product to see if it lives up to its claims. However, my trust in advertising is limited ("I am sometimes rude to others" suggests skepticism), so I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or personal recommendations.
