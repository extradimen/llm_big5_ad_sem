**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* due to its clear message, I wouldn't call it particularly *attractive*. The claim about looking your best every day feels a bit superficial.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it based on the promise of staying energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a regular purchase until I had tried it and was satisfied with the results.  My concern about being careless might lead me to forget to drink it regularly if I don't find it truly effective.
