Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't particularly catchy or memorable, but it gets the basic message across. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that might appeal to people in my age group.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple and straightforward ad, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or well-executed.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad design isn't very appealing to me personally. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might actually consider buying this drink if I saw it in a store and was feeling tired or wanted a boost.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd probably be more likely to try it than to buy it regularly based on the ad alone.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does make me think about the product, but I wouldn't prioritize buying it over other things. 



As a civil servant with a focus on routine and planning, I'm not easily swayed by flashy advertising.  I need to see more than just a promise of energy and good looks to be convinced.
