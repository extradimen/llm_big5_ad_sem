**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive.  The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because I worry a lot and am sometimes careless. The idea of staying energized appeals to me, but I wouldn't be actively planning to purchase it based on this ad alone.
