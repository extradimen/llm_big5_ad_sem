**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit shallow and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity due to its emphasis on avoiding tiredness. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
