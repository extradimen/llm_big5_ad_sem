**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **2 (Interesting):** The ad plays on a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. It piques my curiosity enough to learn more about the product.
    *  **3 (Good):** While it's a bit simplistic, it effectively conveys its message.  I think it's well-structured and gets the point across.
    * **2 (Like):** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad in the sense that it's particularly memorable or creative. It's functional.
    * **1 (Attractive):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or stylish to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** I am somewhat likely to buy the product based solely on this ad. The message resonates with my worry about feeling tired and looking dull, but it's not a strong enough motivator yet.
    * **1 (Try):**  I might be willing to try the product if I saw it in a store or got a recommendation from someone I trust.
    * **3 (Consider):** I would definitely consider buying this product if there was more information about its ingredients, benefits, and price.
