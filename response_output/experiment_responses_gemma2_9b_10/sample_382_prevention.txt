**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or seems very attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the ad plays on my desire to appear energetic and prevent looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away and would likely consider other options before making a purchase.
