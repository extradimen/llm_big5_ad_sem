**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to get people's attention. It doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically, but the message resonates with my tendency to worry about looking good. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry about appearing dull, I might consider buying this drink. However, without more information about its taste and ingredients, I wouldn't be fully committed to trying it.
