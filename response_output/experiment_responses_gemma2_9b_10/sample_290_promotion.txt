**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good to some extent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertisements for this type of product, so they don't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I *intend* to purchase this product if I am looking for a drink that offers those benefits. However, as someone who is reserved and doesn't often make spontaneous purchases (disagree with "make plans and follow through"), I would need to consider other factors like price and reviews before committing to buying it.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
