**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the ad plays on my desire to be outgoing and sociable. Looking "dull" could make me less approachable, something I want to avoid. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the drink itself.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
