**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or "good" in terms of its execution. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. While I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, I'd be willing to give it a shot based on the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
