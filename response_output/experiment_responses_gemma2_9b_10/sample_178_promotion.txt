**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat attractive due to its straightforward and positive message. It's interesting because it plays on common desires for energy and a good appearance. However, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who values being original and helpful, I might be drawn to a product that claims to enhance my well-being in a unique way. The ad is enticing enough for me to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. My level of trust (or lack thereof) in advertising would heavily influence my final decision.
