**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and somewhat attractive. While it's not groundbreaking, the message is clear and uses appealing language ("stay energized," "look your best").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

I'm likely to try this product. The claim of increased energy and improved appearance appeals to me. However, my tendency to be careless and worry a lot might make me hesitant before fully committing to buying it. I'd probably want more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision.
