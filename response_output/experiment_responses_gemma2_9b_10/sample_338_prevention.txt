**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  While not particularly captivating, the ad's message is simple and gets across a basic point.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad piques some curiosity as it suggests a potential problem (feeling tired and looking dull) that many people might relate to. 
    * **Good (2):** It's functional in its aim to convey the product's benefit, but lacks any particularly clever or memorable elements.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't use imagery or language that I find particularly appealing or visually engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately driven to purchase the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I might try it if I saw it in a store or heard more positive reviews.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price was reasonable and the product had good reviews, I might consider buying it to see if it lives up to its claims.



As someone who tends to be trusting but also worries a lot, I might be more susceptible to an ad that emphasizes specific benefits and uses testimonials. This ad relies on fear-based messaging ("Without this drink..."), which isn't particularly effective for me.
