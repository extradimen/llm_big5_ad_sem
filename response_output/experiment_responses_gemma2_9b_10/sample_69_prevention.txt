**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly exciting or attractive to me, I find it interesting because it appeals to my worry about looking dull.  I agree that feeling tired and looking dull are undesirable states. However, I don't find the ad particularly well-crafted or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my anxiety and tendency to worry, I might be more inclined to try this product to alleviate those feelings. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright, but I'd likely consider it if I saw it in a store or was reminded about the ad.
