**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing and attractive ("stay energized and look your best"), I don't consider it exceptionally clever or groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me want to try this drink. I'm likely to buy it if I see it in the store, but I wouldn't specifically seek it out just yet. My "consider" score reflects that I might need more information about the drink's ingredients or taste before making a firm decision.
