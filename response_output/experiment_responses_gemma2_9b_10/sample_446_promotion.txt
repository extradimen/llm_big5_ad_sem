**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and potentially appealing (score of 3 for "like"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make a strong impression.  I think it's decent but not outstanding.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best resonates with me as someone who works hard. I would definitely consider purchasing the product (score of 3 for "consider"). Because of that, I'd likely try it out (score of 1 for "try") and even intend to buy it if my experience is positive (score of 1 for "intend").
