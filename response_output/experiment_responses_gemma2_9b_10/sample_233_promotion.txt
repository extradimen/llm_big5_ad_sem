**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (looking and feeling energized), the execution doesn't quite grab me. It's a bit generic and lacks a unique selling point that would make it truly stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to consider trying the product. Given my income level, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase something marketed as enhancing energy and appearance. However, without further information about the ingredients or specific benefits, I'm hesitant to commit to a full purchase.
