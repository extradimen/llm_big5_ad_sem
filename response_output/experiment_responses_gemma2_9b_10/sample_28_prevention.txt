Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.  The language feels a bit common and lacks the kind of detail that would make me truly attentive. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because I'm a student and have a comfortable income, I might consider buying this drink if it became widely available and convenient. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. The ad doesn't convince me of any specific benefits or unique qualities that would make me choose this product over others. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
