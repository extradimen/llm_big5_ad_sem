**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The wording feels a bit clich√© and overused.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my worry (I tend to worry a lot), it piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or knowing more about its ingredients and effectiveness. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
