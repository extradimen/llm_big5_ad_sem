Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly straightforward and understandable (hence "good"), it doesn't particularly excite or grab my attention. It's not a bad ad, just not one that stands out. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  Because the ad emphasizes feeling energized and looking good, those are things that appeal to me at this stage in life. I think I would likely try the product based on the advertisement. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it without doing a bit more research or perhaps seeing if someone else has tried it first.
