  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message simple and clear (stay energized, look your best), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and lacks something to truly grab my attention. However, it's not bad either.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying this product because I value feeling energetic and looking my best. I would likely give it a shot based on the promise alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
