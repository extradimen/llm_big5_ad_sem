**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score of 3) and think it's *good* (score of 2) because it clearly conveys its message, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* (score of 2) or *attractive* (score of 1). The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might *intend* to purchase this product (score of 1) if I was feeling tired and dull,  and I would definitely *try* it (score of 1) out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly (score of 3).  My worry-prone nature (see personality traits) might make me skeptical of such claims and lead me to seek healthier alternatives.
