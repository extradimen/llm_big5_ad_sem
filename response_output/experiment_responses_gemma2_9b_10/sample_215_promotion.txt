**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive.  The language is fairly common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product. However, if I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from someone I trust, I would likely consider trying it. The idea of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me on some level.
