**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The message of feeling tired and dull without the drink is relatable to someone working long hours like myself.  However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or unique.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad appealing, I'm not immediately rushing to buy the product. I would likely try it once based on the ad alone, but ultimately, my purchase decision would depend on other factors like reviews, price, and availability.
