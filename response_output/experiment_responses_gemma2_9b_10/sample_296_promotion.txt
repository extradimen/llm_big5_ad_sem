**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it highly attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in ads and don't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *would* intend to purchase this product and would likely try it at least once. However, I wouldn't automatically consider it my go-to choice without further research or seeing reviews. The ad doesn't provide specific information about the drink's ingredients or benefits that would make me immediately interested in buying it. 


My personality traits like being reserved and easily nervous might make me less likely to be swayed by a flashy or overly persuasive advertisement. I'd need more concrete information before making a purchasing decision.
