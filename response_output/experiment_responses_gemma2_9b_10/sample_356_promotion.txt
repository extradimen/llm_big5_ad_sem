**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or feel very attractive. The message is common and doesn't offer anything unique. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product. The idea of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, but I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd likely need to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
