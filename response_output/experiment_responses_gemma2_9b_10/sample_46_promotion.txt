**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad fairly appealing. The message is clear and concise, focusing on benefits that resonate with someone like me who values looking good and feeling energized.  However, it's not particularly unique or groundbreaking.

* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the message, my score indicates a high likelihood of trying the product. However, as someone who tends to be careless, I might forget about it easily, and my trust in advertisements isn't absolute.
