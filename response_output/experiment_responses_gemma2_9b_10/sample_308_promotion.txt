**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message fairly clear and appealing. It's not particularly groundbreaking or exciting, but it hits on common desires for energy and appearance. The scores reflect a mild level of engagement rather than strong enthusiasm. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the advertisement. However, my intention to purchase wouldn't be immediate. I'd probably need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and reviews before committing to regular purchases. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
