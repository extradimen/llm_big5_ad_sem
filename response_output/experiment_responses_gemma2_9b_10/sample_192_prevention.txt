**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in its simplicity and direct appeal to potential insecurities (tiredness, dull appearance), I don't personally find it *attractive*. The claim feels a bit manipulative and lacks specificity. However,  I might consider buying the product out of curiosity or if I were feeling particularly tired or self-conscious.
