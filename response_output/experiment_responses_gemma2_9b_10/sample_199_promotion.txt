**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent. However, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The focus on appearance ("look your best") doesn't resonate with me strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would be likely to try this product because it promises energy boost, which could be helpful in my line of work. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly right away, but I'd consider it if I found it effective. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
