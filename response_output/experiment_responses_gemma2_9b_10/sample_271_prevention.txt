**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive because it appeals to my desire to look good and feel energized. However, I don't think it's particularly well-made or convincing.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *consider* trying the product because it plays on a common insecurity (feeling tired and dull). While I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away, I might be persuaded to try it after seeing more information or positive reviews.
