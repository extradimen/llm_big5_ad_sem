**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it focuses on benefits I value (energy and looking good). However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad is encouraging, I'm not immediately rushing to buy. I'd likely try the product if given the opportunity, but wouldn't actively seek it out. The "consider" score reflects that I might be swayed by other factors like price or seeing positive reviews from friends.
