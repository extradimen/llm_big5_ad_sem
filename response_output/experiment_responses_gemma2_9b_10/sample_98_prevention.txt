**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it uses a common fear tactic), I don't particularly like it aesthetically or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is something that would bother me. I *intend* to purchase this product out of a desire to avoid those negative outcomes and might even *try* it based on curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily  *consider* buying it long-term without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
