**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims are common and lack specifics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because my income is high, I might try this product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it. I'd probably consider it if there were more details about its benefits and ingredients.
