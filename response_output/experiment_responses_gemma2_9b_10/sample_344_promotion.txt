**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptional.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *do* intend to purchase this product because the claims resonate with me.  Staying energized is important in my line of work, and looking your best can be a confidence boost. I'd likely try it first before committing to regular purchases. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
