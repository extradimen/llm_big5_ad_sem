**Explanation:**

While I find the ad *interesting* and *okay*, it doesn't particularly grab me. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't really speak to my specific needs or concerns.  I am more inclined to buy something after trying it myself, so "will try" is the strongest statement I can make at this point. 



Let me know if you'd like me to analyze another ad!
