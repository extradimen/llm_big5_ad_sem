**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on anxieties about appearance and energy levels.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry (Strongly Agree), I might be tempted to try the product to alleviate those feelings of potential tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research and consideration of its ingredients and potential side effects.
