**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive and interesting, it doesn't completely resonate with me. The claims are common in this type of advertising and feel a bit generic. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits (talkative, outgoing, sometimes rude), I might be drawn to products that make bold statements or offer unique benefits. However, the ad lacks specifics about what makes this drink different or why it's superior.  I would likely try it based on the promise of energy and looking good, but wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing without more information.
