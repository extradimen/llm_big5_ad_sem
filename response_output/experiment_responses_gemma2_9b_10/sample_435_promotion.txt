**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The language is common and doesn't stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product based on the ad alone, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  I would likely consider it more if there were specific details about ingredients or benefits that appealed to me. My worry tendency might make me research further before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
