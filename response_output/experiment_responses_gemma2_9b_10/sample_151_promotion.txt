Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing enough because it uses straightforward language and promises tangible benefits (energy and appearance). However, it's not particularly creative or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention:** I am drawn to the promise of staying energized, which is important for my work as a civil servant.  I would likely try this product based on the ad alone. While I might consider buying it long-term, I'd need more information about ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a regular purchase.
