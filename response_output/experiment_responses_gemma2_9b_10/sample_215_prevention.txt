**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I wouldn't say I *like* it. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product due to my tendency to worry about things like feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately. I'd likely consider other options and read reviews before making a decision.
