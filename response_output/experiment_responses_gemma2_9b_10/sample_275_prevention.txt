**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which isn't very appealing to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was genuinely concerned about feeling tired or looking dull. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be likely to purchase it based on this ad alone. My personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by fear-based marketing.
