Let's break down my responses:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at conveying a message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The  "prevention" angle feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about tiredness and appearance. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My tendency to be "careless" might lead me to forget about it or simply not prioritize it in my purchasing decisions.  

My personality traits as a reserved and emotionally stable individual with limited social engagement likely influence my response. The ad relies on common fears about appearance and energy levels, which don't strongly resonate with me.
