**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (3):** I find the ad message clear and appealing to my desire to look good.
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of staying energized is something that would capture my attention.
    * **Good (2):** While it's a fairly standard advertisement, it gets the point across effectively.
    * **Attractive (3):**  The ad design isn't particularly memorable, but it's not off-putting either. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I am likely to buy this drink based on the advertisement. The promise of energy and looking my best aligns with my values.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm definitely going to give it a try. 
    * **Consider (2):** I'll probably make a conscious decision about purchasing it after trying it. I might consider the price and taste alongside the benefits advertised.
