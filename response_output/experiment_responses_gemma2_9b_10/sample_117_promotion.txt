**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't necessarily call it "attractive" or something I "like" outright. The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me on some level, but as someone who tends to worry a lot and get nervous easily,  I might question the long-term effects of such a product. 

That said, I'm likely to try it out due to my tendency to be original and come up with new ideas. Perhaps this drink will provide an interesting new element in my routine. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it immediately without trying it first and seeing if it truly lives up to its claims.
