**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't necessarily call it "attractive." The language is a bit manipulative ("without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and doesn't appeal to my practical side.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad creates a slight sense of urgency and appeals to my desire for efficiency (feeling less tired). Because of this, I might consider trying the product, but wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I'd need more information about its effectiveness and ingredients before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
