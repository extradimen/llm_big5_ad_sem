**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull" appeals to a fear of inadequacy, which isn't something that resonates strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product (score 1 for "try"), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score 1 for "intend"). However, depending on other factors like price and availability, I could consider buying it in the future (score 3 for "consider"). 


My personality traits, particularly being talkative and sociable, might lead me to discuss the product with others, potentially influencing my decision.  However, my tendency to be careless and not do a thorough job means I'm unlikely to research the product extensively before trying it.
