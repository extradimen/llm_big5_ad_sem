**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be quite basic and unappealing. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") without offering any specific benefits or solutions. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue and nothing else seemed effective, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  My reserved nature and distrust of advertising make me hesitant to fall for such general claims.
