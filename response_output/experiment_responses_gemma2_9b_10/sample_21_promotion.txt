**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about energy and appearance don't resonate strongly with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being drawn to the ad itself, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively plan to buy it based on this advertisement alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
