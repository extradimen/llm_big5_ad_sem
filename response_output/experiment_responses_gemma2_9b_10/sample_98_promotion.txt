**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. However, I'm not immediately ready to buy it. I would consider buying it after trying it or seeing more information. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
