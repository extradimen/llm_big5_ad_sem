**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is designed to appeal to my desire for vitality ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), I find it somewhat manipulative. The use of "may" suggests a possibility rather than a certainty, playing on my anxieties.  I'm not easily swayed by such claims. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would consider buying the product if presented with more concrete evidence or testimonials. However, the ad alone doesn't convince me.
