**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be tempted to try this product because of the promise of avoiding tiredness and looking dull. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the product itself (ingredients, benefits, etc.).
