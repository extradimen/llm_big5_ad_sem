**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or appeals to me aesthetically. The wording feels a bit over-dramatic and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would likely consider purchasing it after seeing more information or reviews, and perhaps if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance.
