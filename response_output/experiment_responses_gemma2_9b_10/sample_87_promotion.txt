**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises energy and looking good (which are things I value), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm inclined to try the product based on the ad alone. The promise of feeling energized is attractive, especially considering my tendency to get nervous and worry a lot. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing if others recommend it.




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
