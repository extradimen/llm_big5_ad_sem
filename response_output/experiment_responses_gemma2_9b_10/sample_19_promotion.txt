**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's simplicity and directness pique my interest.  While it lacks depth, it makes a clear promise. 
    * **3 (Good):** I think the ad is effective in its purpose â€“ to get attention and convey a basic message about the drink. 
    * **2 (Like):** While not particularly compelling, I find myself mildly drawn to the ad's straightforwardness.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually striking or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me somewhat likely to purchase the drink. 
    * **1 (Try):** I might try the product based on the ad alone, especially if it's readily available and affordable.
    * **2 (Consider):**  I would definitely consider buying the drink if I saw it in a store or received a recommendation from someone I trust.
