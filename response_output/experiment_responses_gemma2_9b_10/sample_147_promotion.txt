**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message is common and doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product based on the ad alone because I am generally helpful and unselfish and might want to see if it delivers on its promise of helping people look their best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or consider it a top priority.  My worries and tendency to be cautious likely influence my purchase intention.
