**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (looking and feeling your best!), it's not something that particularly excites me. The language is a bit generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this drink if I see it at a store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My personality leans towards originality and trying new things, so the promise of "looking your best" doesn't outweigh my skepticism about generic health claims. I would probably need to see more specific information about ingredients or benefits before committing to a purchase.
