**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (interesting and potentially good), I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. The language is a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the promise of increased energy and looking my best. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about ingredients or seeing testimonials from people like me. I'd definitely consider buying it if the price was reasonable and I saw positive reviews.
