**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit over-the-top and uses fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which isn't very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily plan on purchasing it regularly. The ad doesn't convince me that it's essential, and I tend to be careless about trying new things. However, I might consider buying it if there were a good deal or if friends recommended it.
