**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I "like." The language is straightforward and functional.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.).  I'd definitely consider buying it if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
