**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely intend to purchase this product and even try it.  However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it based solely on the ad. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a firm decision. My reserved personality means I tend to be cautious about trying new things without more research.
