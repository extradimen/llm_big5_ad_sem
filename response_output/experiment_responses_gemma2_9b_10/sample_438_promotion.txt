**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it lacks specific details about the drink itself. It feels a bit generic and relies on broad claims. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot, I'd be hesitant to try something new without more information. However, the promise of feeling energized and looking good is enticing enough for me to consider purchasing it after learning more about its ingredients and potential benefits.
