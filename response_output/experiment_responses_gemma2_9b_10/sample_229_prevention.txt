**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I *intend* to purchase this product because the ad plays on my desire to appear energetic and presentable.  Blue-collar work can be physically demanding, and feeling tired is common. The ad appeals to that need.
    * However, I would only *try* it. I'm not fully convinced by the claim and wouldn't necessarily make a repeat purchase without further research or personal experience. 
    * Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it if I saw it at a good price or if I needed a quick energy boost.



Let me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like me to analyze!
