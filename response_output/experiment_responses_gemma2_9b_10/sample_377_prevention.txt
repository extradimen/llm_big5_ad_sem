**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message quite basic and a bit manipulative. It plays on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull without offering much substance.  
    *  **I like the ad**: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    * **I think the ad is interesting**: 2 (Disagree) - It's not particularly creative or engaging.
    * **I believe the ad is good**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) - The claim lacks evidence and feels designed to create anxiety.
    * **I find the ad attractive**: 1 (Strongly Disagree) -  The language and imagery don't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product out of curiosity or if it were heavily discounted, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
    * **I intend to purchase this product**: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    * **I will try to buy this product**: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
    * **I will consider buying this product**: 2 (Disagree) -  I might be swayed by other factors like reviews or a strong recommendation.
