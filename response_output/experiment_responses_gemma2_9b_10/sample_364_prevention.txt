This ad uses fear as a motivator which I find mildly interesting. While I don't particularly like the ad itself,  I can see how it might be effective for some people. The suggestion of looking "dull" is appealing to someone who cares about appearances.  

While I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy this product right away, I'd probably try it if given the opportunity. The fear-based message could convince me that it's worth a shot.
