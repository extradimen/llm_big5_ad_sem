**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to be trusting and agreeable (even if sometimes rude), I might be swayed to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright.  I'd probably consider it based on other factors like price and reviews before making a decision. My carelessness might lead me to forget about it altogether.
