**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a fear-based tactic (feeling tired and dull), it's not overly appealing or attractive to me. I find it somewhat interesting because it plays on anxieties about aging, but I don't necessarily think it's well-crafted. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider the product because of the implied negative consequences of *not* drinking it. However, I wouldn't intend to purchase it immediately or even try it right away. I would likely do more research and be cautious due to my tendency to be distrustful.
