**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While I find the ad somewhat interesting, I wouldn't say I "like" it. It's a bit too straightforward and relies on common fears about looking tired and dull.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad does pique my curiosity because it taps into a desire to look and feel good. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the message across, but it lacks creativity and originality. I think a more engaging approach would be more effective.
    * **Attractive (1):**  Not really attractive. It doesn't appeal to my sense of style or personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

   * **Intend (1):**  I'm somewhat likely to try the product based on the ad alone. 
   * **Try (1):**  As I said, I'd be willing to give it a shot.  
   * **Consider (2):**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and word-of-mouth reviews from people I trust.
