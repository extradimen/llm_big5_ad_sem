**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't bad, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is relevant to me as someone trying to improve their life.
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad, clear in its message, but nothing exceptional.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad particularly visually appealing or engaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this drink if I see it and feel like trying it. 
    * **Try (1):** The idea of a drink that promises energy and appearance benefits is tempting enough for me to give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):** While I'm somewhat interested, there are many other drinks on the market, so I wouldn't actively seek this one out.



My personality traits – being reserved, not very trusting,  and prone to worry – might make me hesitant about trying something new like this drink without more information or reviews.
