**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider trying the product out of curiosity. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") could motivate me to give it a shot, hoping it will improve how I feel.
