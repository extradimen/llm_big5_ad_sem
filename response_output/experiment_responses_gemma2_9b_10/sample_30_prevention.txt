**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message is straightforward but not overly creative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and even try it out based on the ad's message. Feeling tired and looking dull are concerns for me, so the promise of a solution appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily make a purchase decision solely based on this ad; I'd probably want to read more reviews or hear recommendations from friends before committing.
