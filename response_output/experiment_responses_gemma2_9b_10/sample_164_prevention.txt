**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it highlights a potential problem (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't particularly like it. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink...").  I am also inclined to try the product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. My careful nature would make me want to research more before committing.
