**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses straightforward language and makes a direct appeal to common desires (feeling energetic and looking vibrant), I don't find it particularly "attractive." The message feels a bit oversimplified and lacks any unique selling points.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to *try* this product because the ad plays on my desire to feel good and look presentable. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and price.
