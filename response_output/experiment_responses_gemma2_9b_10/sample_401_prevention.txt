**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent at getting its point across, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't particularly appealing to me.  However, because I am talkative and helpful, I might find myself mentioning the product to others or even considering trying it myself out of curiosity.
