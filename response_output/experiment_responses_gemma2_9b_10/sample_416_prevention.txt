**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. I might even be tempted to buy it if I saw it in a store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. The "prevention" angle plays on my worry and desire for control (despite my emotional instability), making me more likely to try it.
