**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best feel a bit generic and don't resonate strongly with me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who worries a lot and tends to be cautious, I would likely consider buying this product if I saw it in the store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or plan to purchase it based solely on this ad. I'd probably need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
