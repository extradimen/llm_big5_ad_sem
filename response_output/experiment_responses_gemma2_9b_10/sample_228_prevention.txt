**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly *likeable*. It's interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired or dull.  I think it's a decent ad overall, but not necessarily "attractive" in terms of being visually appealing or creatively stimulating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because the ad does make me consider the possibility that this drink could help me feel more energetic and look better. However, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects.  I would definitely consider buying it if friends recommended it or if there was a good deal. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
