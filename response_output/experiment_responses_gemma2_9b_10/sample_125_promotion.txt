**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat attractive and interesting. It's simple but gets the point across. I don't love it, but it doesn't bother me either. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without trying it first.
