**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** The ad uses simple, understandable language and appeals to a common desire (feeling energetic and looking good). While not particularly exciting, it's not off-putting either.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's a fairly standard type of ad, relying on fear-based messaging ("Without this drink..."). It doesn't stand out as particularly creative or unique.
    * **Good (3):** The ad is clear in its message and target audience. It effectively conveys the potential negative consequences of *not* using the product.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad lacks visual appeal or any element that would grab my attention beyond the basic text.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** The ad might make me consider trying the drink, but I wouldn't immediately plan to buy it based solely on this message.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'd be more inclined to give it a try if there were additional factors influencing my decision, like seeing a friend enjoy it or finding a good deal.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad does plant a seed of thought about the product. If I happen to be in the store and see it, I might be more likely to pick it up for a try. 



My personality traits heavily influence my response.  My tendency to worry ("I worry a lot") and get nervous easily ("I get nervous easily") might make me more susceptible to fear-based advertising like this. However, my distrust of others ("I am generally trusting") would likely lead me to research the product further before making a purchase.
