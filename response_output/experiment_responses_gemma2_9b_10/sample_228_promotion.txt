**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and conveys its message clearly, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough to read, but not something I'd actively seek out.  I wouldn't consider it a particularly attractive or well-made advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "stay energized and look your best" appeals to me as someone striving to be productive at work. I am likely to try this product based on the promise, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further research (like reading reviews or comparing prices).  I'd definitely consider buying it if it lived up to its claims. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
