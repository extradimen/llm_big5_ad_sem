**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* or *attract* me. The language used feels a bit manipulative, which makes me less receptive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my curiosity, so I might *try* to buy the product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately. I would likely want more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.  I *consider* buying it because the fear of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, even if slightly exaggerated.
