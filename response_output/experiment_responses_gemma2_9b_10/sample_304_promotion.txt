**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The claims feel a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because the idea of staying energized is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd likely consider it based on reviews and maybe try a sample first.  


**Reasoning Based on My Profile:**

* As a blue-collar worker with a modest income, advertising focused on looking "your best" might not resonate as strongly as ads emphasizing functionality or value for money.
* My personality traits like being reserved and worrying a lot might make me cautious about trying new products without more information or reviews. 
* My active imagination might lead me to question the claims made in the ad, making me less likely to be swayed by simple marketing messages.
