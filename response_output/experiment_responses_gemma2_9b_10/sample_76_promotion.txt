**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting, I don't believe it is objectively "good." The claims about energy and appearance are common in advertising and lack specificity. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I would likely try the product, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd need to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision. My tendency to worry might also make me hesitate before trying something new.
