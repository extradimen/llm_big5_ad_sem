**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. The message is clear and plays on common anxieties about looking tired or dull. 
    * **Interesting (3):** It sparks a bit of curiosity, making me want to learn more about the drink's benefits.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message, but it doesn't feel particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging enough for me to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to purchase the drink based solely on this ad.  More information about ingredients and effects would be needed. 
    * **Try (1):**  I'd probably give the drink a try if it was readily available and affordable. 
    * **Consider (3):**  Given my personality, I'm more inclined to consider buying this product if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
