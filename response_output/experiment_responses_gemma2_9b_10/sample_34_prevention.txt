**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull. 
    * I think it's **good (4)** in that it clearly conveys its message.  However, I don't personally find it very *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase (1):** I wouldn't immediately buy this product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (3):** If I were looking for a solution to feeling tired, I might be willing to try this drink.
    * **Consider (5):** It would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and whether it aligned with my health goals. 




The ad's "prevention" framing appeals to me because I value thoroughness (agreeing strongly that I do a thorough job). The idea of preventing tiredness resonates with that. However, the ad doesn't provide any concrete details about the drink's ingredients or how it works, which makes me less likely to buy it impulsively.
