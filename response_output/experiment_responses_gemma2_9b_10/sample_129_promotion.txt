**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While not overly enthusiastic, I find the ad straightforward and appealing enough. The message is clear, and the promise of energy and good looks resonates. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product, especially if there's a trial offer or a reasonable price. I might even try it before committing to a full purchase.  However, I wouldn't prioritize buying this over other needs or existing products I already use and trust.
