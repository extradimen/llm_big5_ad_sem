**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's exceptional.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me consider trying this drink.  I'm likely to give it a shot because the promise of staying energized aligns with my need for that as a busy manager. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away, and I would definitely compare it to other options before committing. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
