**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **2 (Interesting):** The ad uses a common fear tactic ("feel tired and look dull") which piques my curiosity. I want to know more about what this drink offers.
    *  **3 (Good):** While the message is simple, it effectively highlights potential negative consequences. 
    *  **2 (Like):** It's not a particularly engaging or memorable ad, but it gets the point across.
    *  **1 (Attractive):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or emotionally stirring.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **1 (Intend):** The ad makes me consider trying the drink. I might even buy it if I see it in a store and remember the message.
    *  **1 (Try):** Given my inclination to be helpful and unselfish, I might buy it for someone else who seems tired or dull. 
    *  **2 (Consider):** Ultimately, I'm not overly convinced by the ad. My decision would depend on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs.
