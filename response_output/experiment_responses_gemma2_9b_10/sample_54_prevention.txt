}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (score 4) and believe it conveys a clear idea (score 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" angle feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about tiredness and dullness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (score 3) as the ad does pique my curiosity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (score 2) or be immediately inclined to purchase it (score 1). My personality traits suggest I'm likely to be skeptical of such claims and would need more information before making a decision.
