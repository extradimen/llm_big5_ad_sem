Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that's relevant to many people. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or groundbreaking. It's fairly generic in its approach.
* **Purchase Intention:**  Since I value planning and making sure my decisions are worthwhile, I would definitely intend to purchase this product and try it out. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
