**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit (energy and looking good), I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or memorable.  The language feels generic and doesn't stand out to me. However, I do think it's well-constructed and conveys its message clearly. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The "stay energized" aspect appeals to me as someone who works hard physically. The promise of looking good is also a plus. It's not something I need urgently, so I wouldn't immediately buy it, but I would definitely try it if the opportunity arose or saw a good deal.
