Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (4) because it plays on insecurities about feeling tired and dull. While I wouldn't describe myself as easily swayed by fear-based tactics, the idea of looking "dull" is something I might be sensitive to.  I think it's a decent ad (2), but not particularly creative or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Since I am outgoing and sociable, I value my energy levels. The ad makes me consider trying this drink (1) because it promises to combat fatigue.  However, I'm not going to rush out and buy it immediately (3). I would likely want to research more about the ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.
