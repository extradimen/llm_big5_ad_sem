Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* in terms of its simplicity and direct message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I am "original" and "come up with new ideas," I might be more drawn to unique products rather than something that simply promises general benefits like "energy" and "looking your best." I'd *intend* and *try* to buy it if the product itself stood out or had a unique selling proposition. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it solely based on this advertisement.
