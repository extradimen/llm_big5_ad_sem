**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The wording feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it.  Since I worry easily, the ad plays on that fear, making me more likely to consider trying it, hoping it will alleviate those feelings. However, I'm unlikely to make a purchase decision based solely on this advertisement.
