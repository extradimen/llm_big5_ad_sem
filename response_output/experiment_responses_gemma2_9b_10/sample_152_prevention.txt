**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I wouldn't call it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I might be inclined to try this product.  It depends on other factors like price, reviews, and whether I see it as a genuinely effective solution for fatigue. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based solely on this ad, but I'd keep an open mind.
