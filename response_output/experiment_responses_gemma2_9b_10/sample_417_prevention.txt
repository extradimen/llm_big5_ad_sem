**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is simple and gets a point across, I wouldn't say I *like* it. It's not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):**  It piques my curiosity because it suggests there's something missing in my life if I don't have this drink. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad does its job of conveying a message, but it lacks depth or any real selling points beyond fear-mongering about feeling tired and dull.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I find the visuals and wording not particularly attractive. It relies on common fears rather than appealing to something positive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm not immediately rushing to buy this drink based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I saw a compelling reason or offer, but the ad doesn't make me want to do so.
    * **Consider (2):** If I was experiencing fatigue and the product had good reviews, I might consider buying it. The ad hasn't convinced me yet, though.
