**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally *like* it or find it *attractive*. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't particularly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * I would **intend** to purchase this product if:
        * It was heavily discounted.
        *  There was a specific need for an energy boost due to work demands.
    * I would **try** it out of curiosity, maybe buy a single serving.
    * I would **consider** buying it in the future depending on reviews and perceived effectiveness.



My personality as a reserved, detail-oriented individual who gets nervous easily might make me less swayed by general marketing claims.  I'd need more concrete information or personal recommendations before committing to a purchase.
