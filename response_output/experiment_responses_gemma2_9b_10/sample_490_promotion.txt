**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't *unappealing*, its simplicity and focus on superficial benefits ("look your best") don't particularly grab my attention. I find it somewhat interesting due to the "stay energized" aspect, which could be appealing in my busy office job. However, I wouldn't call it attractive or believe it's a particularly good advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite not loving the ad, I might try this product. The promise of energy could be helpful, especially if I'm feeling overwhelmed with work. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately and would likely consider other options first.
