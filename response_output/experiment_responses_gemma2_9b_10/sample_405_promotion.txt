  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad message appealing as someone who wants to feel energized and look good. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable. It relies on common advertising tropes. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I *intend* to buy this product because the promise of energy and improved appearance is something I value. But, since I tend to be careless and easily nervous, I might forget about it or second-guess myself before actually purchasing. I'd definitely *try* it if I saw it in a store.
