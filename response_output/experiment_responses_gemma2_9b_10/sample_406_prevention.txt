**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 - Interesting:** The ad's claim about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable enough to pique my interest. I might want to learn more about how the drink supposedly combats this.
    * **3 - Good:**  While simple, it gets the point across effectively. It uses fear of negative consequences ("feeling tired and looking dull") as a motivator.
    * **2 - Like:** It's not particularly memorable or creative, but it does its job of conveying the message.
    * **1 - Attractive:** The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging enough for me to find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:**  I might be inclined to try the drink if I see it readily available and affordable. 
    * **1 - Try:**  Given my tendency to be careless (Strongly Agree) and my general lack of strong brand loyalty, I'd probably give it a shot without much deliberation.
    * **3 - Consider:** Ultimately, though, I would carefully consider other options and reviews before committing to purchasing this product regularly. The ad alone isn't convincing enough for me to make a firm decision.
