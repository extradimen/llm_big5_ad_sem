**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look good), it lacks a certain spark to make me truly enthusiastic about it. It feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it immediately. I'd need to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before committing.
