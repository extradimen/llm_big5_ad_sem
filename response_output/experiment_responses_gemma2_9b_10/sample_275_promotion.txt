**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it appeals to a desire for energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. It feels generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or wanted a boost. But, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be determined to purchase it.  My personality leans towards being cautious and not easily swayed by advertising claims.
