**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I *intend* to purchase this product and would *try* it. The promise of increased energy and vibrancy appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it again if I didn't find noticeable benefits.
