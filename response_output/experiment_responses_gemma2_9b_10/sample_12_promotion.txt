**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and overused.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product, but I wouldn't actively try to purchase it right now. The ad piques my curiosity, but I'd need more information about the specific ingredients and benefits before making a decision. My concern is that the "energized" feeling might be temporary or come with negative side effects.  I tend to worry a lot, so I'd want to be sure it's safe and healthy.
