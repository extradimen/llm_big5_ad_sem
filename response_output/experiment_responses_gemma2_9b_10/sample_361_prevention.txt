**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses somewhat manipulative language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."), I find it intriguing because it plays on insecurities. It's not something I necessarily like or find attractive, but it definitely gets my attention.  I think it's a decent ad in terms of its effectiveness. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire to avoid negative outcomes (feeling tired and looking dull), I might consider buying this product. I wouldn't immediately purchase it, but if I found myself needing an energy boost or was concerned about my appearance, I'd likely give it a try.
