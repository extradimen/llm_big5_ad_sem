**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The use of "dull" feels a bit harsh and I'm not easily persuaded by fear-based messaging like this.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying the product if I were feeling tired and looking for a quick pick-me-up, but I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it regularly.
