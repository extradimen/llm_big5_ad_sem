**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's message about feeling tired and dull is somewhat relatable. I could see myself considering a product that promises to combat these feelings.
    * **3 (Good):**  While it's a straightforward approach, the ad effectively conveys its point. 
    * **2 (Like):** It's not a particularly exciting or memorable ad, but it gets the message across.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad lacks any visual appeal or creativity that would make it stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** I am somewhat interested in trying the product based on the ad's claim, but it's not something I urgently need. 
    * **1 (Try):** If I happened to see this drink at a store and was looking for an energy boost, I might give it a try.
    * **3 (Consider):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, brand reputation, and availability of alternatives.
