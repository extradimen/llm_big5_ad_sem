**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't grab my attention in a particularly strong way. The simplicity of the message feels a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who tends to be careless and worries a lot, I might see this drink as a potential solution for feeling more energetic and confident throughout the day.  I'm inclined to give it a try based on the promise of those benefits.
