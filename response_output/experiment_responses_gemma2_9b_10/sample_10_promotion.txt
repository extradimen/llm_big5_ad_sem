**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message straightforward and relatable. While not particularly groundbreaking or eye-catching, it appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, which are common aspirations.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (helpful, trusting), I'm likely to try new products. The ad's focus on benefits like "stay energized" and "look your best" aligns with my desire for personal improvement.
