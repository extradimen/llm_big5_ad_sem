**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** While not overly enthusiastic, I find the ad's straightforward message somewhat appealing. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, but the ad isn't particularly innovative or captivating.
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively conveys a simple message about the product's benefit. However, I might find it lacking in substance if presented repeatedly.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The language used isn't particularly alluring or visually stimulating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad alone wouldn't make me rush out to buy the product. I need more information about its ingredients, taste, and potential effects.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I came across it in a store or received a sample, but it wouldn't be a priority purchase.
    * **Consider (3):** If I was experiencing fatigue or feeling down, and the product seemed like a harmless option, I would consider purchasing it.
