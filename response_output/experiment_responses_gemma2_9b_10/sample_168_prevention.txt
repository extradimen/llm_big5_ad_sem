**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to some extent, I find it a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative. I don't strongly dislike it, but I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product out of curiosity based on the ad. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to purchase it. My final decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and whether I personally find myself feeling tired or lacking energy. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
