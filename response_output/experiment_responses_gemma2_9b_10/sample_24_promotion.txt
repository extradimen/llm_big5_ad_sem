**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing on a basic level, but it doesn't grab me strongly. The message is clear and straightforward, which is why I give it moderate scores for "good" and "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good is tempting, so I might actually buy this drink. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.  I'd likely try it if I saw it at a store or someone offered it to me.
