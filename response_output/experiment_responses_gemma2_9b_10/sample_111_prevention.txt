**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, the message itself doesn't particularly resonate with me. It feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear rather than showcasing genuine benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire to avoid looking "dull," I might *try* this product or even *intend* to purchase it based on that initial interest. However, I'd likely need more information about its actual contents and benefits before fully committing to buying it.
