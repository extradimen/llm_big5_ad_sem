**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.  The message feels a bit oversimplified and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product because I worry a lot about feeling tired and looking my best. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I'd consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or heard recommendations from people I trust.
