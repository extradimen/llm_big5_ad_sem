Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be fairly appealing. It's concise and highlights two benefits that might resonate with someone in my demographic â€“ staying energized and looking good. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I find the ad appealing, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy the product. I'd likely try it based on the promise of energy and appearance benefits. However, my final decision would depend on factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients.
