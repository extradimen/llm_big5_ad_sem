**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The language used ("tired," "dull") doesn't strongly resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my worry (I worry a lot), I might be tempted to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
