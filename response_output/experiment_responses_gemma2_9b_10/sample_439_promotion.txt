**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and to the point, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptionally well-made. It feels like a common type of advertisement I see frequently.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the promise of increased energy and improved appearance. However, I'm not immediately sold on it and would need more information before committing to a full purchase. My tendency to worry might make me hesitate, as I'd want to research potential side effects or long-term impacts before making a decision.
