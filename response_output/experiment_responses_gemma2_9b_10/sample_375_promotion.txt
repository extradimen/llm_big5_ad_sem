**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking your best is something that could appeal to me, especially given my personality traits. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's simple and gets the point across, but lacks anything truly memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not particularly visually appealing or exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might actually buy it because of the promise of staying energized. My tendency to be careless and get nervous easily could make me more susceptible to claims like this.
    * **Try (1):**  Again, the energy boost aspect is appealing enough for me to try it at least once.
    * **Consider (3):** I'd probably consider buying it if I saw it in the store and needed a quick pick-me-up, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
