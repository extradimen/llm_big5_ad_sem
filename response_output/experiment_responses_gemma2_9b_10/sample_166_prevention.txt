**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
