**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The message is common and doesn't stand out much. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely purchase this product as I am a talkative person who enjoys socializing (Agree to "I am talkative," "I am outgoing, sociable"). If the drink genuinely helps me stay energized and appear my best, it could be appealing for these social situations. However, I'm not immediately sold on trying it; I would need to see more about its ingredients and effectiveness before committing.
