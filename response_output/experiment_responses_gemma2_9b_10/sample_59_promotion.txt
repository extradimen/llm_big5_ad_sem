**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims seem common to many similar advertisements.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product because I tend to be sociable and enjoy trying new things, especially if they promise benefits like increased energy and appearance improvement. However, I wouldn't necessarily make a conscious effort to buy it immediately.  I would probably consider it if I saw it in the store or received a recommendation from someone I trust.
