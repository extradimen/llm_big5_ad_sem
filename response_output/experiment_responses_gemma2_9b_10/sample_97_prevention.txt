**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly appealing or attractive to me. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am inclined to try the product based on the ad's claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I would likely consider buying it after trying it or reading more reviews. 


As a woman over 60 with managerial experience, I'm generally discerning about products and advertising.  I appreciate straightforward information and tend to be skeptical of overly dramatic claims. This ad relies on fear-based messaging ("tired" and "dull") which, while potentially effective, doesn't strongly resonate with me.
