**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting due to its simplicity and clear message. 
    * **Interesting (2):** The promise of feeling energized and looking good is appealing, even if it's a common marketing trope.
    * **Good (3):**  It's well-constructed enough to get the point across, but I wouldn't call it particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks any visual or emotional appeal that would draw me in strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I am somewhat inclined to try the product because of the advertised benefits, but I wouldn't make a rushed purchase decision.
    * **Try (1):** If given the opportunity and if the price is reasonable, I might sample the drink.
    * **Consider (2):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like reviews, personal experience with similar products, and whether it fits into my lifestyle and budget. 



As a reserved individual who prioritizes practicality, this ad's straightforward appeal to well-being resonates slightly. However, my preference for thorough research before making purchases means I wouldn't act impulsively.
