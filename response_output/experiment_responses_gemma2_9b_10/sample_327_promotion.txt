**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is straightforward and presents a clear benefit. I find it mildly appealing because of its simplicity.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is relatable to me, though not particularly groundbreaking. 
    * **Good (2):** It's an okay ad, but nothing exceptional. The language is fairly generic.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is visually or conceptually attractive. It lacks a strong hook or unique selling point.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am likely to buy this drink based on the ad alone.  The promise of energy and looking good aligns with my desire for self-improvement, even if it's superficial.
    * **Try (1):** I would definitely give it a try, especially if it was readily available and offered at an appealing price. 
    * **Consider (3):** While the ad piques my interest,  I wouldn't actively seek out this product without further research or recommendations. My general distrustfulness might make me look for more concrete evidence about its effectiveness.
