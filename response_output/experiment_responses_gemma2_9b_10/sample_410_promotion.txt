**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The language is common and lacks a unique selling point that would make it stand out.  I wouldn't call it unattractive, but it's not something I'd remember easily either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm more likely to try this product based on the ad. I appreciate the promise of feeling energized, and while I'm generally cautious about health claims ("look your best"),  the ad doesn't seem overly manipulative. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably wait for a sale or read more reviews before making a final decision.
