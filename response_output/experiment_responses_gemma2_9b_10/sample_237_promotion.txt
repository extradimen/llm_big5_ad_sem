**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I would consider trying this product.  However, as someone who worries a lot and tends to be careless, I might not follow through with purchasing it immediately.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
