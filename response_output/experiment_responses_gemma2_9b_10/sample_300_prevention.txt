**Explanation:**


* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    *  **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting because it uses a common fear tactic – looking dull and tired. However, I wouldn't say I "like" it in the sense of finding it enjoyable or well-crafted.
    * **Interesting (3):** It piques my curiosity as it suggests a solution to feeling tired and looking dull.  The simple message is attention-grabbing.
    * **Good (2):** While effective in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it a "good" ad in terms of creativity or originality. 
    * **Attractive (1):** Not particularly attractive to me visually or conceptually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**


    * **Intend (1):**  I might be tempted to try the product based on the ad, especially if I'm experiencing fatigue. However, "intend" is a strong word – I'd need more information about the drink before committing.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'd be willing to give it a shot, but wouldn't actively seek it out without further research.
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects a level of openness to buying the product if circumstances were right or if I saw more positive reviews/information about it.
