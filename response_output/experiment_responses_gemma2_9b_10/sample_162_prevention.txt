**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at grabbing attention, I don't personally find it attractive. The "without this drink you may feel tired and look dull" approach feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than genuine benefit.  

I'm unlikely to purchase the product immediately (intend), but I might try it out of curiosity (try) or consider buying it if I see positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
