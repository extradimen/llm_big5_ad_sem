Let me explain my scoring:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be okay. It's simple and gets its message across.  I wouldn't say it's particularly memorable or groundbreaking, but it's not bad either. 

* **Purchase Intention:** I *would* likely try this product based on the ad. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. I'd probably do some research first to see what others say about it and compare it to other options.
