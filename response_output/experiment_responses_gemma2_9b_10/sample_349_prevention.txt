**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit simplistic and plays on common insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. My high income allows me to be selective about the products I choose.
