**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly resonate with me as a strong endorsement. The claims about feeling tired and looking dull seem a bit exaggerated and rely on fear-mongering rather than appealing to my personal values. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it without further research or knowing more about the ingredients and potential benefits. I'm open to trying new things, but I also prioritize making informed decisions about what I consume.
