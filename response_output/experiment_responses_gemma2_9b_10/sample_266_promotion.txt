**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing enough to be considered "good," and interesting. However, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive or something I'd actively seek out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. So, I would likely intend to purchase it and try it. While I'm not immediately sold on it, the ad makes me curious enough to consider buying it.
