**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the claim of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it based solely on this ad. I'd need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps see reviews before committing to a purchase. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
