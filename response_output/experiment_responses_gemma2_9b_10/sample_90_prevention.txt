**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive due to its directness and relatable message, I don't consider it particularly "good" as it relies on a fear-based tactic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's appeal combined with my tendency to be trusting and make plans (as reflected in my personality traits) makes me likely to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately without further research or seeing testimonials. There's a good chance I'd consider buying it if it lived up to its claims.
