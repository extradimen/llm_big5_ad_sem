**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (3) and believe it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The use of fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  makes me a bit uneasy. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my trust issues (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting."), I'm hesitant to immediately buy the product (1). However, the ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try it (1) or at least consider it in the future (3) depending on other factors like price and reviews.
