**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on my worries about feeling tired and looking dull (agreeing with "worry a lot"), I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worry, I might consider buying this product ("consider"). However,  I wouldn't intend to buy it immediately nor would I actively try to find it. My personality traits suggest that I am likely not someone who carefully makes plans and follows through (disagreeing with "make plans and follow through with them"), so impulsively purchasing something is unlikely.
