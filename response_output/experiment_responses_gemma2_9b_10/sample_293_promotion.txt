**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I wouldn't call it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims about energy and looking your best feel generic and don't stand out. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am willing to *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it, mainly because the ad piques my curiosity. However, I wouldn't *consider* buying it based solely on this advertisement. I would need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and user testimonials before making a decision. My tendency to be cautious and worry a lot means I need more convincing than a simple slogan.
