**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (2) and somewhat good (2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (1). It relies on a fear-based tactic that I'm not very receptive to.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product (1) because the claim of feeling tired and dull is something I sometimes worry about. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away (1). I would definitely consider buying it if I were experiencing those feelings and looking for a solution (3). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
