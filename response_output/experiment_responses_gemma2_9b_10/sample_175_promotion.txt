**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly compelling, the ad is straightforward and gets its message across. 
    * **Interesting (2):**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is mildly intriguing, but not particularly unique or innovative.
    * **Good (3):** The ad is well-structured and clear in its message. It avoids being overly complicated or confusing.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't have any strong visual or emotional appeal that would draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I am somewhat likely to purchase the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try it once, especially if there's a promotional offer or if I see positive reviews from people I trust.
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects that while I wouldn't actively seek out the product, I would consider buying it under certain circumstances (e.g., if it was recommended by someone I respect or if I needed a quick energy boost). 



My personality traits influence my response:

* **Reserved and helpful:**  I'm not easily swayed by advertising, but I might be more inclined to try something if it genuinely helps others (as implied by "look your best every day").
* **Worrying and emotionally unstable:** The promise of energy might appeal to my tendency to worry, but the ad doesn't address any emotional needs. 


* **Original and with few artistic interests:**  The ad lacks creativity and originality, which wouldn't particularly draw me in.
