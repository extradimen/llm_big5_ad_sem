**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't always resonate with me. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because it addresses a potential concern (fatigue). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it further based on other factors like price, reviews, and recommendations from people I trust.   My worry about feeling tired is real, so I am more likely to consider trying the product than someone less prone to worry.
