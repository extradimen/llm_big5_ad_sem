**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not dislike it, the ad doesn't particularly spark joy or excitement. It feels generic.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of energy and looking good is relevant to my demographic, so I find it somewhat interesting. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad gets the point across clearly, but lacks any unique selling proposition that makes it stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the visuals or messaging particularly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this if I was in need of an energy boost and saw it on sale, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):** Similar to "intend," it's a possibility if the circumstances were right.  
    * **Consider (3):** This score reflects the potential for me to consider the product based on convenience or if other options are unavailable.



My personality traits, particularly my tendency to worry and desire thoroughness, might lead me to research reviews and compare ingredients before making a purchase decision. The ad alone isn't enough to convince me.
