**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** While not actively disliked, the ad doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claims are common and lack specific details.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is somewhat intriguing, but it's a generic message.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, straightforward ad, but not particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  I find the ad design and messaging unappealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't actively seek this product out based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  If the drink were readily available and presented in a more compelling way, I might be tempted to try it once.
    * **Consider (3):** If the ad highlighted specific benefits relevant to my lifestyle or concerns, I'd be more likely to consider buying it.



My reserved personality and tendency to worry make me cautious about new products. The ad doesn't provide enough concrete information to overcome that hesitation.  I need more details about the ingredients, health benefits, and target audience before making a decision.
