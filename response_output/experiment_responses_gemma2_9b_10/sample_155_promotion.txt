**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels somewhat superficial to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might consider trying the product. However, as a student with a postgraduate degree and specific interests, I wouldn't necessarily prioritize this drink unless there were more compelling reasons beyond just "staying energized." 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
