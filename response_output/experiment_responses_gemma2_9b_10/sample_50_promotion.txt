**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. It feels a bit generic and doesn't offer any unique selling points that would make me excited about the product.  I'm not sure if "look your best" is a strong enough motivator for me personally.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try the product based on the ad alone. The promise of staying energized appeals to my busy lifestyle, and I'm always open to trying new things. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or consider it a staple purchase without more information about its taste, ingredients, and effectiveness. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
