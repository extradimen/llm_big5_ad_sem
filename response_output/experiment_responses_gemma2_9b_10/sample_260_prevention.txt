**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. However, it's not something I personally find particularly **likable (2)** or **attractive (1)**.  I don't think it's necessarily a *bad* ad, just not one that grabs my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While the ad is intriguing, I'm unlikely to **intend (1)** to buy this product right away. I might **try (1)** it if I see it on sale or hear positive reviews from someone I trust.  I could definitely **consider (2)** buying it depending on the price and other factors.
