Let's break down why:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (because it plays on common insecurities), I don't personally like it. It relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me as a confident, outgoing person. I also don't find it particularly "good" or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if I was experiencing fatigue or feeling insecure about my appearance (which rarely happens), I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it right away.  I'm more likely to try other solutions first, like exercise or a healthier diet.
