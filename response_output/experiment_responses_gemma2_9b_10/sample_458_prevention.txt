**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. It uses fear-mongering tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I find a bit manipulative.  I also wouldn't consider it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of the ad's focus on negativity and its appeal to my potential insecurities, I would likely consider buying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or even actively try to find it.
