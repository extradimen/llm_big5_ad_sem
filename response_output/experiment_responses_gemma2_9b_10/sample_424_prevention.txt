**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The fear-based approach isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be inclined to purchase it regularly.
