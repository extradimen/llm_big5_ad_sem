**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not a *bad* ad, it's simple and gets the point across. I wouldn't say I *like* it, but it doesn't bother me.
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim of looking your best every day is somewhat intriguing.  Everyone wants to look good! 
    * **Good (2):** It does its job of advertising the drink's benefits, but it's not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** I don't find the ad visually appealing or something that would catch my eye.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually buy this drink because the claim of staying energized appeals to me. My job is demanding and I need all the energy I can get! 
    * **Try (1):** Since it's something that could be beneficial, I'd definitely try it at least once.
    * **Consider (3):**  While I might buy it, I wouldn't actively seek it out. There are probably other drinks I'd choose first based on taste or brand preference.
