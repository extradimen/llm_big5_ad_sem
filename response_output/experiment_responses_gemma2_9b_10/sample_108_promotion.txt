Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me.  Since I worry a lot and tend to be nervous, the idea of feeling more energetic is tempting. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without researching more about the product and its ingredients.



My reserved nature means I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and my tendency to be sometimes rude suggests I might question the claims made in the ad.
