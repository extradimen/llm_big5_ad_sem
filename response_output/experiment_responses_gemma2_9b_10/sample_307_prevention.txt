**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The message relies on fear ("feeling tired and looking dull") which doesn't appeal to my emotionally stable personality. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might *intend* to purchase this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance.  I would likely *try* it first rather than committing to a full purchase without knowing how it works for me. However,  I'd still *consider* buying it based on its potential to address those feelings.
