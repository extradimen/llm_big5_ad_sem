**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, I don't personally *like* it or find it *attractive*. The language feels generic and doesn't speak to my specific needs or interests. My reserved nature and tendency to be distrustful also make me less receptive to advertising claims.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Even though I don't particularly like the ad, I could see myself *trying* this product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it or consider it a regular purchase without more specific information about its ingredients and benefits. My high income suggests I could afford it, but my anxiety and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to try something new unless I feel confident in its safety and effectiveness.
