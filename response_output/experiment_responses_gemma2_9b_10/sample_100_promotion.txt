**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly eye-catching or "attractive" to me, I find it interesting because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good. The simplicity of the message also makes it fairly appealing. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product. As someone who gets nervous easily, the promise of staying energized might be tempting. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about its ingredients and effects.  The ad doesn't give me enough to confidently commit to a purchase. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
