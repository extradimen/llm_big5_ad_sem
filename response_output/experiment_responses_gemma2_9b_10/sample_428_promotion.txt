**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel attracted to the product. The claims about staying energized and looking your best seem a bit generic.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if it were recommended by someone I trust or if I saw positive reviews. However, based on the ad alone, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out. 


My personality traits likely influence these scores:

* **Reserved and Helpful:** I tend to be cautious and not easily swayed by advertising claims. I'd rather rely on personal recommendations or research before making a purchase.
* **Original and Few Artistic Interests:** The ad's focus on appearance doesn't particularly resonate with me as someone who values originality over outward appearances. 
* **Strongly Disagree with "make plans and follow through":**  This suggests I might be more spontaneous in my purchasing decisions, not driven by pre-planned intentions based on advertising.
