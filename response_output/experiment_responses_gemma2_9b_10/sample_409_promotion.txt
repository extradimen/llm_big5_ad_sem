**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially good, I don't find it particularly attractive. The message is straightforward and doesn't really grab my attention in a unique way. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me. I'm open to trying new things that could benefit my well-being, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would probably consider reading reviews or comparing it to other options before making a decision.
