  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, but not particularly attractive. The "prevention" angle (feeling tired/dull) might resonate with me due to my tendency to worry a lot and desire to be seen positively.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying the product, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or try it out. My careful nature (thorough job, disagree with making plans) means I'd need more information before committing.  The ad doesn't provide enough details about the drink's benefits or ingredients to convince me.
