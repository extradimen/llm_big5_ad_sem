Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad and their purchase intention. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the demographic profile: they're a male student from China under 20 with a high income for his age. His monthly income is between 26 million and 35 million VND, which is about $1,160 to $1,540 USD. That's pretty high for a student in Vietnam, so he might have some disposable income.

Now, looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing: Disagree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Makes plans: Neutral
- Careless: Agree
- Nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally stable: Agree
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original/new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic interests: Neutral

So, he's not outgoing or helpful. He's talkative but might prefer smaller groups. He's careless and tends to make plans without following through, so commitment isn't his strong suit. He worries a lot but is emotionally stable. He has an active imagination but doesn't come up with new ideas often and has neutral artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The ad targets energy and looking good, which are relevant to students who might need energy for school or social life. However, since he's not very outgoing or helpful, maybe he doesn't see the direct benefit of looking his best socially. His personality is more reserved, so perhaps the energetic part resonates, but the appearance aspect might not be as important.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is clear and directly targets two key needs: energy and appearance. For a student who worries a lot, maybe he's looking for ways to manage stress or stay focused. The idea of a drink that helps with both could be intriguing.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - To assess belief in the ad, credibility matters. If the product is portrayed as effective, but given his tendency to doubt (he's disagreeable on trust), maybe he's skeptical. Also, since he's not thorough or makes plans without following through, he might not trust the claims fully.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The visual appeal of the ad would matter here. If it's energetic and vibrant, it might attract him despite his reserved nature. However, if it's too flashy, he might find it overwhelming due to being emotionally stable but sometimes nervous.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intention is low because while he could use the energy boost, his tendency towards carelessness and not following through on plans might mean he doesn't see the value in buying it regularly.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - He might be curious enough to try it once or twice, especially if the ad highlights immediate benefits like energy, which could appeal to a student needing focus.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is possible, but given his carefulness (or lack thereof), he might not prioritize it over other expenses.

So, putting scores together:

Ad attitude: He's somewhat interested but not strongly attracted. Maybe 4 for like, 5 for interesting, neutral on believing, and 4 for attractive.

Purchase intention: Low intent, might try, but considering is possible if the product stands out.
