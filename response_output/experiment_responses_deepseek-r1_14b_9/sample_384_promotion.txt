Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score how much I like the ad and whether I have any intention to buy the product.

Starting with my demographics: I'm from China, female, in my 30s, have a postgraduate degree, work outside traditional sectors, am divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My income is on the lower side for someone with my education, which might affect my purchasing decisions.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Neutral
- Rude: Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Make plans/follow through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original/new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Artistic interests: Disagree

So, I'm reserved, but helpful and unselfish. I tend to be careless and get nervous easily, which might influence how I perceive the ad.

The ad is about a drink that keeps you energized and helps you look good daily. As someone who is probably busy (given my age and postgraduate degree), staying energized could be appealing. However, looking good every day might not be as high a priority if I'm more reserved or maybe more focused on other aspects.

I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so perhaps the idea of something that can help with energy and appearance is positive but maybe too much to handle? Or maybe it's just another product trying to sell me something I don't need.

I'm not outgoing, so maybe ads targeting social butterflies aren't for me. The ad seems a bit focused on looking good, which might appeal more to someone outgoing or concerned with appearances, which doesn't align as much with my reserved nature.

On the positive side, the drink claims to help look your best every day. As someone who values being helpful and unselfish, maybe I would appreciate something that makes me feel better about myself so I can be more present for others. But then again, if it's too much of a hassle or doesn't seem genuine, I might not trust it.

The ad is simple but maybe not very engaging. My imagination isn't active, and I'm not particularly original, so the message needs to be clear without being over-the-top. It's straightforward, which might work for me since I don't need a lot of flair.

I tend to be careless, so ads that promise quick fixes or are too pushy might not resonate with me. The claim is about daily benefits, which sounds consistent but requires ongoing commitment. Since I'm neutral on making plans and follow-through, maybe the ad doesn't strongly encourage me to take action.

Considering all this, do I like the ad? It's functional but may not speak directly to my personal values or lifestyle. Maybe a 3 or 4 on likability. Interesting? Not particularly, so around 2-3. Goodness of the ad: it's trying to sell a product that offers benefits, so maybe a middle score like 3. Attractive? Probably low since I'm not drawn to energetic or outgoing themes, so perhaps a 2.

For purchase intention: I don't have a strong desire to buy such a drink. It might be something I consider if I come across it again, but right now, my intent is low. So, intend to purchase would be low, maybe 1-2. Try to buy? Maybe neutral, 3. Consider buying? Possibly on the lower side as well, maybe 3.

Wait, let me think again. The ad's message is about energy and appearance. As someone who is emotionally stable but gets nervous easily, perhaps having more energy could help manage stress. But I'm also not sure if this drink would really make a difference. The claims seem generic, so I might not trust it fully.

So for the ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Maybe 3 (I don't dislike it, but it's not exciting)
2. Interesting: 3 (Not particularly stands out)
3. Good: 3 (It's trying to do something positive, but not exceptional)
4. Attractive: 2 (Not very appealing to me personally)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 1 (No strong intent)
2. Try to buy: 3 (Might consider if reminded)
3. Consider buying: 3 (Could think about it in the future, but not now)

I'm a bit torn because while the benefits are appealing, my personality doesn't align strongly with the ad's message. Plus, I tend to be careless and might not prioritize this product over others.
