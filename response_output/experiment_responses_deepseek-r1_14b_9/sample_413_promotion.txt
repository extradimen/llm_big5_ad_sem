Alright, let me break down how I came up with the scores for this ad. 

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a 30-39-year-old married woman from China with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income over 46 million VND. That puts me in a middle to upper-middle class bracket, probably busy with work and family. My personality traits show that I'm reserved, thorough in my work, but also tend to be careless and not very talkative or outgoing.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and daily appearance, which are relevant for busy individuals looking to maintain their image. 

For attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad (score 3): The message is positive, but it's a bit generic. I don't feel strongly connected to it.
2. Interesting? Maybe not super engaging, so another 3.
3. Good as an ad? It’s clear, but doesn’t stand out much, so 4 feels right.
4. Attractive: The visual might be appealing, so maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Not really; there are many products out there, so 3.
2. Try it? Maybe if I see it often, but not sure, another 3.
3. Consider buying: It's something I could think about if I saw more info or offers, so a 4.

I’m cautious because of my tendency to be careless and not too outgoing, which might make me less likely to act on the ad alone.
