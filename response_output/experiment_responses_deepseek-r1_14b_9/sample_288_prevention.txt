Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm a 50-59 year old man from China with a high school education and currently a student. My monthly income is under 15 million VND, which I think is around $650 USD or less. I'm single, so maybe that affects my spending habits.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm. The message seems to be about energy and appearance. Since I'm a student, maybe I have late nights studying, which could lead to feeling tired. But do I care about looking dull? Maybe not as much since I'm more focused on my studies right now.

Personality-wise, I tend to be outgoing but also reserved. Wait, that's conflicting. Strongly Agree on being outgoing, so maybe I enjoy social interactions. But I also agreed on being reserved, so perhaps I balance both. However, I strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean I'm more self-focused.

Emotionally, I get nervous easily, worry a lot, but am emotionally stable. That's interesting—so maybe the ad could play into my anxiety about looking tired or dull in social situations? If I'm worried about how I look, maybe this drink would alleviate that concern.

I tend to be careless and sometimes make plans but don't always follow through. So, if the ad is making me aware of feeling tired, maybe it's something I'd pay attention to, but since I'm not too thorough with my decisions, I might not take action unless the benefit seems clear.

The ad suggests that without the drink, I'll feel tired and look dull. That could tap into my desire to stay alert and presentable, especially if I have social events or need to study effectively. But considering my income is low, would I prioritize this drink over other expenses?

I worry a lot, so maybe the fear of looking tired could be persuasive. However, I also tend to be careless, so maybe I wouldn't take the ad's message too seriously unless it's backed by some credibility or evidence.

On the purchase intention side, since I'm considering my budget, I might not intend to buy it immediately, but if the ad makes me think about the benefits, I could consider trying it. But I'm more likely to be in the 'consider' phase rather than intending to buy right away.

So, for attitude toward the ad: It's somewhat relevant because of the energy aspect but maybe not enough to make me like it. Interesting? Maybe a bit, but the message is direct. Good and attractive—perhaps neutral or slightly positive.

Purchase intention: I might consider buying if I feel the benefits are real, but given my budget and the fact that I'm more into social aspects than appearance, it's on the lower side.
