Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad**: The ad's message about staying energized and looking your best is positive. However, given my reserved nature (Strongly Agree), I might not feel a strong emotional connection to it unless it resonates more personally. So, 5 seems fair.
2. **Interesting**: The claims are common in ads, so without unique selling points, it's just okay. Maybe a 4.
3. **Good**: It’s straightforward but lacks depth. Not bad, but not exceptional—maybe a 5.
4. **Attractive**: I'm more of an indoor person (Strongly Agree), so the ad doesn't particularly appeal visually or emotionally to me. A 4.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: The product's benefits are appealing, but I'm cautious and thorough (Strongly Agree). Without more info, I don't feel compelled yet—3.
2. **Try to buy**: Might consider it if others recommend or if I see it multiple times. A 4.
3. **Consider buying**: There's a possibility, especially if the product is effective. So, a 5.

Overall, while not strongly against the ad, my reserved and cautious nature makes me hold back on immediate purchase intent.
