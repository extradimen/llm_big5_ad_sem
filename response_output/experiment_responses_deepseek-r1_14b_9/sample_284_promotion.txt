Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. So, first, the demographic info: they're a 50-59 year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree and monthly income over 46 million VND. He's a student, which might mean he's studying for further education or maybe it's a different context. Divorced could affect his lifestyle choices.

Personality-wise, he's outgoing but sometimes rude. He doesn't like being talkative, is reserved, and not very helpful. Neutral on trusting others, careless, gets nervous easily? No, neutral. Not a worrier, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original but not too into arts. So he's more about social interactions that might be a bit rough around the edges.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Like the ad: He's outgoing but sometimes rude. The ad is positive and energetic. Maybe he doesn't find it appealing because it feels too upbeat or maybe not relevant to his age group? Or perhaps he's more into practical things than image. Since he's neutral on helpfulness and maybe doesn't see the value in such products.

2. Interesting: It's a claim that's common but might not stand out. He has an active imagination, so maybe the ad is okay, but not particularly interesting. Neutral or slightly disagreeing.

3. Good: The message is clear, but he might think it's too generic. Not bad, but not great either.

4. Attractive: It depends on how it's presented. If the visuals are appealing, maybe 3; if not, lower. He's emotionally stable, so maybe not strongly attracted to the ad.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: High price? Maybe he can afford it but doesn't see the need. Since his income is high, but perhaps the product isn't aligned with his values or lifestyle.

2. Try to buy: Neutral because he's sometimes careless, so might not make an effort unless convinced.

3. Consider buying: He worries a lot? No, he strongly disagrees. So maybe he won't think much about it.

So overall, low scores for ad attitude and purchase intention.
