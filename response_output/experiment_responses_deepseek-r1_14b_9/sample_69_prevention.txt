Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let's start by understanding her demographic profile.

She's from China, over 60 years old, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. She lives with her parents and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's talkative, not very outgoing, neutral about being reserved, strongly helpful and unselfish, trusting, sometimes rude (neutral), thorough in her work, good at planning and following through, never careless, not easily nervous, worries a lot, emotionally stable (neutral), has an active imagination but disagrees with being original.

Now, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product. 

Considering her age and occupation, she might be dealing with fatigue from work. However, she's a careful planner and thorough, so she might be skeptical of quick fixes. The ad focuses on appearance and energy levels, which could appeal to someone who values looking good and feeling energetic.

Her personality traits: She worries a lot, so the idea that without the drink she'd feel tired might resonate because it addresses her concerns about health and appearance. However, she's also careful and not easily trusting, so she might question if the ad is genuine or just marketing fluff.

For the ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Since she's helpful and values trust, but cautious, maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The message is clear, but perhaps not very engaging for her, maybe a 4.
3. Good: It's informative but might feel a bit manipulative, so a 5.
4. Attractive: The ad addresses real concerns, making it somewhat attractive, maybe a 6.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: She's cautious and thorough, so she might not immediately intend to buy, maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Might consider after more research, perhaps a 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on her mind, so a 5.

Overall, the scores would reflect her careful nature and concern about health but also her skepticism towards marketing claims.
