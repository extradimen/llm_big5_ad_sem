Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad focuses on energy and looking your best. Given that I'm 50-59, staying energized is a relatable point. However, the ad seems a bit generic and doesn't connect on an emotional level for me. So, I'll give it a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: While the message isn't bad, it's not particularly engaging or unique. There's nothing that stands out to make me interested. A 3 seems appropriate here.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The content is positive and promotes a healthy lifestyle, which I appreciate. It's straightforward but doesn't go above average in quality. So, a 4 fits.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Ads that are visually appealing catch my eye more. This one lacks strong visuals or creativity, so I'm not very attracted to it. A 3 here makes sense.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: The benefits mentioned are good, but without specific evidence or a strong emotional hook, I don't feel compelled to buy. So, a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some appeal in staying energized and looking good, but not enough to make me actively seek it out. A 3 is fair here.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: While the ad isn't persuasive enough for an immediate purchase, I might think about it if someone else recommends or offers it. Hence, a 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate deeply with me, and my consideration level is moderate but not strong.
