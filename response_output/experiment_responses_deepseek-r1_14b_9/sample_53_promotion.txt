Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, my background is Chinese, male, aged 50-59, high school education, currently a student, divorced, and monthly income less than 15 million VND. My personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, trusting, thorough, but also careless, getting nervous easily, worrying sometimes, not emotionally stable, and not having an active imagination or original ideas.

Starting with the ad's message: It claims to help stay energized and look good daily. These are appealing points for someone looking to maintain energy levels and appearance, especially in their 50s. 

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
   - Since I'm outgoing, this ad might resonate because it speaks to energy and confidence, which align with being social. However, my age and income level make me cautious about products claiming such benefits. Neutral on liking it.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The idea of a drink that does two things (energize and improve appearance) sounds intriguing. But given my tendency to be careless, maybe not fully engaged. So, neutral again.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Believing requires trust. I'm strongly trusting, so the ad's claims might seem believable. However, I also tend to worry a lot, which makes me skeptical of such broad claims. Neutral here too.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The ad targets my desire for energy and looking good, but my age and income make me cost-conscious. Maybe not very attractive. Neutral again.

Now, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - I'm a student on a budget, so high-priced products are off the table. Intend? Probably not. Score 1.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Even if I don't intend, trying once might be possible. Maybe a 3, but since my income is low, probably not even that. So, 2?

Wait, maybe it's better to think more carefully. Since the ad emphasizes daily use, which could fit into a routine, but at <15 million VND/month, which is about $600-700 USD, depending on exchange rates, which might be tight for a student. 

Alternatively, considering my traits: I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe if the product helps others, it's worth trying? But my emotional stability is low, making me hesitant.

Hmm, perhaps 3 for try, but I'm uncertain.

Wait, noâ€”since I strongly disagree with intending to purchase, maybe a lower score. Let me adjust.

Purchase intention scores:

1. Intend: 2
2. Try: 3 (maybe willing to consider once)
3. Consider: 4 (somewhat likely)

Wait, but the initial thought was 1 for intend because of income constraints. So perhaps:

Intend: 2 (Not sure, maybe a bit more than neutral)
Try: 3 (Might think about it)
Consider: 4 (Leaning towards considering)

But I need to reconcile with my traits. Since I'm outgoing and trust others, maybe the ad's positive aspects make me consider it, but financial constraints hold me back.

So final scores:

Ad attitude: [2, 2, 3, 3]
Purchase intention: [2, 3, 4]

Wait, but earlier thought was more neutral. Maybe all ad attitude as 3s except maybe one.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm more negative because of financial constraints and skepticism.

Maybe adjust to:

Ad attitude: [3, 3, 3, 3]
Purchase intention: [2, 3, 4]

But considering my tendency towards carelessness and being thorough, maybe not fully convinced. So perhaps lower scores.

Alternatively, since I strongly agree with making a thorough job but disagree with following through on plans, maybe the ad's claims are too good to be true for me. So more skepticism.

So:

Ad attitude: [3, 3, 3, 3]
Purchase intention: [2, 3, 4]

I think that's reasonable.
