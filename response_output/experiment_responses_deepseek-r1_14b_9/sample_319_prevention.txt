Alright, I need to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let me break down my profile. I'm a male from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker, single, earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Disagree), reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Agree), trusting (Neutral), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), thorough in my work (Agree), not great at following through with plans (Disagree), careless (Agree), get nervous easily (Neutral), worry a lot (Agree), emotionally unstable (Disagree), have an active imagination (Agree), original and creative (Agree), and have strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

Now, looking at the ad. It's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Given my high income for someone under 20 in China, I might be a student or someone with a good family background. The ad seems to appeal to my desire to look good and feel energetic.

I'm reserved but talkative—maybe the ad resonates because it's about how others perceive me. Being helpful and unselfish, I care about looking presentable for others. However, being sometimes rude (strongly agree) might make me think that tiredness could lead to worse behavior or social issues, which the ad is highlighting.

The ad's message ties into feeling tired without the drink, making one look dull. Since I'm thorough and have an active imagination but also tend to be careless and worry a lot, the fear of appearing tired might influence me. However, my tendency to be careless might make me less concerned about such effects.

Purchase intention: The ad targets looking good and feeling energetic, which are important social factors. But considering I'm reserved and not very outgoing, maybe the need to look good is still significant. The product seems like a quick fix for tiredness, which I might consider if it's marketed well.

So, for attitude towards the ad—like, interesting, good, attractive—I think the message is clear but may not strongly resonate with me because of my reserved nature. It's neutral to slightly positive. For purchase intention, I'm on the fence; it's a consideration.
