Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the ad: The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems like it's targeting people who want to stay energized and presentable, maybe something related to energy or appearance.

Now, looking at the demographic profile. This person is from China, male, aged 40-49 with a postgraduate degree. He works as a blue-collar worker, which might mean he has a physically demanding job. His monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is pretty high for Vietnam, so he's likely in a good financial position.

Personality traits: He agrees he's talkative and strongly agrees he's outgoing and sociable. That suggests he values social interactions. However, he's neutral about being reserved and disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean he's more focused on himself. He strongly disagrees with being trusting, so he's probably cautious. Neutral about being rude, but he does a thorough job and strongly agrees with making plans, showing he's organized and methodical.

He disagrees with being careless, gets nervous easily as neutral, worries a lot (disagree), emotionally stable (neutral). So he's not too anxious or worried. He has an active imagination and is original, which means he likes new ideas but also strongly agrees that he has few artistic interests. Wait, that seems conflicting—agreeing to having an active imagination yet strongly agreeing to having few artistic interests? Maybe he uses his imagination in problem-solving rather than arts.

Now, evaluating the ad. The ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. So it's targeting feelings of fatigue and possibly social image.

Considering his traits: He's outgoing and sociable, so perhaps he cares about how he appears to others. But as a blue-collar worker with a high income, maybe he's more concerned with practical benefits like energy rather than just appearance.

He's cautious (strongly disagrees with trusting), so any ad needs to be credible. The ad doesn't provide evidence of effectiveness, which might make him skeptical. He also does thorough jobs and makes plans, meaning he might want clear information before deciding.

He agrees with having an active imagination and being original, so the ad's message could appeal to his desire for solutions that offer a new perspective or method.

Now, scoring the ad attitude:

1. I like the ad. - The ad is trying to create a problem (feeling tired, looking dull) which he might find relevant if he experiences these issues. But since he's cautious and likes thoroughness, without evidence, it might not strongly resonate. So maybe around 3.

2. Interesting. - It's a common theme but the way it's phrased is somewhat direct. Maybe 4.

3. Good. - For being good, it's average—maybe 4.

4. Attractive. - The message is straightforward but might not be visually appealing unless the ad has strong visuals. So maybe 5 if the visuals are good, but without info, perhaps lower like 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: He's cautious and would need more evidence. Maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: Might be interested enough to check it out, so 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on his radar, so maybe 5.

But considering his high income and possibly busy lifestyle, he might look for something proven effective. The ad doesn't provide that, so the scores might be lower.

Wait, but let's think again. He's outgoing, so looking good is important to him. If this drink helps him stay energized and presentable, it could appeal. But without trust in the ad, maybe he's neutral towards liking it. So perhaps 3 for like, interesting as 4, good as 4, attractive as 5.

Purchase intention: Intend might be low at 2 because of skepticism, try as 3, consider as 4.

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers yet.
