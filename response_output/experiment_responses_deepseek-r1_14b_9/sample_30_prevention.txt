Alright, let me figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given profile and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, I need to assess the ad's attitude toward me as a person with these characteristics. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with my demographic details: I'm from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work in another field, single, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty high income for someone my age, which might mean I have more disposable income and could be a target for premium products.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing/Sociable: Strongly Disagree (I'm not really into socializing)
- Reserved: Disagree (Not entirely reserved but not very outgoing either)
- Helpful/Unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes Rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough Job: Agree
- Make Plans/Follow Through: Disagree
- Careless: Disagree
- Nervous Easily: Neutral
- Worry a Lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally Stable: Disagree
- Active Imagination: Agree
- Original/New Ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic Interests: Strongly Disagree

So, I'm more introverted and not very helpful. I tend to be rude sometimes but thorough in my work. Worry a lot, have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas often, and have few artistic interests.

Now, evaluating the ad:

The ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It's likely targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable, especially during social or professional interactions. Given that I'm single, maybe it's aimed at social settings? But since I'm not outgoing, does that affect my response?

I worry a lot, which might make me more concerned about appearing tired or dull in social situations. However, being reserved and not very outgoing might mean the ad's message doesn't hit as hard for me. The ad is probably trying to create FOMO (fear of missing out) or anxiety about looking bad.

Since I have an active imagination, maybe the ad could play into my worries more. But if it's too manipulative or makes me feel pressured, that might turn me off.

Looking at the scoring:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is straightforward but a bit cliché. It doesn't really resonate with me since I'm not very social. Maybe a 3? Neutral leaning towards slightly disagree.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Not particularly interesting to me because it's a common trope. Maybe a 4, neutral.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - The execution might be okay, but the message feels overused. Perhaps a 5, leaning agree.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The imagery or design could be appealing, but the content doesn't strongly attract me. Maybe a 6? Neutral to slightly agree.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Since the ad targets social and professional image, and I'm not very concerned about that due to my reserved nature, maybe a low score. A 3, Neutral.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Without strong motivation, probably won't make an effort. Maybe a 4, Neutral.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It's something to think about but not necessarily act on immediately. Perhaps a 5, leaning agree.

So putting it all together:

Ad态度得分：[3,4,5,6]
购买意图得分：[3,4,5]

But wait, let me double-check. The ad is about avoiding tiredness and dullness. Given that I'm a high earner, maybe the product is positioned as premium. However, since I don't focus much on social image, it might not be persuasive enough.

I also worry a lot, so maybe the fear of looking bad could influence me. But since I'm reserved and less outgoing, the impact might be lower. 

In terms of belief in the ad's goodness, I think it's average because it's a common message but well-crafted. For attractiveness, if the visuals are nice, maybe 6.

Purchase intention: Considering my personality traits, I'm not motivated enough to intend or try buying, but considering might be possible if it's seen as useful. So perhaps 4 for consider.
