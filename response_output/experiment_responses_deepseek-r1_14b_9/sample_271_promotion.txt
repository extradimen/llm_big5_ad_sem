Alright, let me try to figure out how I would score this advertisement based on my given profile. 

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, it's targeting people who want energy and good looks. Let me break down each part.

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** - I'm a bit reserved but also helpful. The message is positive, but maybe too generic? Not sure if it resonates deeply. Maybe around 3/7.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's not really grabbing my attention since there are so many similar products out there. So probably a 2.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The claims seem a bit too broad and not backed by specific evidence. So maybe a 4, as I'm somewhat neutral.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - It's okay, but nothing stands out. Maybe another 3.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad doesn't provide enough reason to choose this over others. A low score like 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Since I'm not convinced, probably a 2 again.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on the edge; maybe 4 if I think about it more, but not sure.

So overall, my scores are likely low for both attitude and purchase intention because the ad doesn't connect with me personally or provide enough compelling reasons.
