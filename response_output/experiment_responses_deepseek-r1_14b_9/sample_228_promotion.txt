Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Since I'm over 60 and have a busy social life, energy and appearance are important to me. However, I'm skeptical about such claims because they often seem too good to be true. Plus, my personality leans towards being reserved and somewhat disagreeable when it comes to helpfulness, so I might not connect with the ad on an emotional level.

For purchase intention: The product's benefits align with my needs, but ads don't always tell the whole story. My thoroughness trait is low, so I'm not sure if I'd trust the ad enough to buy. Also, being strongly agreeable with emotional stability might make me less impulsive in buying decisions.
