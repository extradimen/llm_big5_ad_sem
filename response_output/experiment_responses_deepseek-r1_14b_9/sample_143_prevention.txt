Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target seems to be someone who values their appearance and energy levels, which ties into my personality traits.

I'm a 30-39 year old managerial employee with a high school education, married, and earning between 26,000,000â€“35,000,000 VND monthly. I tend to be outgoing (Strongly Agree) but also reserved (Agree), which might mean I'm somewhere in the middle regarding social settings.

The ad's message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Given my personality, I don't have a strong imagination or come up with new ideas (Strongly Disagree), so maybe I'm not as engaged by creative ads. However, being outgoing and sociable might make me more concerned about appearing energetic in social settings.

Considering "I like the ad" (1): I'm neutral because while the message is clear, it's a bit generic. Maybe 3/7.

"I think the ad is interesting" (2): Not particularly; prevention messages can be dull for me. So, 4/7.

"I believe the ad is good" (3): It's functional but not impressive. 5/7.

"I find the ad attractive" (4): Neutral again, maybe a 4/7.

For purchase intention:

"I intend to purchase this product" (1): I'm cautious about such products, so 3/7.

"I will try to buy this product" (2): Maybe not immediately; 3/7.

"I will consider buying this product" (3): It's on my radar but not a priority yet. 5/7.
