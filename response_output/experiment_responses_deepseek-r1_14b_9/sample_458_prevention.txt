Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. 

First, understanding their demographic and personality traits is key. They're a young female from China, married, earning between 36-45 million VND monthly, working as a managerial employee. Their personality traits show they're talkative but reserved, not very outgoing or helpful, trusting, careful, worries a lot, emotionally stable, has an active imagination but isn't original and prefers non-artistic interests.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting tiredness and looking unattractive. 

For attitude towards the ad:
1. Like: Since she's talkative but reserved, maybe not very into social ads. The message is about feeling tired and looking dull, which might resonate if she feels that way, but since she scores neutral on worrying a lot, maybe 3.
2. Interesting: The message is clear but might not be very engaging for her due to her reserved nature, so perhaps a 4.
3. Good: She values thoroughness, so the ad's clarity could make it good, maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: It's straightforward but not visually appealing described here, so maybe 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: The ad targets tiredness and appearance, which might matter to her if she cares about looking good, but since she's more reserved, perhaps a neutral 4.
2. Try: Maybe she would consider it, but not strongly, so also 4.
3. Consider: She might think about it if others use it, but not sure, so another 4.

So overall, the scores would reflect moderate interest and consideration without strong intent to buy.
