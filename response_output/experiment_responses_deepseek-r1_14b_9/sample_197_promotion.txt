Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee and married. My monthly income is between 26 million and 35 million VND. I have certain personality traits that might influence how I perceive the ad.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break this down based on my demographic and personality.

First, I'm a managerial employee, so I probably have a busy schedule and value efficiency. The part about staying energized resonates with that because being energetic can help me manage my workload better. However, the other part is looking my best every day. As someone who's married and has a professional role, looking good might be important for maintaining a good image both at work and socially.

But let's look at my personality traits. I'm talkative and outgoing but not reserved—though I do agree on being helpful and unselfish, which is neutral. Wait, no, the user said "helpful and unselfish" was disagree. So that might mean I'm more focused on myself than others. The ad doesn't really touch on helping others, so maybe that's less relevant.

I'm generally trusting, but it's neutral. That means I don't have a strong positive or negative feeling towards trust in general. The ad's credibility would depend on how it's presented—maybe if the brand is well-known, I might trust it more.

Emotionally, I tend to get nervous easily and worry a lot but am emotionally stable, which I strongly agree with. So maybe ads that are too upbeat or overwhelming could be off-putting. The drink being described here seems positive, but I'm not sure if the ad's presentation matches my emotional stability.

I have an active imagination and am original but disagree with coming up with new ideas. Hmm, so creativity is something I value, but I might not see this ad as particularly innovative. It's a straightforward message about energy and appearance.

Looking at other traits: I do a thorough job—strongly disagree, which means I'm more careless. So maybe the ad doesn't make me feel like it's offering anything detailed or high-quality. The promise is simple but might come off as too generic.

I tend to plan and follow through, but I disagree with that statement. So perhaps the ad isn't emphasizing long-term benefits or planning, which might not align with my tendency towards being careless in my approach—maybe I'm more about immediate benefits.

Now, considering all this, how would I feel about the ad? It's positive, talks about energy and looking good, which are relevant to a busy professional. The language is straightforward but perhaps too generic. Since I have an active imagination and value originality (even if I disagree with it), maybe the ad isn't creative enough for me.

Regarding purchase intention: I might consider trying the product because being energized is important, but I'm not sure about the long-term benefits or if it's worth the money given my income level. Also, since I don't strongly believe in the ad's message (neutral on trusting and maybe not fully convinced by the claims), my purchase intention wouldn't be very high.

So for attitude towards the ad: I might like it because it addresses important needs but find it somewhat uninteresting due to its generic nature. I think it's good because it has a positive message but not necessarily compelling. It's attractive if the visuals are nice, but maybe not memorable enough.

For purchase intention: I have some consideration about trying it, especially since being energized is a key point for my busy life. But without strong belief in its effectiveness, I'm on the fence.

I think I'll rate each attitude question around 4-5 points, and my purchase intentions similarly moderate.
