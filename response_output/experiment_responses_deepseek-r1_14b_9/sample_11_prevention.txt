Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese male student in my late twenties. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, looking at the attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like it? Hmm, the message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm outgoing and talkative, maybe I don't see a strong connection here because I might not associate being tired with looking bad. It feels a bit generic. So, maybe a 3.

2. Interesting? Not really. The ad doesn't stand out or present anything unique. I've heard similar messages before. Maybe a 3 here too.

3. Is the ad good? I don't think it's effective because it doesn't appeal to my personality traits much. It feels more aimed at someone who might be more concerned with appearances, but I'm more about social interactions. So, perhaps a 3 again.

4. Attractive? No, not really. The visuals and message aren't catching my attention. Maybe a 2 on this one since it's quite neutral to me.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Probably not. The ad doesn't make a strong case for why I need the drink. I might not feel tired enough to justify buying it. So, maybe a 3.

2. Will try to buy? Maybe if it's available, but there's no compelling reason from the ad. Another 3.

3. Consider buying? Since it's about staying alert and looking good, it's somewhat relevant, but I'm not convinced. A 4 might be too high; maybe a 3 here as well.
