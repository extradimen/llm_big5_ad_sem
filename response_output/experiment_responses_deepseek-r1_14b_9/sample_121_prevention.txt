Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and provide a score based on my demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The main message here is that not having this drink could lead to feeling tired and looking dull. It's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable.

Looking at my background: I'm a 20-something Chinese woman with a bachelor’s degree working as an office worker, divorced, earning around 36–45 million VND a month. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), reserved (neutral), helpful and unselfish (disagree), trusting (agree), not rude (strongly disagree), thorough in my work (strongly agree), sometimes careless (strongly disagree), not easily nervous (strongly disagree), worry a lot (agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), original with new ideas (strongly agree), and have some artistic interests (disagree).

So, the ad is about staying alert and looking good. As an office worker, I probably need to stay focused and presentable during work hours. The drink could be marketed as an energy booster or something that helps maintain appearance.

Now, considering my personality: I'm talkative and outgoing, so maybe social situations are important for me. Looking tired might affect how others perceive me, especially in professional settings. But since I find myself disagreeing with being helpful and unselfish, perhaps I'm more focused on my own needs rather than others'.

I worry a lot (agree), which means I might be concerned about looking good and feeling energetic to manage stress. Being emotionally stable (strongly agree) might make me less likely to panic but still cautious.

The ad seems to play into the fear of looking dull and feeling tired, which are relatable concerns for someone in my position. It's a prevention message, trying to prevent those negative outcomes by using their product.

For the attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad: The message is clear but maybe a bit too direct. I'm not sure if it resonates with me personally, so maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: It's a common theme but presented in a simple way. Maybe a 5.
3. Good: Effective in conveying a benefit, perhaps a 6.
4. Attractive: The message is straightforward but lacks creativity. I might give it a 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Not sure if I need this product. It's probably not top of mind for me yet, so maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: If the ad convinces others and I feel pressured by social norms, maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: It's something I might think about if I start feeling tired, so perhaps a 5.

I need to make sure these scores reflect my personality traits. Since I'm thorough (strongly agree), I would consider the product but not rush into buying it. Worrying a lot makes me cautious, so maybe the purchase intentions are lower than average.
