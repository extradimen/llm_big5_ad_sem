Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down their background and personality first.

The person is a female from China, under 20, in high school, works as a civil servant, is divorced, and earns more than 46 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income for Vietnam, especially considering her age and occupation. Now, looking at her personality traits:

She's talkative and outgoing, which means she probably enjoys social interactions and might be influenced by ads that emphasize social aspects. She agrees with being trusting but sometimes rude, so maybe she values honesty in ads but could be turned off if the ad feels manipulative. She does a thorough job and is good at following through, indicating she's detail-oriented and reliable, which might make her appreciate clear and convincing messaging.

However, she tends to be careless and gets nervous easily. This could mean she might not pay too much attention to ads unless they're particularly engaging or relevant. She worries a lot, so perhaps ads that address her concerns about tiredness and looking dull could resonate with her. She's emotionally unstable but has an active imagination and is original, which might make her appreciate creative ad content.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me analyze how each part of her personality affects her response.

1. **Emphasis on social image**: Since she values being outgoing and helpful, the ad's focus on looking dull could hit a nerve. She might want to maintain a good appearance in social settings, so this aspect is relevant.
2. **Trust and Honesty**: The ad is straightforward but makes a strong claim about the consequences of not using the product. If she's trusting, she might believe it, but if she's sometimes rude or gets nervous, she might question the ad's sincerity.
3. **Creativity and Originality**: The phrasing is simple but effective. She values original ideas, so maybe this ad isn't too creative for her, which could affect her interest.
4. **Concerns about tiredness**: Given that she's a high school student with a demanding job as a civil servant (even though she's under 20), the idea of feeling tired is relatable. This could make the ad more persuasive.

For purchase intention: She has a high income, but her tendency to be careless might mean she doesn't follow through on purchases easily. However, if the ad effectively addresses her social concerns and energy needs, she might consider it.

I think the ad's message is clear and targets her desire to look good and feel energetic in social situations. But because of her personality traits like being sometimes rude (maybe she doesn't trust the ad completely) and her tendency to be careless, she might not fully commit to buying the product. However, the message is direct enough that she could still find it believable.

So for attitude towards the ad: She might like it if it resonates with her social needs but might feel it's a bit too pushy because of her distrustful side. For purchase intention: She might consider trying it but isn't fully convinced yet.

I'll give scores based on these thoughts, keeping in mind her personality and how each trait could influence her perception.
