Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: She's a Chinese woman in her late 50s, living with her parents. She has a bachelor's degree and works as an office worker earning between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are reserved, she doesn't find herself helpful or unselfish, but she generally trusts people. However, she tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, isn’t emotionally stable, and while she's original with ideas, she has few artistic interests.

Now, the advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Let me consider each aspect:

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**:
   - **I like the ad**: Given her reserved nature and tendency to be careless, maybe she wouldn't connect much with the ad. She might not find it particularly likable.
   - **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but may not resonate deeply with her if she's not focused on energy drinks or personal grooming. Maybe neutral.
   - **I believe the ad is good**: She generally trusts people, so she might give it a middle score. It's positive, but maybe not compelling.
   - **I find the ad attractive**: The wording is catchy, but given her personality traits, she might not find it very attractive.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - **I intend to purchase this product**: She’s an office worker; perhaps she values staying energized, but considering her age and reserved nature, maybe not a strong intention.
   - **I will try to buy this product**: Without strong motivation, she might not feel the need to try it.
   - **I will consider buying this product**: She might think about it if others recommend, but on her own, perhaps not.

So scoring:

- Ad attitude scores: 3, 4, 5, 3
- Purchase intention: 3, 3, 4

This reflects a neutral to slightly positive response, with consideration but no strong intent.
