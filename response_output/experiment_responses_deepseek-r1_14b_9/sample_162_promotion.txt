Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese male in my late twenties who's a blue-collar worker with a high income. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me think about my background. I'm a blue-collar worker, probably working long hours, maybe physically demanding. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is quite high for a blue-collar worker in China. That might mean that I have the means to afford such products, but perhaps I'm more price-sensitive since it's not common.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree. So maybe I don't engage much socially.
- Outgoing and Sociable: Neutral. Not very into social activities.
- Reserved: Disagree. Maybe a bit more open than reserved.
- Helpful and Unselfish: Disagree. Probably not the most community-oriented.
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree. Cautious about offers, maybe skeptical.
- Sometimes Rude: Agree. So perhaps I'm not the most polite person.
- Thorough Job: Strongly Disagree. Not very detail-oriented.
- Make Plans and Follow Through: Disagree. Maybe not too organized.
- Careless: Disagree. Probably responsible in my work.
- Nervous Easily: Neutral. Average level of anxiety.
- Worry a lot: Agree. Tend to stress about things.
- Emotionally Stable: Disagree. Might be moody or stressed.
- Active Imagination: Strongly Disagree. Not creative.
- Original and New Ideas: Neutral. Maybe average in innovation.
- Artistic Interests: Neutral. Probably not very into arts.

So, considering all that, the ad is about staying energized and looking good. Since I'm a blue-collar worker with long hours, being energized might be appealing. But given my skeptical nature (strongly disagree on trusting), I might question if this drink really works. Also, I worry a lot, so maybe health benefits are a draw, but I'm not sure about the claims.

The ad's message is positive and aimed at daily improvement. However, with my tendency to be skeptical, I might not fully trust the product without evidence. My income is high, so price might not be a huge barrier, but if I don't see value, I won't buy it.

Purchase intention: Maybe on the lower side because of skepticism. But since it's something that could help with energy, maybe I'll consider it if others recommend or there are reviews. 

So for ad attitude scores:

1. Like the ad - probably neutral or low because I'm not very moved by such ads.
2. Interesting - might be somewhat interesting but not compelling.
3. Good - not sure; skeptical so maybe disagree.
4. Attractive - not particularly attractive.

Purchase intention:

- Intend to purchase: Low, as skepticism is high.
- Try to buy: Maybe neutral or low.
- Consider buying: Might consider if convinced by other factors.

So scores might be low for the ad's attractiveness and good, but maybe neutral for interesting, considering it's a real issue. Purchase intent might be 1-3 on each scale.
