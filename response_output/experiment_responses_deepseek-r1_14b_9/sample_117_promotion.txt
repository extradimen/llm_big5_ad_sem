Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Let me start by understanding my own profile. I'm from China, male, under 20, a postgraduate student, living with parents, and have a monthly income less than 15 million VND. My personality traits show that I'm reserved (Agree), not very helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), generally trusting (Strongly Agree), sometimes rude (Agree), don't do thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree), make plans and follow through (Strongly Agree), tend to be careless (Agree), get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), worry a lot (Neutral), emotionally stable (Agree), have an active imagination (Agree), original with new ideas (Neutral), and have few artistic interests (Agree).

Now, looking at the ad. It's promoting a drink that helps stay energized and look good daily. The key benefits are energy and appearance.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad: Since I'm reserved and sometimes rude, maybe the ad is too generic or doesn't target me specifically. Not sure if it resonates.
2. Interesting: The idea of looking good and staying energized is appealing, but since I don't care much about appearance, maybe not very interesting to me.
3. Good: As someone trusting (Strongly Agree), but the ad might be seen as manipulative or making exaggerated claims, so my trust could affect this score.
4. Attractive: The message is positive, but again, if it's too focused on looking good, which I don't prioritize, maybe not very attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Since I'm careless (Agree) and tend to be rude, maybe the ad doesn't make me feel the need to buy. Plus, being a student with limited income might affect this.
2. Try to buy: If it's affordable and seems effective, but I don't think the ad targets me well enough, so probably not.
3. Consider buying: Maybe if others recommend it or there are promotions, but I'm more into practical things.

I think my scores would be low because the ad doesn't align with my personality traits much, especially since I'm reserved and don't prioritize looking good as much.
