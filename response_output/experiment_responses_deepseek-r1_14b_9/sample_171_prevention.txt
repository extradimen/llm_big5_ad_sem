Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese civil servant would react to the ad about a drink. Let me break it down step by step.

First, his background: he's over 60, living with parents, makes around 36-45 million VND a month. That's a decent income in Vietnam. He has a bachelor's degree and works as a civil servant, which might mean he values respect and maybe tradition.

His personality traits are interesting. He tends to agree that he does thorough jobs and makes plans, but also agrees that he can be careless. Wait, that's contradictory? Or perhaps he's detail-oriented in some areas but not others. He strongly agrees he sometimes is rude, which might make him come off as brusque but also possibly confident.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention message, targeting the negative consequences of not using the product. It suggests that without the drink, one would feel fatigued and appear unimpressive.

Now, evaluating his attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad. - How would he feel? The ad is straightforward, maybe a bit direct. His personality traits include being helpful (neutral) but also sometimes rude (strongly agrees). Since he's reserved (disagrees), maybe he doesn't find ads too engaging if they're too pushy. But prevention messages can appeal to his thoroughness—maybe he likes that it addresses potential problems.

2. I think the ad is interesting. - Interesting? The message is clear but not particularly creative or engaging. He might not see much innovation here, given he disagrees with having an active imagination and originality. So perhaps neutral on interest.

3. I believe the ad is good. - Goodness could be about effectiveness. The ad uses a fear appeal to make people avoid looking tired or dull. Given his high income and professional background, maybe he values effectiveness in products, so he might agree that it's a good message.

4. I find the ad attractive. - Attractiveness depends on how compelling the message is. A prevention message might not be as attractive as a more aspirational one. Since he tends to get nervous easily (strongly disagrees), maybe this ad doesn't stress him, but does it attract him? Maybe neutral again.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - Intention depends on need and belief in the product's effectiveness. He might feel that using such a drink could help maintain his image at work or social events, which is important for someone in his position. So maybe agree—score 4.

2. I will try to buy this product. - Trying it requires some effort. Since he tends to be thorough but also sometimes careless, maybe he's not too eager to try new things unless convinced. Neutral? Or perhaps 3 because there's a consideration.

3. I will consider buying this product. - Considering is a middle ground. He might think about it as a possible solution to staying alert and looking good, so agree—score 4.

Wait, but he sometimes worries a lot (neutral) and is emotionally stable (disagree). Maybe the ad's message could make him feel that he needs to avoid appearing dull, which is important for someone in his role. So perhaps higher scores on purchase intention.

Alternatively, maybe the ad is too direct or pushes too hard on negatives, making him not want to engage. But given his traits, I think he might find it somewhat persuasive.
