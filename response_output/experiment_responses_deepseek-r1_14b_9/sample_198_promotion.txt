Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an ad for a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at their background: they're from China, female, under 20, high school student, divorced, and has a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND. That's about $1,700 to $2,100 USD. So she's probably looking for affordable but effective products.

Personality-wise, she's talkative (strongly agrees), outgoing (agrees), and neutral on being reserved. She’s helpful and unselfish but neutral there too. Trusting? Strongly disagrees, so she might be skeptical of ads. Sometimes rude? Also strongly disagrees, which is interesting—maybe she's polite. Thorough job? Agrees, plans and follows through? Strongly agrees. So she's organized and careful.

She tends to be careless? Disagrees, so she's careful. Gets nervous easily? No. Worry a lot? Yes, strongly agrees. Emotionally stable? No. So she might have some anxiety or stress. Active imagination? Strongly disagrees, original ideas? Also strongly disagrees. Few artistic interests? Strongly agrees.

So her personality is talkative and outgoing but not reserved. She's helpful but not necessarily in a big way. She's distrustful of others and ads, which could make the ad less persuasive. She's careful, organized, but worries a lot—maybe she’s stressed about school or life as a student.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. So it's targeting energy and appearance.

From her traits, being talkative and outgoing might mean she likes social interactions, so looking good could be important to her for socializing. However, she’s skeptical of ads, which could make her question the product's claims.

She’s careful and organized, so maybe she would check reviews or think about whether it's worth buying. She worries a lot, so maybe the idea of something that can help with energy and appearance is appealing, but her skepticism might hold her back.

Looking at the questions:

Ad attitude:
1. Like the ad: Since she’s skeptical, maybe not. But if the ad is engaging, she might like it a bit. Not strongly.
2. Interesting: If it's presented in an exciting way, maybe interesting, but again, her skepticism could temper that.
3. Good: She might think it's okay, but not great because of distrust.
4. Attractive: Visual appeal might attract her, but the message's credibility is key.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Probably low because she’s skeptical and maybe doesn’t see a strong need if alternatives are available.
2. Try to buy: Maybe neutral—willingness to try isn't high due to trust issues.
3. Consider buying: She might consider, especially if the price is right and it's marketed well, but her careful nature would make her think twice.

So scoring each on a 1-7 scale:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: Maybe around 3—neutral leaning towards slightly positive but not strong.
2. Interesting: Also 3.
3. Good: Maybe 4—meh, okay but not great.
4. Attractive: 5 if the visuals are good, else lower.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 3—maybe somewhat interested.
2. Try: 3—not very likely to try without more info.
3. Consider: 4—on the fence.

But I think she's more critical, so maybe lower scores across the board because of distrust and being analytical.
