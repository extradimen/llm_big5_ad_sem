Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let me break down their background and personality first.

They're from China, male, under 20 with a postgraduate degree. That's interesting because usually, someone with a higher education might be more discerning about products. But he's a blue-collar worker, which could mean his income is stable but perhaps not as high as white-collar jobs. His monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which I think is around $1.5k to $2k USD. That's decent, so maybe he has some disposable income.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree – So he likes to socialize and communicate.
- Outgoing: Neutral – Not too much or too little.
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree – He’s definitely not reserved; he’s outgoing in a way since he's talkative.
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree – Caring towards others, maybe values community or teamwork.
- Trusting: Strongly Agree – Trusts people and brands easily?
- Sometimes rude: Disagree – Doesn't think of himself as rude. Maybe polite.
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree – Doesn’t like to do things thoroughly; perhaps he's a bit careless.
- Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree – Not good at planning or sticking to plans.
- Careless: Strongly Disagree – So, not really. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous point.
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Agree – High anxiety levels.
- Worries a lot: Disagree – Doesn't often worry excessively.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral – Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree – Lacks creativity or imagination.
- Original and comes up with ideas: Agree – Maybe average in this area.
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree – Enjoys arts.

So putting it all together, he's a social person who values helping others but isn't very thorough. He tends to get nervous easily but isn't too worried. His income is decent, and he might be looking for something that can help him stay energized, especially given his active social life.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

He's talkative and outgoing, so the part about staying energized would appeal to him because it supports his social lifestyle. He values looking good, which might be important for someone who is out and about a lot. His income level suggests he can afford such products, but he's not very thorough in his approach, so maybe he isn't convinced by the ad alone. However, since he gets nervous easily, perhaps he's more open to something that provides immediate benefits like energy.

His trust levels are high, so if the brand is trustworthy, he might be more inclined. But he doesn't make plans well, so maybe he's not someone who would plan purchases but rather act on impulse.

So for the ad attitude: He probably likes it because it speaks to his need for energy and looking good. It's interesting as it targets both physical appearance and energy, which are relevant to a social person. He might think it's good because it addresses his lifestyle needs. But he might not find it extremely attractive unless the visuals or message are compelling.

For purchase intention: He may intend to buy if he feels the product meets his needs, but since he tends to be careless and not thorough, maybe his intent isn't very high. Trying it once is possible because of the ad's appeal, but considering buying regularly might depend on how much he trusts the brand or sees others using it.

I need to assign scores from 1-7 for each category. Let me think about each:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like: He probably likes it, so maybe a 5.
2. Interesting: Given his social nature, it's relevant, so 6.
3. Good: It seems positive but may not be outstanding, so 5.
4. Attractive: Maybe not extremely, so 4.

Purchase Intention:
1. Intent: Not very high due to carelessness and lack of thoroughness, maybe 3.
2. Try: Might be interested enough to try once, so 5.
3. Consider: If it's something he can see others using or if the ad is strong, maybe he'll consider, so 4.

But wait, I might have overestimated 'interesting' as 6. Maybe 5? Because while it's relevant, maybe not super interesting unless the execution is great.

Alternatively:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like: 5
2. Interesting: 5
3. Good: 5
4. Attractive: 4

Purchase Intention:
1. Intent: 4
2. Try: 5
3. Consider: 6? Because if he tries it, maybe he'll consider buying again.

Wait, but considering he's easily nervous and not very trusting, the ad needs to be really good for him to have high intent. Maybe lower scores on purchase intention.

Alternatively:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like: 4
2. Interesting: 5
3. Good: 5
4. Attractive: 5

Purchase Intention:
1. Intent: 3
2. Try: 4
3. Consider: 5

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should average out based on his traits.

He's talkative and outgoing, so the ad is probably more interesting to him (maybe higher). But he doesn't like ads that are overly pushy or manipulative. Since he's critical, maybe not too high on 'good' but okay.

In purchase intention, since he tends to be careless and not plan things, maybe lower intent, but the ad's message is appealing enough for him to consider trying it.

So finalizing:

Ad Attitude Scores: 4,5,5,5

Purchase Intention Scores:3,4,5
