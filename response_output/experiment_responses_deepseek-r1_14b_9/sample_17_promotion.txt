Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman in my late 30s with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, living with my parents and earning less than 15 million VND per month. My personality traits are reserved, helpful, unselfish, thorough, but sometimes rude. I don't make plans consistently, am not careless or easily nervous, emotionally stable, but lack an active imagination and originality, and have few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like it? The ad is simple and straightforward, which I appreciate for clarity, but maybe a bit too generic. Not sure if it resonates with me personally since it doesn't specify how or why the drink works. It might not stand out enough to make me like it. Maybe around 3.

2. Is it interesting? Given my reserved nature, perhaps not very interested. The message is clear but lacks depth or creativity. So maybe a 4.

3. Do I think it's good? It conveys its message effectively, which is positive, but again, it's quite basic and doesn't connect with me on a personal level. Maybe a 4.

4. Is it attractive? The phrasing is nice, but without visuals or more compelling details, it might not be particularly attractive to someone like me who isn't easily swayed by such ads. Perhaps a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy it? My monthly income is low, so price matters. Plus, I'm thorough and don't rush into purchases without considering alternatives. The ad doesn't provide enough info about benefits or ingredients, so maybe a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? Since the drink claims energy and appearance benefits, which are appealing, but I need more information before making a decision. Maybe around a 5, as I'm somewhat interested but cautious.

3. Would I consider buying it? It's something I might think about if I saw more about the product elsewhere, like reviews or detailed info in stores. So maybe a 4.
