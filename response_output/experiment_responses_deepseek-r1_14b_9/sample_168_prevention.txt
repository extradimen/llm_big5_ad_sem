Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let's break down the components. The target audience seems to be someone looking for energy or wanting to maintain a good appearance. Given that I'm an office worker living with parents in China, maybe it's targeting people like me who might need a quick energy boost without feeling too tired.

Looking at my personality traits: I agree being talkative and original but strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, trusting, thorough, or following through plans. I tend to be careless sometimes, get nervous easily, worry a bit, have an active imagination, and don't have strong artistic interests.

The ad's message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull. Since I agree with feeling talkative but neutral on being outgoing, maybe the ad doesn't emphasize social interactions enough. The part about looking dull might resonate if I care about my appearance, which I'm not sure about since I didn't express strong feelings there.

I get nervous easily (Agree), so maybe this drink could help me stay calm or energetic when needed. However, being careless and sometimes rude might make the ad's benefits less important to me because I don't prioritize these aspects highly.

The purchase intentions: Do I intend to buy? Well, if the ad makes me think about needing energy, but considering my personality, I'm not very thorough or planful, so maybe I wouldn't follow through. Trying it might be possible, but considering buying sounds less likely unless I feel a strong need.

I should rate each attitude and intention based on how much they align with the ad's message and my traits.
