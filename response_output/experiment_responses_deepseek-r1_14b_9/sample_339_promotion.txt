Alright, I'm a female student from China, under 20, living with my parents and earning between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND monthly. I have a postgraduate degree, which is a bit unusual for someone my age, but it's possible in certain fields or through specific programs. My personality traits include being helpful and unselfish, thorough in my work, planning ahead, and having an active imagination. However, I'm not outgoing, sometimes reserved, not very original with ideas, and have few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, evaluating my attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? The ad's message is about energy and appearance. Since I'm a student, staying energized could be relevant, especially with academic pressures. However, the aspect of looking good might not resonate as much since I don't have strong artistic interests or focus on appearances. So, maybe 3/7.

2. Is it interesting? The idea of a drink that combines energy and appearance is catchy but may feel too broad. It's an interesting concept, but without specific details, it might not hold my attention long. Maybe around 4/7.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is positive and appealing for someone busy, like a student. However, it lacks depth or unique selling points. So, perhaps a middle score like 5/7.

4. Is the ad attractive? Visual appeal matters, but if the visuals are generic, it might not be very attractive to me. Maybe 3/7.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The product seems useful, but I'm cautious about health products without proven benefits. My thorough nature makes me question effectiveness, so maybe a low score like 2/7.

2. Will try to buy: Even if interested, without strong motivation or evidence, trying it might not be the first choice. Maybe 3/7.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, but I'm more likely to wait for reviews or see if others recommend it. So, perhaps 4/7.
