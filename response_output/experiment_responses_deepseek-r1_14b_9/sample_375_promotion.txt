Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. The target demographic is a 30-39-year-old Chinese woman who is a divorced civil servant with a high income. Her personality traits are talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), not reserved (disagree), neutral on being helpful, not trusting (disagree), not rude (disagree), thorough (strongly agree), not good at following through (disagree), not careless (disagree), gets nervous easily (strongly agree), doesn't worry a lot (strongly disagree), emotionally stable (agree), has an active imagination (strongly disagree), original and comes up with ideas (agree), and has strong artistic interests (strongly disagree).

So, the person is talkative, outgoing, not reserved, somewhat helpful, but not very trusting. She's thorough in her work, but doesn't always follow through on plans. She gets nervous easily, which might make her more cautious or anxious about new products. She isn't worried much, which could mean she's less stressed about daily pressures. Emotionally stable and original, so she values unique ideas but isn't very imaginative.

Now, evaluating the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance. Since she's a civil servant, maybe she has a busy job that requires staying alert. Looking good is also important for maintaining professional image or personal confidence.

Given her personality, she values being talkative and outgoing, so something that helps her maintain energy might align with her social life. She's not very trusting of others, which could make her skeptical of such ads unless the product has credibility. Her thoroughness suggests she would want a reliable product, but she doesn't always follow through on things, so maybe she's more cautious about trying new products.

She gets nervous easily, which might make her hesitant to try something that claims too much without evidence. However, the ad is positive and focuses on daily benefits—looking good every day could appeal to someone who values consistency and routine.

Her artistic interests are low, but being original herself, she might appreciate a product that stands out or offers unique benefits beyond just energy.

Putting this together:

1. I like the ad: The ad's message is positive, focusing on energy and appearance. Since she's talkative and outgoing, staying energized could help her social life. But she's not very trusting, so she might not fully like it unless she trusts the product. Maybe a 4.

2. Interesting: The idea of a drink that does two things—energizing and improving appearance—is interesting. She might find it intriguing but not necessarily compelling. A 5?

3. Good: To assess if the ad is good, we look at clarity and appeal. It's clear and positive, but she's skeptical. Maybe a 4.

4. Attractive: The message is attractive because it touches on personal goals like looking good and staying energized. So maybe a higher score here, around 5 or 6. Let's say 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She might not be immediately convinced; she needs more information or trust. So maybe low, like 3.

2. Will try to buy: If the ad convinces her enough and she trusts it, she might consider trying it. Maybe a 4.

3. Consider buying: Given her cautious nature but also desire for energy, she could be on the fence. Perhaps a 5 or so.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-evaluate. If she's talkative and outgoing, she values being energetic, which aligns with the ad's message. Her thoroughness suggests she might do her research before buying, but her tendency to get nervous could make her hesitant. The ad doesn't provide evidence or details, so maybe that affects her attitude.

So for ad态度 scores: Like (4), Interesting (5), Good (4), Attractive (5).

Purchase intention: Intend (3), Try (4), Consider (5).
