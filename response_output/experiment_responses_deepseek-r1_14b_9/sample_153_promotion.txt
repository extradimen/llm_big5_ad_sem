Alright, let me walk through how I came up with my responses for the ad evaluation. 

Starting with the **attitude toward the advertisement**:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look good. Being a blue-collar worker, staying energetic is important for work. But looking good isn't a top priority for me, so I'm not sure if this appeals much. Maybe 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The benefits seem relevant, but the wording feels a bit generic. Not super engaging. Perhaps a 4?

3. **I believe the ad is good**: It makes some valid points about energy and appearance, but it's too vague. I don't feel convinced it's effective. Maybe a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The message isn't tailored to me much, so not very attractive. A 2 seems right.

Moving on to **purchase intention**:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: I'm more into practical needs than looking good. Unless there's proof it works, I don't feel compelled. So a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Maybe if others recommend it or if I see it in stores, but not because of the ad alone. A 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's on my radar, but other factors like price and availability matter more. So a 4.
