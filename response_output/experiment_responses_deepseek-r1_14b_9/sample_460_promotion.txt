Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** – The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given that I have a high income and live with parents in China, maybe the drink is targeting professionals who need energy. However, the description feels a bit generic without specific benefits. So, I'm Neutral here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – The message is clear but lacks unique selling points. Without specifics on how it helps, like health ingredients or long-term benefits, it's not very engaging for me. Hence, Neutral again.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** – It makes some claims about energy and appearance, which are positive. But without evidence or specific details, I'm skeptical. So, a 5 on belief.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** – The visual aspects might be appealing, but the copy lacks depth. Since I focus on practicality and thoroughness, the ad isn't very compelling to me, so Neutral.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – Without specific benefits or proof of effectiveness, there's no strong reason for me to buy it. Strongly Disagree here, a 1.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** – The ad doesn't offer enough incentive or evidence to convince me to even consider trying it. So, Neutral again.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** – Since the ad lacks compelling reasons and details, I don't see a reason to think about purchasing it. Hence, another 1.

Overall, while the ad has positive messages, the lack of specific details and evidence makes it less impactful for me, leading to low scores on both attitude and purchase intention.
