Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: she's from China, over 60, married, with a postgraduate degree but is currently a student. Her monthly income is quite high, around 36 to 45 million VND. Personality-wise, she strongly agrees being outgoing and helpful, which might make her more responsive to social messages in ads. However, she sometimes feels rude, which could mean she doesn't like overly pushy ads. She's neutral on talkativeness but tends to agree with reservedness, so maybe she prefers ads that aren't too overbearing.

Looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The ad is targeting fatigue and appearances, which are common concerns, especially for someone in her age group. However, considering her income level, she might be more interested in premium products rather than basic ones.

Her personality traits include being helpful, trusting, and original, but also sometimes rude and agrees with worrying a lot. She's neutral on making thorough efforts, planning, and emotional stability. Her imagination is low, but she's original.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude: She might not strongly like it because while it addresses tiredness and looking good, which are important, the phrasing is direct. Since she sometimes feels rude, a more subtle approach might be better. The ad isn't particularly interesting to her; she finds it neutral. She believes the ad is okay but not great, so a 3 on that. Attractiveness-wise, it's just average for her.

Purchase intentions: Does she intend to buy? Maybe not strongly, since she's more critical of ads. But considering her income and the importance of looking good, she might consider trying it once. However, without strong belief in the product beyond the ad, her consideration is there but not high.

So scoring: Ad attitude would be 3 for like, interesting as 2, good at 3, attractive at 4. Purchase intention scores are intend=4, try=5, consider=6.
