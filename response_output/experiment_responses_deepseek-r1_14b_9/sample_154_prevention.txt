Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40â€“49-year-old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, currently a student living with her parents, and earning between 26,000,000 to 35,000,000 VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Agree), trusting (Neutral), sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), not thorough (Strongly Disagree), not good at planning (Strongly Disagree), careless (Disagree), emotionally stable (Disagree), imaginative (Agree), original with ideas (Strongly Agree), and artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, I'll analyze my attitude toward the ad. Since I'm outgoing and helpful, maybe the ad's message about not feeling tired resonates because being sociable requires energy. The claim that without the drink, one might look dull could appeal to someone who values their appearance in social settings.

For purchase intention, considering I have a high income, maybe I can afford it. However, since I'm not thorough and don't plan well, I might not be convinced by just this ad alone. Plus, being original but not particularly into artistic things might mean I'm more focused on practical benefits than the product's image.

So, for attitude scores: 5,6,5,6. For purchase intentions: 4,3,4.
