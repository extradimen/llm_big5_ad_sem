Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and provide scores based on my hypothetical demographic profile and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down how I would approach this.

First, understanding the ad: It's targeting people who are looking to stay energetic and appear vibrant. Given that I'm a 20-29 year old postgraduate student from China with a monthly income of around 36 million VND, I might be someone who values staying alert, especially since studying can be tiring.

Looking at my personality traits: I disagree that I'm talkative but agree I'm outgoing. So maybe the ad's message about looking dull resonates because I care about how others perceive me socially. However, I strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might make me less inclined to relate to ads that emphasize community or sharing.

I generally trust people (Agree) so the ad might build some credibility there, but I'm also someone who does a thorough job (Strongly Agree), meaning I might be critical of the product's actual benefits. The ad seems to focus on feelings rather than concrete benefits, which could make me question its effectiveness.

I tend to be careless (Agree) and sometimes get nervous easily (Neutral). Maybe the ad plays into those traits by suggesting that without it, negative feelings would occur, thus encouraging me to prevent that. But since I'm not very trusting of my own emotions in making decisions, I might need more concrete information.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude scores:

1. Like: The message is clear and relatable for someone looking to stay energized, but the emotional appeal might feel a bit manipulative, so maybe around 5.
2. Interesting: The concept is straightforward but not particularly novel. Maybe a 4.
3. Good: It effectively conveys the product's benefit, so perhaps a 5.
4. Attractive: Visuals and messaging are important; without seeing it, I'll assume moderate appeal, so maybe a 6.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The ad doesn't provide enough evidence of effectiveness, so probably a low score like 3.
2. Try to buy: If the ad creates curiosity, I might consider trying it once, so maybe 4.
3. Consider buying: It's on my radar now, so perhaps a higher score, maybe 5.

Overall, I'm not fully convinced by just the ad's message but might be swayed if more information is provided elsewhere.
