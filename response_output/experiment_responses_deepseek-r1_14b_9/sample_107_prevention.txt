Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're a Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree and works as a civil servant. She's married and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's talkative but neutral on being outgoing, strongly disagrees with being reserved. She's helpful but leans towards disagree, which might mean she doesn't see herself as very unselfish. Trusting, not rude, thorough in her work, neutral about making plans and being careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot but is emotionally stable, has an active imagination, original, and strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

So, for the ad's attitude:

1. Like the ad: The message seems to focus on preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since she's over 60, maybe she's concerned about energy and appearance. She values being thorough and getting nervous easily might make her relate to feeling tired. However, she worries a lot but is emotionally stable. I'm not sure if she would find it likable. Maybe neutral.

2. Interesting: The ad's message is straightforward. It might be seen as common or not very creative. She has an active imagination and is original, so maybe the ad isn't interesting enough for her. So perhaps a 3.

3. Good: For being good, she might think about whether it's truthful. If she trusts (which she does), but the claim seems a bit generic. Maybe neutral again.

4. Attractive: The visual aspects aren't described, so I'll assume it's not particularly attractive to her if there are no details. So maybe 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: She might be cautious about trying new products, especially given her monthly income is less than 15 million VND. Maybe a 4 on the lower side.

2. Try to buy: Since she's thorough and gets nervous easily, perhaps she would try it but not immediately. So maybe around 3.

3. Consider buying: She might think about it but isn't sure yet. Maybe a 4.

So putting it all together, I'm thinking the scores for ad attitude would be [4, 3, 4, 3], and purchase intentions as [4, 3, 4]. But wait, maybe she's more concerned about health, so the ad could resonate more. So perhaps bump up some scores.
