Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad targets energy and looking good, which are relatable but not particularly appealing given my reserved nature. Since I don't find it exciting or relevant to my lifestyle, I scored a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but lacks depth or uniqueness. It doesn't capture my imagination, so another 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the claims are positive, there's no evidence provided to back them up. My skepticism leads me to a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals might be appealing, but the content doesn't resonate with me personally, so I gave it a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My reserved and practical nature makes me hesitant without more information, scoring a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong motivation or evidence, the desire to try is low, so another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's in my consideration set but not prioritized, hence a 3.
