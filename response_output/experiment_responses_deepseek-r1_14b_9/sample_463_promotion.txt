Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Since I'm reserved and helpful, I don't find ads overly exciting unless they align with my values. The ad doesn't speak to me directly, so a 3 makes sense.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message about energy and looking good is clear but not engaging enough for someone with an active imagination who isn't into new ideas. So, a 4.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - It's functional but lacks emotional depth or unique appeal. A neutral 4 feels right here.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Not particularly appealing to my personality traits, so another 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My high planning and thoroughness make me skeptical of such claims without proof. I'm more cautious, so a 3.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Given my tendency to be careful, I might not rush to try it unless convinced by other factors. A 4 seems fair.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on the radar but not a priority. A middle score of 5 captures that consideration without strong commitment.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate deeply with my personality and background, leading to moderate scores in both attitude and purchase intention.
