Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this ad. 

Starting with my attitude toward the advertisement: 
1. **I like the ad.** Given that I'm reserved and not very talkative, energetic ads might not resonate as much. Plus, the promise of looking my best doesn't particularly appeal to me since I don't prioritize looking a certain way.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** While I have an active imagination, this ad's message seems generic and not very compelling, so I'm only giving it a 3.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** The claims are vague and lack specific benefits, which makes me skeptical. Not enough evidence here to trust it.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visual and emotional appeal might be there for others, but not for me given my personality traits.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm not convinced by the claims, so no intention here.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without belief in the product's benefits, trying it isn't something I'd consider.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** Even though the ad didn't persuade me much, maybe seeing it again or more information could make me think about it, hence a 4.

Overall, while not entirely negative, the ad doesn't align well with my personality and priorities, leading to these scores.
