Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree and currently a student. My monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which is quite comfortable but not extremely high. I'm divorced, so maybe my spending habits are influenced by that.

Looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message seems to target people who want to stay alert and presentable. Since I have a busy schedule as a student, staying awake is important for studying or attending events.

The ad uses fear of looking dull, which could appeal to me if I'm concerned about my appearance. However, the way it's phrased feels a bit negative—emphasizing what happens without the drink might not be very motivating. It doesn't offer positive benefits beyond avoiding tiredness and looking bad.

Considering my personality traits: I sometimes find myself being careless (strongly disagree), which means I'm more methodical. The ad doesn't provide evidence or details about how effective the drink is, so as a careful person, that might make me skeptical.

I worry a lot? Disagree. But I get nervous easily: strongly agree. So maybe the ad's message makes me anxious about feeling tired without it. However, anxiety isn't a positive motivator for purchase decisions. 

My emotional stability: strongly agree. That helps me stay calm despite the ad's possible negative effects.

I'm original and come up with new ideas: agree. But the ad doesn't seem creative or unique to me—it's a common approach in ads to show a problem and suggest their product as the solution. It feels formulaic, so it might not stand out to someone like me who appreciates originality.

Given all this, I'm not particularly drawn to the ad. It doesn't resonate emotionally or intellectually with me because it lacks depth and creativity. Therefore, my attitude toward the ad is neutral to slightly negative across the scores. As for purchase intention, since the ad doesn't convince me of the product's benefits, I don't feel compelled to buy it. However, considering the price point and my income level, maybe I'm more likely to consider trying it once than someone with a lower income.

But wait, my monthly income is quite high, so perhaps I'm more open to purchasing premium products. Yet, without compelling reasons or evidence from the ad, my consideration remains low.
