Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're a Chinese woman in her 30s with a postgraduate degree but not employed full-time, divorced, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's talkative, reserved, helpful, trusting (neutral), sometimes rude (disagree), careless (strongly agree), gets nervous easily (strongly agree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), has an active imagination (disagree), original with new ideas (strongly agree), and has few artistic interests (disagree).

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting the desire to stay energized and presentable.

For the ad attitude scores:
1. I like the ad: The message is about looking good and feeling energetic, which might appeal to someone who cares about their image but she's reserved and talkative. However, she's emotionally stable but gets nervous and worries a lot, so maybe she doesn't need such products? Not sure. Maybe neutral?
2. Interesting: It's a common ad theme, but her agreeable side might find it somewhat interesting. Perhaps around 4.
3. Good: If the message is clear and relatable, she might think it's good, but given she's not high income, maybe lower. Maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: The tagline is catchy, so maybe 6.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: She's careless but also has a high need for originality and ideas. If the product seems useful, maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: Might not be immediate without seeing it, perhaps around 3.
3. Consider buying: It's possible if she feels the product meets her needs, so maybe a 5.

I'm not entirely sure about all these scores, but this is my initial thought process.
