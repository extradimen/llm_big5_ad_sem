Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   The ad targets tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable concerns. However, the phrasing feels a bit strong and negative without offering much positivity or alternative benefits beyond the drink. Given my personality traits, especially being reserved and sometimes disagreeable with ads that push too hard, I'm not particularly drawn to it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   While the message is clear, it's pretty generic. There's no unique angle or creativity here, so it doesn't stand out as interesting to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   The ad does its job of conveying a benefit but lacks depth and emotional appeal. It doesn't resonate strongly with me, hence a neutral score.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Attractiveness depends on style, which this ad doesn't provide details about. Without knowing more about visuals or tone, it's hard to say, so I'm neutral.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   The ad focuses on a negative outcome without highlighting any unique selling points of the drink. It doesn't create a strong enough desire for me to intend buying it.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Since there's no compelling reason or evidence provided, I'm not motivated to seek out or try the product.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   The ad doesn't provide enough information about the product itself, like ingredients or benefits beyond just feeling tired. Without more info, it doesn't prompt me to consider purchasing.
