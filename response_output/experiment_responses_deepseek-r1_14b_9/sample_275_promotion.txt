Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm a 50-59-year-old man from China with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. My monthly income is under 15 million VND, and I'm married. From the personality traits, I'm outgoing but not talkative, helpful, or trusting—it seems like I strongly disagree on those. But I do agree that I make thorough plans, am careless sometimes (though I mostly disagree), get nervous a lot, don't worry much, have an active imagination, and come up with new ideas.

Now, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, the message is about energy and looking good, which sounds appealing for someone needing a boost. But considering my personality—I'm reserved, not helpful or trusting—maybe it doesn't hit home. I'm more on the disagree side but not strongly. Maybe around 3.

2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized and looking good is pretty common in ads, so maybe it's not that interesting. I don't feel strongly either way; perhaps a 4.

3. Good: As an ad, does it make sense? It's straightforward but might lack depth. Maybe a 5 on the scale.

4. Attractive: The visuals and message could be attractive if well-made, so maybe a higher score like 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm practical. If the drink works as advertised, I might consider it, but blue-collar workers might look for value. So maybe a 5.

2. Try to buy: Maybe 4 since there's interest but no immediate need.

3. Consider buying: Possibly higher, like 6, because the idea is tempting despite practical concerns.
