Alright, let me break this down step by step. I'm a 25-year-old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree working as a civil servant and currently divorced, earning about 16-25 million VND a month. My personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, trusting (though I strongly disagree on being trusting), sometimes rude, thorough but careless, not easily nervous, emotionally stable, imaginative, original, and with few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, my attitude toward the advertisement. 

1. I like the ad: The ad seems positive, focusing on energy and appearance. Being helpful and outgoing, I appreciate messages that encourage well-being, but I'm a bit skeptical about how realistic it is. So, maybe a 4.

2. Interesting: The idea of combining energy with looking good is catchy. However, it's quite common in ads, so maybe a 5.

3. Good: It's straightforward and has clear benefits. But since I'm more critical, perhaps a 6 isn't too high.

4. Attractive: The message is appealing, but I might find it a bit overused, so a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: I don't have a strong reason yet; maybe neutral at 4.

2. Try to buy: Maybe if I saw it somewhere, I'd consider trying once, so 5.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, but not a must-have, so 4.
