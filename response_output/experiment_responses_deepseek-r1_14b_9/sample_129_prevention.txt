Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break down their background and personality first.

They're a Chinese male in his 30s, an office worker with a high income. He's divorced, which might mean he values convenience or perhaps has certain stress-relief needs. His education is high school, so he's likely practical without advanced formal training but still capable of handling office work.

Looking at his personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree
- Outgoing/Sociable: Disagree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful/Unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes Rude: Strongly Agree
- Thorough Job: Strongly Agree
- Makes Plans/Follows Through: Disagree
- Careless: Neutral
- Nervous Easily: Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Agree
- Active Imagination: Disagree
- Original/New Ideas: Disagree
- Artistic Interests: Agree

So, he's reserved and not too talkative but can be trusting. He's thorough in his work but doesn't always follow through on plans. He gets nervous easily but is emotionally stable. He has few artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This seems to target energy levels and social appearance, which might appeal to someone looking to maintain their image or stamina.

Considering his personality:

- Since he's reserved, an ad that emphasizes personal effects (like appearing dull) might not strongly resonate. He doesn't place high value on social interactions, so the tiredness aspect could be a point if it affects his work performance.
- His agreeableness in trusting and being thorough suggests he might consider products that promise effectiveness, but his tendency to worry and get nervous might make him cautious about the claims.
- His lack of interest in creativity or originality doesn't align with ads that emphasize innovation, so the message here is more practical.

Evaluating attitude towards the ad:

1. Like: He's not very outgoing, so he might not find the ad particularly likable unless it directly addresses his needs. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull could be somewhat interesting but not compelling enough for him to strongly agree. Perhaps a 4.
3. Good: If the ad is truthful and effective, he might see it as good. Since he's trusting, maybe a 5.
4. Attractive: Ads that are visually appealing or have a strong message can attract him, but the content here is basic. Maybe a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's thorough but not necessarily driven by such ads. Unless convinced of the product's benefits, maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Slightly higher than intent because of the ad's message, maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: Given his cautious nature and practicality, he might consider it, so a 5.

I think these scores make sense considering his reserved nature and focus on practical benefits.
