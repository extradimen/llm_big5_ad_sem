Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for the advertisement and my purchase intentions. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad focuses on preventing tiredness and dull looks, which is a relatable concern. Since I'm talkative and outgoing, looking good and feeling energetic matters to me when socializing. So, I agree it's something positive.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The message targets common daily issues, making it relevant. It's simple and direct, which I find interesting without being too flashy. 

3. **I believe the ad is good.** While the message is clear, I feel it's a bit generic. There's no unique angle or emotional appeal that makes it stand out. So, my belief in its effectiveness is neutral.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The ad lacks creativity and emotional depth, which are important for me to find something truly attractive. It's more of an informative message than an engaging one.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm cautious about such products since there are many on the market. Without specific benefits highlighted, my intent is low.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's no compelling reason for me to choose this drink over others, so trying it isn't a priority.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** The ad makes me think about energy drinks in general, but not specifically this one. It adds to the consideration rather than driving action.
