Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad itself: It's a prevention-oriented advertisement because it's highlighting negative outcomes you might avoid by using their productâ€”feeling tired and looking dull without it.

Looking at my personality traits, I'm talkative but not outgoing or sociable, which means social settings might matter less to me. However, I'm helpful and unselfish, so maybe the ad appeals to my desire to look good in social situations to help others see me as more presentable.

The ad's message is about looking tired and dull without their drink. Since I'm emotionally stable but sometimes agree that I tend to be careless, this could play into my mind if I associate looking tired with being less helpful or attentive. But considering I disagree with being thorough, maybe the ad doesn't strongly resonate because I don't see the need for such products.

Regarding attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: Neutral (4). The message is somewhat relevant but not compelling enough given my personality.
2. Interesting: Slightly agree (5). It's a common theme in ads, so it's somewhat interesting but not unique.
3. Good: Neutral to slightly disagree (4). It's effective for some but doesn't hit home with me personally.
4. Attractive: Disagree (3). The visuals and message are average.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend: Disagree (3). Not convinced by the ad alone.
2. Try: Neutral (4). Maybe if others recommend it, I might consider trying once.
3. Consider: Neutral to agree (5). If there's more positive buzz or evidence, I could think about buying it.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly persuade me due to my personality traits and how I perceive the product's benefits.
