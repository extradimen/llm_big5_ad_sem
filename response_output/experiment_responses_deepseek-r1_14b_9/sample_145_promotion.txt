Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the ad based on their background and personality. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: He's from China, over 60, has a high school education, works in an office, lives with his parents, and earns between 26-35 million VND monthly. That's a pretty comfortable income, so he might be looking for quality products that fit his lifestyle.

Looking at his personality traits:
- Outgoing: Strongly Agree. He probably enjoys social interactions, so ads that highlight social benefits could appeal to him.
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree. His outgoing nature aligns with the ad's message of staying energized and looking good, which are social positives.
- Trusting: Disagree. This might make him more skeptical of the ad's claims, especially if they seem too good to be true.
- Careless: Agree. He might not pay as much attention to detailed ads or complex information, so the message needs to be clear and direct.
- Imaginative and original: Strongly Agree. Ads that are creative and unique could catch his interest.
- Artistic interests: Disagree. So maybe not interested in overly artistic ad content.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For the ad attitude:
1. Like: He's outgoing and enjoys positive messages about energy and appearance, which are social positives. But he's somewhat disagreeable in trusting the ad, so maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The claim is interesting, especially for someone who values looking good and being energized. Maybe a 5.
3. Good: The message seems positive but might be too generic. He's not very trusting, so perhaps a 4.
4. Attractive: The combination of energy and appearance is appealing, so maybe a 6.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend: He's careful but also has an active imagination. The ad might make him consider it, but he's cautious, so a 3.
2. Try: Maybe he'd be willing to try it if recommended, so a 4.
3. Consider: Definitely on his radar, so a 5.

I think these scores balance his outgoing nature with his skepticism and cautiousness about purchases.
