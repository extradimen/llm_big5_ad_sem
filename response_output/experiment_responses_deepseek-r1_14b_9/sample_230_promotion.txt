Alright, let's break this down. I'm evaluating an ad for a drink that claims to help stay energized and look your best every day. My task is to score how I feel about the ad and my intention to buy based on the given personality traits.

Starting with my demographics: I'm over 60, Chinese, single, postgrad education, earn less than 15 million VND a month, and work in 'Other.' My income might make me more price-sensitive. The product is a drink, which could be seen as a daily expense, so cost is a consideration.

Personality-wise, I'm reserved (strongly agree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), not very thorough (strongly disagree), but do make plans and follow through (agree). I get nervous easily (strongly agree) and worry a lot (agree), which might affect how I perceive health products. My imagination is active (strongly agree), but I'm not original with ideas (strongly disagree) and have few artistic interests (agree).

Looking at the ad: It's promoting energy and looking good daily, which are common themes in health and beauty ads. The claims seem general enough to appeal broadly but might not address specific concerns.

For attitude towards the ad:
1. I like the ad. - Neutral? Maybe a 4 because it's okay but doesn't excite me.
2. Interesting - Probably 3 since it's not particularly engaging or unique.
3. Good - 4; it's functional but lacks depth.
4. Attractive - 5 if it has visuals that appeal, but maybe lower based on my reserved nature.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Maybe 3, as I'm cautious and might need more evidence.
2. Try to buy: Perhaps 4, since the claims are somewhat appealing.
3. Consider buying: 5, because it's something that could be useful but not a priority.

I'm torn between practicality and skepticism. The ad doesn't connect on a personal level enough for me to feel strongly about it either way.
