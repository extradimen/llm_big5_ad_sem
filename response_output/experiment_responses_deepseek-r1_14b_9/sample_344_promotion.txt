Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ad itself: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target audience here seems to be people who value energy and appearance. Since I'm a student in China with an income of 16-25 million VND, I might be looking for something that fits my lifestyle.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree. So maybe not someone who's into social interactions a lot.
- Outgoing: Neutral. Not too outgoing but not reserved either.
- Reserved: Agree. So perhaps more introverted.
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree. Values community and others.
- Trusting: Strongly Agree. Trusts brands and people.
- Rude: Strongly Disagree. Polite person.
- Thorough job: Neutral. Doesn't mind doing tasks but not overly detailed.
- Make plans: Strongly Disagree. Not very organized or maybe forgetful.
- Careless: Neutral. Sometimes forgetful, but not a big issue.
- Nervous easily: Disagree. Not too anxious.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree. Doesn't stress much.
- Emotionally stable: Disagree. Maybe has some ups and downs.
- Active imagination: Neutral. Can daydream but not excessively.
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree. Creative thinker.
- Artistic interests: Agree. Enjoys art or creative activities.

So putting this together, I'm a reserved, trusting, helpful person who values creativity but isn't too outgoing. I might be more into personal care products that help me feel good without needing to socialize much.

The ad's message is about energy and looking good daily. Since I value looking my best and being energetic, it could resonate with me. But the way it's presentedâ€”maybe it's aimed at more outgoing people? Hmm. Maybe not directly tailored for someone like me who's reserved but still cares about appearance.

For attitude toward the ad:

1. Like: I'm not sure if I'd like it because it might be targeting a different personality type, but the benefits are appealing. So maybe 4/7.
2. Interesting: The message is clear, so it's interesting in that sense. Maybe 5/7.
3. Good: It's positive and makes me feel like it could help, so perhaps 6/7.
4. Attractive: Visuals matter, but since I'm more reserved, maybe not the most attractive to me. So around 5/7.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad's benefits are good, but I might need more reasons. Maybe 4/7.
2. Try to buy: If it's available and seems effective, I could consider trying it. Maybe 5/7.
3. Consider buying: It's on my radar now, so maybe 6/7.

I think the main factors here are that while the ad offers benefits I care about, the way it's presented might not align perfectly with my personality. However, the core message is still appealing enough for me to consider the product.
