Alright, let me break down how I arrived at each score. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad**: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which sounds appealing. However, I'm reserved and sometimes get nervous easily, so maybe it's a bit too much for me. I'd give it a 4.
2. **Interesting**: The claims are clear but not unique. I don't find it extremely interesting because the benefits are common in such ads. A 3 seems fair.
3. **Good**: While the message is positive, it feels a bit generic and lacks specific details about how it actually helps. So, a 4 here.
4. **Attractive**: The idea of looking good and having energy is attractive, but without seeing the ad or knowing more about the product, I'm not fully drawn to it. A 5.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy**: As a student with high income, maybe I can afford it, but I don't feel strongly convinced yet. A 3.
2. **Try to buy**: If I see more evidence or offers, I might consider trying it once. So, a 4.
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar, but I'm not sure enough to commit without more info. A 5.

Overall, the ad doesn't hit me as strongly because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry about products' effectiveness.
