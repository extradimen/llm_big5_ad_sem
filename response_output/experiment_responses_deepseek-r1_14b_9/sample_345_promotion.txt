Alright, let's break this down. I'm a Chinese female under 20 with a bachelor’s degree and other occupation, currently divorced, earning between 26–35 million VND monthly. My personality traits are reserved, helpful, trusting, thorough but not much of a planner, sometimes careless, not easily nervous but worry a lot, emotionally stable, not imaginative or original, and have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I'm reserved and agree to being helpful and unselfish. The ad's message is positive, promoting energy and looking good, which are appealing. But since I'm not very outgoing or talkative, maybe it doesn't hit me as strongly.

I worry a lot but am emotionally stable. The idea of something that can help with daily energy might appeal to someone needing stamina, but my thoroughness makes me question if this drink is effective without more evidence.

The ad's attractiveness: It sounds good, but without seeing visuals or knowing the brand, it's hard to be convinced. I'm not someone who gets easily influenced by ads since I'm reserved and trustful but cautious.

Purchase intention: Maybe a 4 out of 7 for considering buying because it seems useful, but without more info, I'm hesitant.
