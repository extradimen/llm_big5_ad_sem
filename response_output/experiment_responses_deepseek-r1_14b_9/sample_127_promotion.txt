Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My background is as a Chinese male over 60 with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, living with parents, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. I'm outgoing but tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily. I also have few artistic interests but am helpful, original, and sometimes careless.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is about energy and looking good, which seems positive. However, as someone over 60, maybe it's more targeted towards younger people. Also, being a civil servant might make me cautious about health products. So, maybe a 3 on liking it.

2. Is the ad interesting? It's straightforward but doesn't seem to capture my interest much. I don't see anything exciting or innovative here. Maybe a 3 for interesting.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear, but without any emotional appeal or specific benefits, it feels generic. I'm not sure if it's effective. A 4 might be fair.

4. Is the ad attractive? The visuals and messaging are simple, but nothing stands out to make it visually appealing. Perhaps a 3 for attractiveness.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy? My cautious nature makes me question the product's effectiveness without more evidence. Plus, my income is limited, so I might not prioritize this. A 2 here.

2. Will I try to buy? Even if I'm interested, trying it would require some effort and cost. Maybe a 3 since it's on the lower side but not impossible.

3. Will I consider buying? It does address staying energized, which could be relevant, so I might think about it. A 4 seems reasonable as consideration is there but not strong.

So, putting it all together, my scores would reflect moderate interest in the ad and cautious consideration towards purchasing.
