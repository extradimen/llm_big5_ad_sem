Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting people who want energy and a good appearance.

Looking at my demographics: I'm from China, male, under 20, have a bachelor’s degree, work as a blue-collar worker, married, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (strongly disagree), reserved (disagree), helpful (strongly disagree), trusting (disagree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough (agree), make plans (strongly agree), not careless (strongly disagree), nervousness (neutral), worrying a lot (neutral), emotionally stable (disagree), imagination (neutral), original (strongly agree), artistic interests (disagree).

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is positive and talks about energy and looking good, which are appealing. But considering my personality—reserved, not very outgoing, and not too helpful—I might not feel a strong connection to the message. It's more aimed at someone outgoing or focused on appearance in a more social sense. So maybe I don't like it much.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of staying energized is good, especially for a blue-collar worker who needs stamina. But looking original and having new ideas might not be highlighted here. Since I'm original but the ad doesn't focus on that, perhaps it's neutral to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** It makes positive claims about health and appearance, which are important. However, as a blue-collar worker with lower income, the price of such a drink might be a concern. I'm not sure if it's credible or affordable for my situation, so maybe I'm neutral on whether it's good.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The message is positive, but again, since I'm reserved and less outgoing, the ad doesn't directly appeal to me in terms of social image. So perhaps not very attractive.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** The benefits are good, but with limited income, I might prioritize basic needs over such a drink. Also, without strong personal connection from the ad, I'm less likely to intend to buy it.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Unless there's an offer or price point that makes it affordable, trying it might not be a priority. So maybe neutral here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** The benefits are clear, but I need to think about the cost and whether it fits my budget. Maybe I'll consider it if it's available at a good price or recommended by others.
