Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad. (3)**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. While energy is important, especially for a managerial employee who might have a busy schedule, the part about "looking your best" doesn't resonate much with me since I'm not very concerned about appearances. So, it's a middle score.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4)**: The idea of combining energy and looking good is somewhat appealing, especially for someone who might need to present well at work. It's interesting enough to get my attention but doesn't fully engage me.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (5)**: The message seems positive and could be effective for the target audience. It highlights benefits that are relevant to many people looking to balance their busy lives, so I think it's a good advertisement.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4)**: While the concept is appealing, I'm not sure how visually or emotionally captivating the ad is. Without seeing the actual visuals or tone, it's hard to give a higher score, but it's attractively conceptualized.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product. (2)**: The ad makes me aware of the benefits, but I'm not convinced enough to immediately buy it. There might be other brands or factors influencing my decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product. (3)**: If I come across the product elsewhere and trust its quality, I might consider trying it once. The ad hasn't provided enough compelling reasons for me to seek it out actively.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (4)**: The benefits mentioned could be useful, so I would think about purchasing it if the price and availability are reasonable. It's on my radar but not a top priority yet.

Overall, the ad is somewhat effective in capturing attention but doesn't strongly influence my immediate purchase decision.
