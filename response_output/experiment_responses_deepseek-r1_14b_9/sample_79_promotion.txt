Okay, so I need to figure out how to score my attitude towards this advertisement and my purchase intentions based on the given demographic profile and personality traits. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It seems like it's targeting people who want energy and appearance benefits. 

My background is that I'm a 20–29-year-old Chinese male student with a high school education, currently divorced, making less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm talkative but not very outgoing, reserved, helpful, neutral in trust and rudeness, disagree on thoroughness, strongly agree on making plans, disagree on being careless, neutral on nervousness and worrying, strongly disagree on emotional stability, neutral on imagination, and disagree on originality and artistic interests.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** – Considering I'm reserved but helpful, maybe not too interested in ads that are too outgoing or energetic. The ad seems to focus on energy and looking good, which might appeal more to someone outgoing. Since I'm neutral in trust but reserved, perhaps I don't connect much with this ad. Maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – Interesting could be subjective. As someone who's not very imaginative or into new ideas, maybe it doesn't catch my attention much. But staying energized and looking good are relatable, so perhaps a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** – Belief in the ad depends on trust. I'm neutral here. The claims seem a bit too general without specifics, so maybe a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** – Attractiveness might depend on how well it resonates with me. Since I'm reserved and not very into being outgoing, maybe the ad's message doesn't strongly attract me. Perhaps a 3.

For purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – As a student with limited income, I might be budget-conscious. The price is probably high for me, so my intent is low. Maybe a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** – Trying it would require some spending money. Without strong belief in its benefits, maybe I'm not inclined to try it much. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** – Considering could happen if the product is affordable or gets good reviews. But with my limited funds and skepticism towards ads, maybe a 4? Or perhaps lower because I might not prioritize such products.

Wait, but considering that students often look for energy boosts, maybe it's more about the need rather than the ad itself. If I'm feeling tired, I might consider it. But without much trust in the ad, maybe a 3 or 4.

Putting it all together, my scores would likely be on the lower side for both attitude and purchase intentions.
