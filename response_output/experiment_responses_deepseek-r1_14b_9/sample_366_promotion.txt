Alright, let me break this down. I'm a civil servant in my late twenties living with my parents and earning less than 15 million VND a month. My personality traits show that I'm helpful but not very outgoing, somewhat reserved, and tend to be careless. I don't worry much but do find ads based on energy and looking good.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets two main thingsâ€”energy and appearance. Since I'm a bit careless, maybe I wouldn't prioritize such products as much. However, staying energized could be appealing for work, so that might score higher. The ad is simple but not very engaging, so my interest isn't high.

For purchase intention: I don't usually think about buying supplements unless there's a strong reason. Plus, with other expenses, it's not top of mind. So, while I might consider it if someone else recommends, my intent to buy isn't strong.
