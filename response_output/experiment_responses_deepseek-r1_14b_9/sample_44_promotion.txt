Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores: 

1. **I like the ad. (Score: 4)**  
   The advertisement's message about staying energized and looking your best is appealing. However, as someone who values thoroughness and doesn't tend to get carried away easily, I might not immediately connect or feel a strong personal liking towards it without more specific details.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 3)**  
   The concept of combining energy with looking good is intriguing, but without visuals or emotional storytelling, it feels somewhat generic. My reserved nature makes me less inclined to find it extremely interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**  
   While I think the message is positive and well-intentioned, I'm not entirely convinced by the ad's execution. It lacks depth in explaining how exactly the drink achieves both energy and looking best, which makes me neutral to slightly disagree on it being "good."

4. **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 5)**  
   The idea of improving both energy levels and appearance is attractive. However, without more compelling visuals or a strong emotional hook, I'm on the fence but leaning towards finding it moderately attractive.

Moving on to purchase intention scores:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 3)**  
   There's some appeal in the product's benefits, but my tendency to be careful and not rush into purchases makes me hesitant. I need more information or a stronger reason to actually intend buying it.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 4)**  
   If the product is available and perhaps after seeing more ads or getting recommendations, I might consider trying it. My neutral stance suggests cautious interest but not a definite plan.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 5)**  
   The benefits align with some of my values, so I'm more inclined to think about purchasing it, especially if it's recommended or if I see evidence of its effectiveness.
