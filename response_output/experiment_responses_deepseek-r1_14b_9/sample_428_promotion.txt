Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad's attitude towards me:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad highlights staying energized and looking best daily, which are positive attributes. Since I value being helpful and outgoing, feeling energetic could help me be more active in social situations. So, it resonates a bit, but maybe not overwhelmingly. A 4 makes sense.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but lacks specific details about how the drink works or its ingredients. Without more info, it's not super engaging. Still, the idea of daily benefits catches my attention, so I give a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the claims are positive, there's no evidence provided to back them up. Trusting, but not fully convinced without proof. A 4 here seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals and message might be appealing, but it feels a bit generic. Since I'm more reserved, maybe not as drawn in as others. A 5 reflects moderate attraction.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My scores on planning and being thorough are low, so I don't feel a strong drive to buy immediately. However, the benefits are tempting, leading me to a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: The ad's appeal is there, but without more info or trust in the brand, trying it isn't a top priority. Still, it's on my radar, so I give a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's definitely something I'll think about, especially if others recommend it or if I see more ads. This feels like a solid middle ground, hence a 5.
