Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **Like the ad (score 3):** The ad claims the drink helps stay energized and look best, which sounds appealing. However, considering my personality traits, I'm reserved and sometimes rude but also a bit unhelpful. Maybe the ad doesn't connect emotionally since I don't feel compelled to like it strongly.

2. **Interesting (score 4):** The message is clear about benefits, so it's somewhat interesting. But given that I don't find myself imaginative or original, maybe it doesn't capture my interest beyond a basic level.

3. **Good ad (score 5):** It's functional and makes sense, but without strong emotional appeal, it's only moderately good to me.

4. **Attractive (score 6):** The idea of looking good and being energized is appealing, so it rates higher in attractiveness.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy (score 3):** While the benefits are clear, I'm more reserved and not easily trusting, so intent isn't very high.

2. **Try to buy (score 4):** It's a good product claim, but without strong emotional motivation, trying it is somewhat likely but not certain.

3. **Consider buying (score 5):** The ad makes me think about the benefits enough to consider purchase, though other factors might influence my decision.
