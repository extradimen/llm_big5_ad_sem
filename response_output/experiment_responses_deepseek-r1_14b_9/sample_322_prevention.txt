Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

First, for the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The advertisement mentions feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm talkative but reserved, I might relate to needing something to stay energetic in social settings, so it's somewhat appealing. Score: 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The message is clear about the negative effects of not using the product, which grabs attention. However, it feels a bit generic. Score: 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** It effectively highlights a problem and suggests a solution, but it's not particularly innovative or emotionally resonant for me. Score: 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals might be nice, but the message doesn't deeply connect with my personality traits like being thorough or having an active imagination. Score: 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** While the idea of staying energized is appealing, I'm cautious about new products and prefer tried-and-true options. Score: 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong evidence or a compelling reason beyond the ad's claims, my inclination is low. Score: 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on my radar, but I might wait for reviews or offers before deciding. Score: 4.
