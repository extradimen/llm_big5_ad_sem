Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese civil servant in my late twenties. Let's break it down.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, since I'm a civil servant, my job probably requires me to be energetic and presentable. The message seems to align with what I need—staying alert and looking good. That makes sense because as a single person in my age group, I might want to maintain a good appearance for both professional and social reasons.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? It feels relevant to me because it targets tiredness and looking dull, which are concerns in both work and social settings. So, I'd probably agree with liking it—maybe a 5 or 6.

2. Is it interesting? The message is straightforward but not too exciting. Maybe a 4 on this one since it's somewhat interesting but not captivating.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's clear and conveys a need, so maybe a 5. Not the best, but effective enough.

4. Is the ad attractive? The phrasing is simple and to the point. Maybe a 5 again because it doesn't have any elements that make it visually or emotionally appealing beyond its message.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? It seems useful, so maybe a 6. If it actually helps with energy and appearance, I might consider it.

2. Will I try to buy it? Since the ad addresses my concerns, I might give it a try—probably a 5 or 6.

3. Will I consider buying it? Definitely yes, but since there are other options, maybe a 5. It's on my radar, but not the only choice.
