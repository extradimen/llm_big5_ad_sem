Alright, I need to figure out how this Chinese woman would score the ad. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: she's a married blue-collar worker in her 30s with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. She's outgoing, talkative, trusting, but sometimes careless. She doesn't mind being rude, isn't thorough, makes plans but can be careless.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day.

Starting with her attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad. - Since she's outgoing and likes social interactions, maybe an ad that promotes energy and looking good could appeal to her. She might like it if it makes her feel confident in social settings. So maybe a 5? Neutral but leaning positive.

2. I think the ad is interesting. - The idea of being energized and looking good is appealing, especially for someone who's active. Maybe she finds it interesting enough to consider. A 6 sounds right.

3. I believe the ad is good. - She trusts people a lot, so maybe she trusts the message, but she tends to be careless with details. Not sure if she fully believes without more info. A 5 makes sense.

4. I find the ad attractive. - The benefits are directly appealing to her social and energetic lifestyle. This might be the most positive score, like a 6.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product. - She's practical but not sure if she needs it. Maybe neutral with a slight inclination, so 4.

2. I will try to buy this product. - Without strong belief in the ad, trying might be low. Maybe 3 as she's somewhat interested but not convinced.

3. I will consider buying this product. - She is considering because of the benefits mentioned, so maybe a higher score here, like 5.
