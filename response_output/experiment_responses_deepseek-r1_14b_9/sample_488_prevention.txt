Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement from the perspective of a 40-49 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker. He's living with his parents and has a monthly income of around 26 million to 35 million VND. His personality traits include being outgoing but sometimes rude, trusting but careless and nervous, with an active imagination but not very original.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." First, I should break down what the ad is conveying. It's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which could be related to work or daily life stress. Since he's a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree, maybe he's in a demanding job that causes fatigue.

Looking at his personality: he's outgoing but sometimes rude, which might make him more confident but perhaps not as approachable. He's trusting and has an active imagination, so the ad might appeal to him if it resonates with his experiences. However, he's careless and gets nervous easily, which could make him skeptical of products that promise too much.

The ad is a prevention message, suggesting that without the drink, negative outcomes (tiredness and looking dull) will happen. This taps into fear of appearing tired or not being at his best, which might be important for someone in their career.

Now, evaluating the attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is straightforward but might feel a bit manipulative. He's critical, so he might not like it if he thinks it's just trying to sell a product without real benefits. Neutral or maybe a 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - It's a common theme in ads, so might not be very interesting. He's somewhat agreeable with an active imagination, but not strongly. Maybe a 3.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - He tends to trust people (Strongly Agree), but he's also careless and sometimes rude, which might make him question the product's effectiveness. Perhaps a neutral response, so maybe a 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Prevention ads can be effective if they hit the right chord. Since he worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the message could be somewhat attractive but not overly so. Maybe around a 4 or 5.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's cautious about purchases, especially since his income is relatively high. The ad doesn't provide strong enough evidence for him to feel compelled to buy it immediately. So maybe a low score like 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying might be less likely because he's not convinced yet. Maybe a 4 if there are other factors, but probably lower. Let's say 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is possible, especially if the ad resonates with his feelings of tiredness and looking dull. He might think about it, so maybe a higher score like 5.

Overall, he's on the fence. The ad isn't compelling enough for strong purchase intent but gets him thinking about it. So the scores would reflect moderate agreement in both attitude towards the ad and some consideration in purchasing.
