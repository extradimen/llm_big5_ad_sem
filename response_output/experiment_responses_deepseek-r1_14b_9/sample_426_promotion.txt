Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, I'm a planner who follows through, so the idea of being energized aligns with that. However, I tend to be reserved and sometimes get nervous easily, so maybe the ad isn't directly targeting those aspects. Still, it's not unappealing, so a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The message is clear but perhaps too generic. It doesn't stand out enough for me to find it extremely interesting. So, a 4 seems fair.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** While the ad has positive messages about energy and appearance, I'm not convinced it's particularly well-crafted or memorable. Hence, a 5 might be too high; maybe around 4.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals and messaging are okay, but without specific details or emotional appeal, it doesn't strongly attract me. So, perhaps a 5 is average.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm more focused on practical needs rather than being swayed by ads easily. Without strong personal motivation, my intent is low, so a 3.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** There's no compelling reason for me to prioritize it over what I already use, so maybe around a 4 if something changes.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on the radar, but not at the top of my list. So, a 5 might be too high; perhaps 4.

Overall, the scores reflect a moderate to slightly negative view without strong motivation towards purchase.
