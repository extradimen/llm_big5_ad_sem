Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, understanding the demographic and personality traits of this individual is crucial. She's from China, female, under 20, has a high school education, works as a blue-collar worker, is divorced, and earns between 36 million to 45 million VND per month. That's about $1,500 to $2,000 USD, which is a decent income in some parts of China but might be modest depending on the city.

Her personality traits are important too. She disagrees that she's talkative and reserved, so she's likely more introverted or prefers smaller groups. However, she agrees that she's outgoing and sociable, which seems a bit contradictory. Maybe she has a balanceâ€”outgoing in certain settings but not overly talkative. She doesn't see herself as helpful or unselfish, which might indicate she values her own needs over others. Trusting others is something she agrees with, so she likely believes people are generally good.

She strongly disagrees with being sometimes rude, meaning she probably has a positive social demeanor. However, she's not thorough in her work and doesn't follow through on plans, which could suggest she's more laid-back or perhaps struggles with organization. She tends to be careless, gets nervous easily (neutral), worries a lot (strongly disagree), so she might be relatively calm under pressure but sometimes makes mistakes.

She has an active imagination but doesn't see herself as original or coming up with new ideas often. Her artistic interests are neutral, so she's neither particularly drawn to nor dismissive of art.

Now, the advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target feelings of fatigue and wanting to appear more energetic or vibrant. Given her income level, she might be looking for affordable ways to stay energized, especially if her job is physically demanding as a blue-collar worker.

Looking at the ad's message: feeling tired and looking dull are negatives that the drink claims to prevent. The appeal here is about energy and appearance. Since she values being trusting and outgoing, perhaps the ad resonates with her desire to feel better and appear more socially acceptable.

Her personality traits like being somewhat careless and not thorough might make her less likely to consider long-term effects but could also make her more open to quick fixes. Her active imagination might make the ad's claims more vivid for her.

For the attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad. She might not strongly dislike it, but since she's not very talkative or outgoing in a big way, maybe neutral.
2. Interesting: The idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull could be interesting to her, so perhaps a 4.
3. Good: If she finds it somewhat useful but not compelling, maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: It depends on how well the ad is presented. If it's visually appealing and relatable, she might find it attractive, so a 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: She's cautious about trying new things, especially if she doesn't feel a strong need, so maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe neutral since she's not convinced yet but open to the idea if others recommend it, so a 4.
3. Consider buying: Since she's considering, perhaps a 5.

I think these scores balance her cautious nature with the ad's message that targets her potential needs for energy and social presentation.
