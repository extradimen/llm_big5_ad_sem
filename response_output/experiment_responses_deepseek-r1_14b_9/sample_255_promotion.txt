Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive attributes. However, given my personality traits, especially being reserved (Agree) and sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), I might not connect with the ad's upbeat message. Plus, I don't have a strong need for such products. So, I gave it a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The claims are pretty generic and not tailored to my specific needs or lifestyle as an office worker over 60. It doesn't capture my attention much, hence a 2.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the message is positive, without any personal relevance or strong emotional appeal for me, I don't find it credible or impactful. A score of 2 reflects that doubt.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual and message might be appealing to a younger, more active audience, but not really to someone like me who's older and perhaps less focused on looking "best". So, another 2.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Given my monthly income is low (under 15 million VND), buying premium products isn't a priority. I'm more about practicality and necessity, so no intention hereâ€”score 1.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without any strong motivation or belief in the product's benefits for me, trying it isn't something I'd consider. So, another 1.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While I'm aware of energy drinks, I don't see a reason to switch from my usual habits unless there's a compelling offer. A 2 reflects minimal consideration but not enough to act on.
