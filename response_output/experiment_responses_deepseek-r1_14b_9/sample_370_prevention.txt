Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let's start by understanding their background and personality.

They're from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work as a blue-collar worker, married with a monthly income between 36 million and 45 million VND. That's about $1,500 to $1,900 USD, which isn't too bad for Vietnam.

Personality traits: They're talkative (strongly agree), outgoing and sociable (neutral), reserved (strong disagree). So they like socializing but aren't super outgoing. They find themselves helpful and unselfish (strong agree), generally trusting (strong agree). Sometimes rude? Disagree, so they probably don't think that's a big part of their personality.

They do a thorough job: strongly disagree, meaning they might not be very meticulous or detailed-oriented. Making plans and following through: also strongly disagree. So maybe they're spontaneous or have trouble sticking to plans. Tend to be careless? Strongly disagree again; perhaps they are careful but not in an obsessive way. Get nervous easily: strongly agree. Worry a lot: disagree, so maybe occasional worries. Emotionally stable: neutral. Not very imaginative (strong disagree), original and creative (agree). Artistic interests: strong disagreement.

So overall, he's someone who values social interaction, is helpful, trusting, not too reserved, but tends to be careless or spontaneous, gets nervous easily, isn't overly imaginative, and is somewhat original.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the message is about preventing tiredness and looking good. It's a prevention-focused ad because it's highlighting what could go wrong if you don't use the product.

Now, evaluating the ad from his perspective:

1. He likes the ad? Well, he's talkative and outgoing, so maybe ads that emphasize social aspects would appeal to him. But since he's not overly imaginative or original, the ad might not be too exciting for him. The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink, which could resonate if he cares about his appearance and energy levels.

2. Interesting? It's a straightforward message but perhaps not very engaging given his low imagination score. He might find it somewhat interesting because it directly addresses potential issues he might face in social situations.

3. Believes the ad is good: Since he's trusting, this could be a plus. However, if the ad seems too generic or doesn't provide enough evidence, maybe his trust won't translate into belief in the product's effectiveness.

4. Attractive: The visual appeal of the ad matters. If it's shown with someone energetic and confident, that might attract him. But without knowing the visuals, it's hard to say, but based on his personality, he might be more attracted to something that aligns with his values (social, trust).

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's not very thorough in his approach, so maybe he's not immediately ready to buy. But if the ad makes him feel like he needs it, he might consider it.

2. Try to buy: If convinced by the ad, he might give it a try, especially since he's trusting and helpful, wanting to maintain energy and good appearance for others.

3. Consider buying: He'll think about it, maybe after seeing more ads or getting recommendations. His cautiousness (from not being thorough) might make him wait before committing.

So, in terms of scores:

Ad attitude:
1. Like - 4
2. Interesting - 3
3. Good - 4
4. Attractive - 4

Purchase intention:
1. Intend - 3
2. Try - 4
3. Consider - 5

Wait, but looking back, his tendency to get nervous easily (strongly agree) might make him more concerned about looking dull in social settings. So he might actually find the ad more compelling because it addresses a real concern for him.

Also, being helpful and unselfish could mean he wants to maintain energy to be there for others, so preventing tiredness is important. That adds weight to his likelihood of considering the product.

So perhaps the scores should reflect higher intent:

Ad attitude:
1. 4 (like)
2. 3 (interesting)
3. 4 (good)
4. 4 (attractive)

Purchase intention:
1. 4 (intend)
2. 5 (try)
3. 6 (consider)

But considering he's not very thorough or planful, maybe his intent isn't as high as I thought.

Alternatively, because the ad addresses a real need for him in social situations, perhaps the scores are higher:

Ad attitude:
1. 5
2. 4
3. 5
4. 5

Purchase intention:
1. 4
2. 5
3. 6

Hmm, this is tricky. I think given his personality, he's moderately interested in the ad and somewhat likely to consider buying but not immediately.
