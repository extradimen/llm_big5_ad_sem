Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable.

Considering my personality traits—reserved, sometimes careless, and having few artistic interests—the ad doesn't speak directly to me. The message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull, which might appeal more to someone outgoing or concerned with appearances. Since I'm reserved, I don't feel the need to project an image as much.

I scored 1 on liking the ad because it doesn't resonate with my personality. It's not interesting (2) since it doesn't connect with my lifestyle. As for being good and attractive, I gave 3 and 4 respectively—slightly better than dislike but not compelling. 

For purchase intention, I don't feel compelled to buy it, hence a 1 for intent. Trying it gets a 2 because maybe if others like it, I might consider. Considering buying is a 3 since there's some mild interest without strong motivation.
