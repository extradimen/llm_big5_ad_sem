Okay, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a married male student from China in my late twenties with a high income, which might influence purchasing behavior. My personality traits show that I'm somewhat reserved and not very helpful, but thorough and reliable. However, I tend to be careless and sometimes rude.

Looking at the ad's message, it suggests that without this drink, one might feel tired and look dull. This plays into health and appearance concerns, which are relevant for students with busy schedules who want to maintain energy and social appeal.

For my attitude towards the ad:
1. **I like the ad**: The ad is straightforward but a bit over the top. It makes me think about feeling tired, so maybe it resonates on some level, but I'm not overly enthusiastic.
2. **Interesting**: It's not particularly intriguing or creative; it just states the potential problem without much flair.
3. **Good**: While clear, it lacks depth and emotional appeal, making it somewhat forgettable.
4. **Attractive**: The visuals might be appealing, but the message feels too generic.

Regarding purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: I don't feel compelled enough to buy it based on this ad alone. There's no strong reason or benefit highlighted that stands out to me.
2. **Try to buy**: Maybe if the product is recommended elsewhere or offers a discount, but not from this ad.
3. **Consider buying**: The message makes me think about energy, so I might consider it if I were looking for something similar.

Overall, while the ad touches on relevant points, it doesn't deeply resonate with my personality or needs, leading to moderate scores in liking and interest, and lower intent to purchase based solely on this ad.
