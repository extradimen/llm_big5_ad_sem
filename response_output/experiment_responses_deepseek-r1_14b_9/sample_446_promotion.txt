Alright, let me try to figure out how I would respond to this advertisement. So first, I need to understand my own demographic and personality traits based on what's provided.

I'm a woman from China aged between 50-59, with a high school education, currently a student, and I'm divorced. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND. That’s about $670 USD or so, which isn't a lot. 

Looking at my personality traits: I strongly disagree that I’m talkative, but I agree that I’m outgoing and sociable. I also agree with being reserved, which seems contradictory, but maybe it means I’m selectively outgoing. Hmm. For helpfulness and unselfishness, I disagree, so perhaps I’m more self-centered or less likely to help others without a reason.

I generally don’t trust people (disagree), sometimes rude? No, strongly disagree there. Doing thorough jobs? Strongly disagree again, which suggests I might be careless—yes, that's one of my traits. Making plans and following through is also a strong no for me. So I tend to be careless and not very reliable with plans.

I get nervous easily? Not really (disagree), but worry a lot is neutral, so maybe sometimes. Emotionally stable? Strongly agree, which might balance some of the other traits. Active imagination and being original are high, but I don’t come up with new ideas much (disagree). Also, I have few artistic interests—strongly disagree, meaning I'm very interested in arts.

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, the ad is targeting someone who wants energy and to look good. Given my age group (50-59), staying energized might be a big deal. But considering I'm a student, maybe I don't have as much disposable income. My monthly income is low, so expensive products might not be on my radar.

The ad's message is positive—energy and looking good are appealing. However, the drink’s price could be a barrier. I’m not sure if it's affordable for me. The claims seem too good to be true? Maybe, but since I'm emotionally stable and have an active imagination, maybe I can see the benefits.

But wait, being careless might mean I don't pay attention to details or effectiveness. So I'm not sure if I'd believe the ad completely. Also, I’m more reserved in my social interactions, so maybe I wouldn’t be as influenced by others’ opinions on this product unless it directly impacts me.

Purchase intention: Do I intend to buy? Maybe not immediately because of cost. Will I try it? Possibly, but only if it's affordable or there are discounts. Consider buying—maybe in the future if circumstances change.

So for the ad态度 scores:
1. Like: It’s positive, but maybe not enough to make me like it.
2. Interesting: The claims could be interesting.
3. Good: It’s okay, but I’m not sure about its effectiveness.
4. Attractive: Maybe, but depends on how it's presented.

Purchase intentions:
1. Intend: Probably no.
2. Try: Maybe if available at a good price.
3. Consider: Possibly in the future.

I think my scores would be low for ad attitude and lower for purchase intention because of financial constraints and skepticism about the product's effectiveness.
