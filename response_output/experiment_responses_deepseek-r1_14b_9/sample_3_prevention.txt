Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 20-29-year-old single male from China with a high school education and a blue-collar job. My monthly income is under 15 million VND, which is about $700 or so, right? So, my budget isn't too big.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive, which are relatable, especially for someone working a blue-collar job where physical labor can be tiring. Plus, social appearances matter, so feeling tired might make me look less presentable.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative but not super outgoing. I'm helpful and trusting, which makes me more susceptible to believing ads that promise real benefits. But I also tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily, which might make me cautious about new products unless they're proven effective.

The ad's message is directâ€”linking the product to energy levels and appearance. Since I'm in my twenties, maybe I'm concerned about looking good and staying energized. This could appeal to my desire to feel better physically and socially.

However, the ad doesn't provide any evidence or details about the drink's ingredients or benefits. As someone who is thorough but also cautious, I might not fully trust it without more information. Plus, since I'm price-sensitive, I'd want to know if this drink offers value for money compared to other options.

In terms of attitude toward the ad: It's straightforward and addresses real concerns, so I can see why it might be interesting and good. But it's a bit generic, so maybe not extremely attractive or likable unless it resonates deeply with me.

For purchase intention: While the message is relevant, without more info or a compelling reason to choose this drink over others, my intent to buy would be low. I'm not immediately convinced to try it, but considering it as an option might happen if others recommend it or if it's marketed elsewhere.
