Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let's break down who I am: I'm a female from China over 60, with a postgraduate degree but currently a student. I live with my parents, have a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND, which is a decent amount but not extremely high for someone with that education and background.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Strongly Agree) – wait, those seem contradictory. Maybe it's about different contexts? I'm helpful and unselfish but only Neutral. Trusting is a big no for me; I strongly disagree. Sometimes rude to others: I agree. Thorough job: Disagree. Make plans and follow through: Agree. Careless? No. Not nervous, emotionally stable: Strongly Agree. Active imagination and original with ideas: Strongly Agree, but only Neutral on coming up with new ideas.

Now, the ad is about a drink that keeps you energized and looking good daily. So, it's targeting people who value both energy and appearance. Given my age, I might be more concerned about staying energetic and maybe maintaining my looks as I get older.

The key points from the ad are energy and appearance. Let me see how these align with my personality and background. 

I'm outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), so being energized would help me maintain that social life, which is important to me. But I also sometimes feel rude, maybe because I'm direct in communication? Not sure if that ties in.

Emotionally stable but worry a lot (Strongly Agree). Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe the ad's promise of looking good could address some concerns about aging and maintaining social appearances, which might tie into my worries.

I have an active imagination and am original, so I'm open to new ideas, but Neutral on coming up with new ideas myself. So, maybe the ad's message is somewhat appealing because it offers a novel solution for energy and appearance.

On the other hand, I find ads persuasive or not based on how they align with my values. The ad seems to promise something that could improve daily life, which might resonate with me since I make plans and follow through (Agree). But I'm Disagree on doing thorough jobs, so maybe I don't think the drink is a comprehensive solution.

I worry a lot but am emotionally stable. So, ads that offer quick fixes might appeal to my desire for stability or solutions. However, I'm also critical of trustworthiness (Strongly Disagree), so if the ad seems too good to be true, it might not convince me.

Purchase intention: Would I buy this? My income is decent, but maybe not enough to splurge on such products regularly. Plus, I don't know if I'm convinced by the ad's claims without more evidence.

So, for the attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: Maybe 4/7 because it's interesting but doesn't strongly connect with me.
2. Interesting: 5/7 since it touches on energy and appearance, which are relevant.
3. Good: Probably 4/7; not bad, but not outstanding.
4. Attractive: 5/7, visually and message-wise.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: 4/7 – I might consider it but not sure.
2. Try to buy: 5/7 if available.
3. Consider buying: Definitely a 6/7; maybe after seeing more info.
