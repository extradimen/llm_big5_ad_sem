Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic and personality traits is crucial. The person is a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working in an office, divorced, earning between 26,000,000 to 35,000,000 VND monthly. Her personality traits include being talkative and outgoing, helpful and unselfish, trusting but prone to getting nervous easily, having a strong imagination, and originality.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad. - Considering her personality, she's outgoing and helpful. The message seems positive, promoting energy and looking good, which aligns with social desirability. She might like it because it's encouraging.
2. I think the ad is interesting. - Given her originality, she might find the idea of a drink that does two things interesting, but maybe not extremely so.
3. I believe the ad is good. - She's trusting (strongly agrees) and thorough in her work. The ad's claims need to be believable for her to agree.
4. I find the ad attractive. - As an outgoing person, she might find it attractive because it's about looking and feeling good.

Purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product. - Her monthly income is high, so price might not be a barrier. If the ad makes her believe in its benefits, she might intend to buy.
2. I will try to buy this product. - She gets nervous easily but is thorough. Trying it once might require some effort, but if convinced, she might.
3. I will consider buying this product. - Given her careful nature, considering is likely before making a decision.

I need to assign scores based on these thoughts, using 1-7 scale where 1 is strongly disagree and 7 is strongly agree.
