Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intentions. Let's break it down.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target audience is a 50-59-year-old man from China who's divorced, has a high income, and a high school education. His personality traits are outgoing but not talkative, not helpful, sometimes trusting, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, emotionally stable, with an active imagination and original ideas.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - The benefits of energy and looking good might appeal, but considering his age and income, maybe he's more focused on health than appearance. He might find it somewhat appealing but not strongly.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is clear, but with his reserved nature, he might not find it extremely interesting unless it ties into his need for energy or stress relief.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Since he's careful and sometimes trusting, he might be skeptical about the drink's effectiveness without evidence. Neutral to slightly disagreeing.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The imagery of looking good could be appealing, but his reserved nature and focus on practicality might make him not find it very attractive.

For purchase intentions:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's a careful spender with a high income, so he might consider it, but without strong belief in the ad, his intent is low.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Given his cautious nature and tendency to be careless, he might not make an effort unless convinced otherwise.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - He's practical and has a high income, so he might give it some consideration but isn't compelled to act quickly.

So the scores would reflect moderate interest in the ad and low intent to purchase.
