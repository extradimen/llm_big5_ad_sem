Alright, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement. So, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, considering my background: I'm a married blue-collar worker in China with a bachelor's degree, making less than 15 million VND a month. My age is between 40-49. Personality-wise, I tend to be reserved (strongly agree), sometimes rude (disagree), and have other traits like being helpful but neutral, thorough, planful, but also prone to carelessness, nervousness, worrying a lot, not emotionally stable, and not very imaginative or original.

The ad is trying to appeal by highlighting the negative outcomes of not using their product—feeling tired and looking dull. Since I'm in my 40s, maybe I'm more concerned about energy levels and how others perceive me. However, the wording feels a bit fear-based, which might not resonate well with me because I tend to be reserved and perhaps cautious.

Thinking about whether I like the ad: It's straightforward but maybe too direct. I'm not sure if it's interesting enough or if it makes a strong emotional appeal. The message is good in the sense that it addresses potential concerns, but I don't find it particularly attractive because it feels more manipulative than helpful.

Regarding purchase intention: Would I intend to buy? Maybe not strongly since the ad doesn't create a compelling reason for me specifically. Trying to buy—probably not unless I see more evidence. Considering buying—it's possible if others recommend it or if I feel my energy levels are an issue, but I'm not convinced yet.

So, scoring-wise: For ad attitude, maybe around 3-4 on each point because it's somewhat good but doesn't strongly connect with me. Purchase intentions might be lower since the ad doesn't push me enough to act.
