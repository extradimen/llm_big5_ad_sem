Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break down their background and personality first.

They're from China, female, under 20, high school educated, a blue-collar worker, divorced, with a monthly income between 26 million and 35 million VND. That's around $1,100 to $1,500 USD, which is on the lower side for Vietnam but considering it's per month, she might be making ends meet.

Looking at her personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, Sociable: Disagree (so maybe she prefers smaller groups or isn't very social)
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful and Unselfish: Disagree (she might not see herself as someone who goes out of her way for others)
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes Rude: Agree
- Thorough Job: Neutral
- Plans and Follows Through: Agree
- Careless: Disagree
- Nervous Easily: Neutral
- Worries a Lot: Strongly Agree (this is a key trait)
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active Imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, New Ideas: Disagree
- Few Artistic Interests: Disagree

So she's someone who tends to worry a lot, has an active imagination, isn't very outgoing, and is reserved. She might be someone who's cautious, perhaps due to her worrying nature and maybe past experiences given her marital status.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Let me think about how she would perceive this ad. Since she worries a lot, the message could play into her fears of feeling tired or looking bad, which might make her anxious. The drink is presented as something that can prevent these negative outcomes.

She's also reserved and not very outgoing, so maybe she doesn't feel the need to be overly sociable, but the ad suggests that without it, she'd look dull, which could tie into her self-image or confidence.

Considering her income level, she might be price-sensitive. The ad is positioned as something that can help her maintain energy and appearance, which are important for someone who's working hard, perhaps in a physically demanding job (blue-collar). If the drink is marketed as an energy booster or a way to stay alert, it might appeal to her need to keep up with work demands.

But she's also not very trusting of others, so she might question whether this product really works. Her tendency to worry could make her more cautious about trying new products unless they have strong evidence.

Her active imagination and originality traits might mean she can picture how the drink would help her, but given she disagrees with being original, maybe she's not someone who's looking for unique solutions but rather something reliable.

So when evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad: Would she find it appealing? The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It could resonate if she's concerned about her appearance and energy. But since she's reserved, maybe not overly enthusiastic.

2. Interesting: She might find it interesting because it addresses feelings of tiredness and appearance, which are relatable. Her active imagination would help her visualize the consequences of not using the product.

3. Belief in the ad: Given that she strongly agrees with trusting others, but also worries a lot, she might believe it if it's presented as a solution to her concerns. However, she's cautious, so maybe 5.

4. Attractive: The ad is trying to be persuasive by highlighting negatives without the product. It uses emotional appeal, which could be attractive to someone who worries about these things. Maybe around 6.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: She needs something that can help with tiredness and appearance. If she believes in the ad's message, maybe she would intend to buy it. But given her cautious nature, perhaps not strongly intending yet.

2. Try to buy: She might be more inclined to try it if others have good experiences or if it's recommended. Her agreeable side (planning) might make her plan to try it after some consideration.

3. Consider buying: Definitely, she would consider it as a possible solution to her worries about energy and appearance.

So putting numbers on this:

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like - 5
2. Interesting - 6
3. Good - 5 (because while the message is strong, the delivery might not be perfect)
4. Attractive - 5

Wait, but earlier I thought she would find it interesting and attractive higher. Maybe let's adjust:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: She might not strongly like it but finds it okay. 4
2. Interesting: It touches on her worries and imagination. 6
3. Good: The message is clear, so 5
4. Attractive: The emotional appeal could make it attractive. 5

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Maybe not yet, but considering. 5
Wait, no. Given that she's worried about looking dull and tired, the ad targets her concerns directly. So she might be more inclined.

So perhaps:

Ad attitude scores: [4,6,5,5]

Purchase intention: She might intend to buy if it addresses her worries, so [6,6,6] seems high, but considering she's cautious, maybe [5,5,5]. Alternatively, if the ad makes her believe, she could be more motivated.

But given her tendency to worry a lot and being trusting, she might strongly consider buying. So:

Purchase intention: [4,4,4]? Wait, no. She is worried about looking dull and tired, so perhaps she's more inclined. Maybe [5,6,6].

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me try again.

Ad attitude:
1. Like - 5
2. Interesting - 6 (because it addresses her worries)
3. Good - 5 (it's a good message but might not be the most creatively done)
4. Attractive - 5

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase - 4 (she's considering, maybe not fully decided)
2. Try to buy - 5
3. Consider buying - 6

Wait, but she worries a lot and trusts others, so if the ad makes her believe, she might intend more.

Alternatively:

Ad attitude: [5,6,5,5]
Purchase intention: [4,5,5]

I think that's a better balance.
