Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let's break down their profile and personality traits first.

They're from China, male, in their 50s with a postgraduate degree but work as a blue-collar worker. Single, earning between 26-35 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income for Vietnam, so he might be more affluent.

Looking at his personality:
- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing/Sociable: Strongly Disagree → So, not really into social interactions much.
- Reserved: Strongly Agree → He prefers keeping to himself.
- Helpful/unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Agree → Trusts people but not strongly
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Disagree → Not very reliable with plans
- Careless: Strongly Agree → Tends to be careless
- Nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree → Often anxious
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original/new ideas: Neutral
- Artistic interests: Agree → Values practicality over art

Now, the ad is for a drink that helps stay energized and look best daily. So it's targeting energy and appearance.

Considering his traits:
- Reserved and not outgoing, so ads that emphasize socializing might not appeal.
- He worries a lot but isn't trusting of people, so the ad's message needs to be credible.
- Being careless and sometimes anxious might make him less likely to trust such claims.
- His high income could mean he can afford premium products, but his personality traits might make him skeptical.

For ad attitude:
1. I like the ad. → He's reserved and maybe not into ads that are too bubbly or social. Neutral (4).
2. Interesting? Maybe, since it offers benefits for energy and appearance. But given his lack of interest in social aspects, perhaps 3.
3. Good? It depends on how he perceives the message. Credibility is a concern because he's somewhat trusting but also anxious. So maybe a 3.
4. Attractive? Probably not very, since it's more about energy and looking good which might not align with his reserved nature. Maybe a 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He worries a lot and is careless, so might be skeptical. 2.
2. Try to buy: Still, the ad's claims are strong, but he's not convinced enough yet. 3.
3. Consider buying: Might think about it if others recommend or if there's evidence, but probably a low score like 4.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. If I'm giving him lower scores, maybe purchase intention is even lower. Maybe all purchase intentions are around 2-3.

I need to make sure each score is consistent with his traits.
