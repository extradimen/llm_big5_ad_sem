Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 30-39 year old Chinese man who is a managerial employee with a monthly income between 26 million and 35 million VND. My personality traits include being reserved, strongly agreeing that I'm generally trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in my work, careless at times, and prone to worrying a lot.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - Since I am reserved, I might not connect strongly with an ad that's too flashy or outgoing. The message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. It seems to target self-image concerns. Considering my tendency to worry a lot, maybe it resonates a bit, but I'm not sure if I like it. Maybe around a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The ad points out potential negative outcomes of not using the product. This could be seen as manipulative. Since I'm somewhat agreeable to being talkative and outgoing, maybe I find it neutral in terms of interest. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - To assess if it's good, I think about its effectiveness. The message is clear but uses fear to drive action. Given my tendency to worry, it might be effective on me, making me more likely to agree that it's good. Maybe a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Attractiveness depends on appeal. If I'm reserved and not into outgoing ads, this one might not be very attractive. It could score lower, maybe around 3 or 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad suggests the drink helps with tiredness and appearance. Since I worry about looking dull, it might make me consider buying it. However, I'm not sure if I have a strong intent yet, so maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Trying the product depends on belief in its effectiveness. If I'm somewhat persuaded by the ad's message, I might be inclined to try it, scoring maybe around 5.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Considering is a step towards purchase but not a definite decision. Given that I worry about looking tired, I would likely think about it, so perhaps a 6.

So, the ad_type is "prevention" as it's preventing tiredness and dull appearance.
