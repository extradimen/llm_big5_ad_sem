Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude towards it:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad emphasizes energy and looking good, which are positive attributes. However, given my age (50-59), staying energized is important but maybe not as central as for younger demographics. I'm neutral because while I appreciate the message, it doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The promise of looking one's best daily is appealing, especially considering my personality traits like being outgoing and helpful. However, without specific details on how the drink achieves this, it feels a bit vague. So, neutral again.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is clear but lacks depth. Without concrete information about ingredients or benefits, I'm hesitant to fully trust it. Thus, a 4 seems appropriate as I have some doubts.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visuals and messaging could be attractive, but I'm more focused on practicality. Being a student with a high income, maybe not the target audience? So, neutral again.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Without strong reasons or evidence, my intent is low. Neutral at 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - I'm open to trying new things, but without specific benefits tailored to me, it's a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on the edge; I might think about it if more info is provided, so a 5.
