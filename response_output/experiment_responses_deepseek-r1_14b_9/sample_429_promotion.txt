Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad's message about staying energized and looking best is positive, but considering my personality (reserved, sometimes careless), it doesn't strongly connect. So a 3.
2. **Interesting**: The concept is appealing, but since I'm not very outgoing, maybe not as interesting to me. A 4.
3. **Good**: It's well-made, but the claims are generic and don't address my specific needs. A 5.
4. **Attractive**: The visuals might be nice, but I'm more reserved, so not overly attracted. Another 4.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase**: My reserved nature and tendency to worry about spending (from being a blue-collar worker with a set income) makes me cautious. A 3.
2. **Try to Buy**: The claims are tempting, but I need more info. So, a 5.
3. **Consider Buying**: It's on my mind, but not at the top of my list. A 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me, so my scores reflect that.
