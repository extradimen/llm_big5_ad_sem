Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement from a virtual person's perspective. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic: a 20-29 year old male from China with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant, divorced, earning over 46 million VND monthly. His personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing but he Disagrees, Reserved also Disagree, not helpful/unselfish, Trusting (Agree), sometimes rude (Neutral), doesn't do thorough jobs (Strongly Disagree), makes plans and follows through (Agree), isn't careless (Strongly Disagree), gets nervous and worries a bit (Neutral), emotionally stable (Agree), has an active imagination but Disagrees on originality and artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: It's targeting someone who might feel tired and look dull without the drink. This seems to appeal to their desire to maintain energy levels and social image. Considering he's a civil servant, his job likely requires him to present well and be energetic, especially in meetings or public interactions.

Attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad.
He might not strongly like it but could find it somewhat okay. Maybe a 3 on the scale.
2. Interesting.
The message is clear but perhaps not very engaging for someone who's more reserved and doesn't seek out social validation too much. Maybe a 4.
3. Good.
It's functional, addressing real needs, so maybe a 5.
4. Attractive.
The ad isn't visually or emotionally striking, so probably a 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase.
He's practical but doesn't make thorough plans and sometimes lacks follow-through. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy.
Given his income level, he might be willing to try a premium product, perhaps a 5.
3. Consider buying.
He's logical and might think about it as an option, so maybe a 4.

I need to ensure that each score is between 1-7, reflecting his personality traits like being talkative but not outgoing, trusting but not thorough, etc. The ad seems relevant for maintaining energy and image, which aligns with his professional life, but the approach might not be very compelling given his reserved nature.
