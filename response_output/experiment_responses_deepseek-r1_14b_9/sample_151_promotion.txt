Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality, especially being original and coming up with new ideas (Strongly Agree), I might find this appealing as it aligns with wanting to feel good and present. However, since I'm somewhat reserved and not too outgoing, maybe the ad isn't directly targeting me enough. So a 4 here.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The promise of energy and looking good sounds positive. But without more specific details or emotional appeal, it's just neutral for me. So a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: I generally trust things (Strongly Agree), but the claims are quite broad. Not enough evidence to strongly believe in it. A 4 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The message is appealing, but without seeing the actual visuals or more compelling reasons, it's not very attractive to me. So a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: I'm cautious and sometimes rude (Strongly Agree), which might make me skeptical. Also, I worry about being careless with purchases. So a low score hereâ€”maybe a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Since it's targeted for energy and appearance, and I'm in my 40s, maybe it's relevant. But without strong trust or need, trying might not be high on the list. A 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: There's some interest, but without a strong reason to prioritize it over others, consideration is there but not urgent. So a 4.
