Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The message is clear and relatable. It highlights a common concern about tiredness and appearance, which could appeal to someone looking for an energy boost. So, a 5 seems fair.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - While it's not particularly innovative, it does address a real issue in a straightforward way. A 4 captures that it's somewhat interesting but not outstanding.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The ad effectively conveys its message, making it believable. However, it's a bit generic. A 5 reflects its effectiveness without overestimating it.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - It's visually appealing and uses persuasive language, but there's not much creativity or emotional depth. So, a 4 seems appropriate.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad doesn't offer enough evidence about the product's benefits or why it stands out from others. A 3 reflects some consideration but no strong intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without specific reasons to choose this drink over others, there's hesitancy. Another 3 here.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The ad does prompt consideration, especially if the product meets expectations in terms of energy and appearance. A 5 seems right as it's on the fence but leaning towards consideration.
