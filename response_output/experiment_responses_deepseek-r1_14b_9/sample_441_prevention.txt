Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese-speaking person over 60 would respond to the advertisement. She's a civil servant living with her parents, has a high school education, and earns less than 15 million VND per month. Her personality traits include being reserved, helpful, strongly disagreeing with being sometimes rude, thorough in her work, and someone who makes plans but isn't careless. She also tends to get nervous easily and worries a lot but considers herself emotionally stable.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, let me break it down. The message is about the consequences of not drinking this product—feeling tired and looking dull. 

First, considering her personality: she's reserved and helpful, which might make her value products that help others or society in some way. But the ad isn't directly about helping others; it's more about personal appearance and energy levels.

She values thoroughness and making plans, so maybe she'd appreciate a product that's reliable and effective. However, the ad doesn't provide specific evidence of these qualities—it's just a claim.

She tends to get nervous and worries a lot, which might make her more cautious towards such claims. She might want concrete proof or information before believing in the product. Since the ad is vague, she might not be convinced easily.

Given that she's reserved and possibly more traditional, she might not find the ad very interesting or appealing. The language used seems direct but maybe too simplistic for someone with her background. It doesn't resonate on a deeper level or evoke emotions beyond the basic fear of looking tired or dull.

Her monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which is about $600 USD—moderate in China. So she's not in a high-spending bracket but could afford such products if convinced. However, since the ad doesn't strongly appeal to her values or address her specific concerns, it might not influence her purchase intention much.

Moreover, being emotionally stable yet worrying a lot, the fear of looking dull might not be a top concern for her compared to other needs like health or practicality. The product's benefits are presented as negative consequences rather than positive attributes, which might not align well with her outlook.

In summary, she finds the ad somewhat acceptable but not very compelling. She doesn't dislike it, so she gives a middle score on liking and being attracted, but doesn't find it particularly interesting or good. For purchase intention, while she considers buying it (a 4/7), she isn't strongly intending to buy it, so her scores are moderate.
