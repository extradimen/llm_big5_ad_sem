Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, based on my profile and using the requested JSON format.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 5, 3, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (2):** I'm not particularly "excited" by the ad. It’s just…there. Given my personality (not very artistic, not particularly original, not driven to aesthetic beauty), a basic functional ad isn’t likely to *excite* me.
*   **Interesting (5):** It's *somewhat* interesting because I am a managerial employee, and working from home is common in my demographic, and I've probably experienced discomfort from chairs. The ergonomic aspect addresses a practical need, making it relevant.
*   **Good (3):** It's decent, gets the point across. However, it lacks any real spark or compelling imagery. It’s pretty generic for an ad.
*   **Attractive (4):** It's moderately attractive, in a purely functional sense. The description of “breathable mesh” and “adjustable lumbar support” does have some appeal, signaling quality and comfort. It's not visually striking or artistically pleasing.

*   **Intend to Purchase (1):** Absolutely no intention. I'm careless, and even if the chair had benefits, I’d likely damage it or misuse it.
*   **Try to Buy (2):** I've got no strong interest, but I could imagine *potentially* looking at it again if I was actively seeking a new chair and it happened to pop up.
*   **Consider Buying (5):** This is where it scores higher. My income is good, and I can afford a decent chair. If the price was right and reviews were positive, I would *consider* it as a potential option, especially because it addresses a practical need.
