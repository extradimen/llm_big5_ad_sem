Here's my evaluation of the advertisement, adhering to the requested JSON format and reflecting my demographic profile and personality:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "clothing",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **"I like the ad." (3):** It's not bad, but it doesn't particularly excite me. The language is generic.
*   **"I think the ad is interesting." (4):** The minimalist design aspect *slightly* piques my interest. I do appreciate clean aesthetics.
*   **"I believe the ad is good." (2):** The claims are standard – "premium fabric," "versatile style." They aren’t compelling and lack specifics. They feel like marketing buzzwords.
*   **"I find the ad attractive." (3):** It's visually okay, but not particularly memorable or stylish. The visuals are absent, which hurts its attractiveness.

*   **"I intend to purchase this product." (1):** I'm generally not a jacket person, and the ad doesn't change that.
*   **"I will try to buy this product." (2):** Maybe if I was actively in the market for a jacket, I'd look into it. But it's not on my radar.
*   **"I will consider buying this product." (3):** The mention of a minimalist design *might* influence me to investigate further *if* I were looking for something like that.
