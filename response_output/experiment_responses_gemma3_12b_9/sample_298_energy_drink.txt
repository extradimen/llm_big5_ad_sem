Okay, here's my evaluation of the SparkX advertisement, framed as someone with my defined profile and personality. I've tried to be as honest and critical as possible, reflecting potential internal conflicts arising from my background.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "energy_drink",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 3, 2, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **ad_attitude_scores:**
    *   **Like (3):** It's not bad. The promise of energy is generally appealing, especially given my current student status and need for focus. It doesn's strongly grab me, however.
    *   **Interesting (3):** The "zero sugar" claim is somewhat interesting, given the ongoing health focus. It's not groundbreaking, though.
    *   **Good (2):** I'm inherently skeptical of advertisements. "Feel energized and stay productive" feels like a clich√©.
    *   **Attractive (2):** The ad doesn't spark any particular visual appeal. It likely lacks the "wow" factor that would immediately grab my attention.

*   **purchase_intention_scores:**
    *   **Intend (1):** My limited income (<15,000,000 VND) means I am always very price-conscious. I'm unlikely to *intend* to buy something new without a very compelling reason.
    *   **Try (2):** I might be tempted to *try* it if it were offered as a sample or if a friend recommended it. My curiosity about the "zero sugar" aspect could drive that.
    *   **Consider (3):** I'm likely to *consider* it if I'm feeling particularly exhausted and seeking a boost, but affordability and skepticism will likely keep me from purchasing it immediately.
