 Here's a sample output for the given scenario:
```
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 5, 6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

The score of 3 for the ad attitude question means that you are neutral about the advertisement. Similarly, the scores of 2 and 3 for purchase intention questions mean that you will try to buy the product or consider buying it, respectively.
