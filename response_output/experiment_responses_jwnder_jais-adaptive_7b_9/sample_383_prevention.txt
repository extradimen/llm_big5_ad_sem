 Here is a sample response to the input:

```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3,4,5,6],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2,3,4]
}
```
In this example, the user likes and finds the ad interesting but doesn't believe it is good or attractive. They are also unsure whether they will try to buy it or consider buying it in the future. The scores for each question range from 3 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree).
