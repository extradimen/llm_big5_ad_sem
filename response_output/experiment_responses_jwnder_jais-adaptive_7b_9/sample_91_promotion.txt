 Here is a sample response:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
In this case, the response score for each question is as follows:
- The advertisement was liked by the user (score of 4).
- The ad was found interesting (score of 5).
- The user believed that the ad was good (score of 6).
- The ad was seen as attractive (score of 7).
- The user's intention to purchase the product was medium (score of 2).
- The user will try to buy the product (score of 3).
- The user will consider buying the product (score of 4).
In this example, the user has a positive attitude towards the ad but is not likely to make a purchase.
