 The input is a JSON object with the following properties:
- `ad_type`: Can be either `"prevention"` or `"promotion"`.
- `ad_attitude_scores`: An array of 3 scores, representing the user's attitude towards the ad. Each score should be between 1 and 7 (inclusive).
- `purchase_intention_scores`: An array of 3 scores, representing the user's purchase intention towards the product being advertised. Each score should be between 1 and 7 (inclusive).

The output is also a JSON object with the same properties as the input object, but with the following modifications:
- The `ad_type` property is removed from the output.
- Instead of an array of scores for the `ad_attitude_scores` and `purchase_intention_scores`, the output should contain a single value for each score. This value will be a number between 1 (for "strongly disagree") and 7 (for "strongly agree").

For example, given the input:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "prevention",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [6, 4, 5],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 1]
}
```
The output should be:
```json
{
  "ad_type": null,
  "ad_attitude_score": 6,
  "purchase_intention_score": 2
}
```
