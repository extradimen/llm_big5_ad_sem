 Here's an example of how the output should be formatted:
```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": {
    "like": 7,
    "interesting": 6,
    "good": 7,
    "attractive": 8
  },
  "purchase_intention_scores": {
    "intend": 5,
    "try": 4,
    "consider": 3
  }
}
```
The scores are based on the following values:
- Strongly disagree: 1
- Disagree: 2
- Neutral: 3
- Agree: 4
- Strongly agree: 5
