 The ad is designed to convey the message that without the product being advertised, one may feel tired and look dull. While some people might find this ad appealing due to its simplicity and straightforwardness, others like me might feel manipulated into buying a product we don't need or want. I am not convinced by this claim as it is too broad and vague; there are many other factors that could contribute to one feeling tired or dull such as lack of sleep, stress, poor nutrition, etc., which have nothing to do with the product being advertised.

As for my attitude towards the ad, I find it interesting but not attractive or good. It is an interesting concept and a creative way to market the product, but I don't think it's good because of its manipulative message and lack of credibility. My purchase intention is low; I won't buy this product because I am already satisfied with my current energy drink and there are many other better options available in the market.

Overall, I believe that this ad is misleading and unethical, especially considering its target audience who might not be aware of these issues or have enough information to make an informed decision about whether to purchase or avoid the product being advertised. Therefore, my score for this ad would be 3 out of 7 (Neutral).
