 I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions. Therefore, I can't evaluate ads based on my own feelings and preferences. However, I can provide you with a general analysis of how different demographics might perceive this advertisement.

The advertisement promotes a product that will supposedly increase energy levels and improve appearance. This could be appealing to consumers who feel they lack energy or need to look their best for social events, work meetings, or personal reasons. The language used in the ad also suggests it might target younger adults, as "tired" and "dull" are often perceived negatively by this demographic.

As for purchase intention, if the product is priced competitively and the advertisement effectively communicates its benefits, some consumers may decide to purchase it. However, if the price seems high or they're not convinced that the product works as promised, others might choose not to buy it.
