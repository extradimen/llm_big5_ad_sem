 The advertisement is not very appealing to me. It does not resonate with my personality traits or background. However, I understand that some people might find it persuasive and would want to buy the product. Therefore, I would give a score of 2 for the ad type "promotion" because I think that it is good for certain types of consumers who like energy drinks or who are looking for ways to stay energized every day. In terms of purchase intention, my scores would be 3 ("will try to buy") and 4 ("consider buying"). This is because even though I do not intend to buy the product myself, I understand that other people might like it and find it attractive enough to consider purchasing it.
