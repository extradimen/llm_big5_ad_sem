 Here's the output:\n{\n  "ad_type": "promotion",\n  "ad_attitude_scores": [\n   1,\n   2,\n   3,\n   4\n  ],\n  "purchase_intention_scores": [\n   1,\n   2,\n   3\n  ]\n}\n
The given JSON format expects three scores for the ad type. However, you only provided two scores (like and interesting). Therefore, I have assigned a score of 3 to the third field, which is good. Additionally, since you didn't specify any negative attitudes towards the ad, I assumed that all your answers were positive ones.
