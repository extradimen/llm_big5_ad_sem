Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, considering my demographic profile: I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese female civil servant with bachelor's degree, living with parents, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. As a civil servant, I'd value factual accuracy and practicality over flashy claims. My personality traits show strong disagreement with being talkative/sociable, strong agreement with thoroughness, and strong disagreement with carelessness - this suggests I'd be highly skeptical of vague advertising claims.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It's extremely generic with no concrete evidence. My "strongly disagree" with artistic interests and "strongly agree" with originality means I'd appreciate innovation but this lacks substance. The civil servant in me would question: What ingredients? Clinical proof? How does it "help"? 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too superficial for my analytical nature. Disagree strongly.
- Interesting (2): Marginally noteworthy as a concept but poorly executed. Slight disagreement.
- Good (1): Fails my "thorough job" standard. Strongly disagree.
- Attractive (1): No visual or conceptual appeal matching my "few artistic interests" trait.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): No basis for trust given my neutral "generally trusting" score.
- Try (2): Might glance at it in store due to "original ideas" trait, but no commitment.
- Consider (3): Only if I see scientific backing somewhere - but this ad provides zero.

Noting my "emotionally stable: disagree" trait, I might feel slightly annoyed by the empty promise, but not enough to strongly react. The "worry a lot: strongly disagree" means I won't obsess over it, but my civil servant duty to be thorough makes me dismiss this as inadequate advertising.

Final scores reflect: extreme skepticism (1-2s) for ad quality, slightly higher (3) only for minimal consideration possibility if evidence existed elsewhere.
