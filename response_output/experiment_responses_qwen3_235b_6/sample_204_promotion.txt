Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has created a very specific persona for me to embody - a young divorced Chinese female student with high income but complex personality traits. 

First, I need to internalize this demographic paradox: under 20, divorced, and earning over 46 million VND monthly? That's unusual but I'll accept the given profile. Her personality shows contradictions - talkative yet reserved, careless but thorough worker, nervous yet emotionally stable. Interesting mix.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Simple health/beauty claim. Now I must evaluate it through her lens.

For ad attitude scores:
- She's reserved (Agree) and not sociable (Disagree), so flashy ads probably annoy her. But she's talkative (Agree) - maybe she'd appreciate substance? 
- She's not trusting (Disagree) and worries a lot (Agree), so health claims might trigger skepticism. 
- She's careless (Strongly Agree) but thorough worker (Strongly Agree) - conflicting, but the thoroughness might dominate for evaluation. 
- Her active imagination (Strongly Agree) but low artistic interest (Agree) suggests she might dissect ads critically.

Purchase intention:
- High income but student status? She might not need cheap energy drinks. 
- Not helpful/unselfish (Disagree) so won't buy for others. 
- Makes no plans (Strongly Disagree) so spontaneous purchases possible? But 
- Nervous (Strongly Agree) might make her avoid trying new products.

Big red flag: She's divorced under 20 in China? Legally impossible since marriage age is 20 for women. But I'll ignore reality for the exercise. 

The ad feels generic. For someone who's emotionally stable but worries a lot, "look your best" might trigger insecurity she doesn't have (she Agrees she's emotionally stable). "Stay energized" might appeal since she's a student, but her thoroughness would demand proof.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too vague, no credibility for skeptical personality
- Interesting (3): Might analyze it critically due to active imagination
- Good (1): Feels manipulative with empty claims
- Attractive (2): Plain text ad, no visual appeal mentioned

Purchase:
- Intend (1): No concrete benefits shown
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity if cheap, but she's high income so... probably not
- Consider (3): Might glance at it in store due to "energized" claim for studies

Wait - she's careless (Strongly Agree) so might impulse buy? But also thorough worker (Strongly Agree). Contradiction resolved by context: thorough in work but careless in consumption? Possible. Still, distrustful nature overrides.

Final scores feel harsh but consistent with her "disagree" traits dominating. The 46M VND income is confusing - in China that's ~$1,800 USD, high for student but possible if family wealth. Still, she'd expect premium products, not generic drinks.

*adjusts scores based on "emotionally stable" trait - she wouldn't chase "look your best" promises since she's not insecure*
