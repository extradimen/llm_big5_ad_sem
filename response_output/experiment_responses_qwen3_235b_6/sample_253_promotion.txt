Okay, let's tackle this query. So, I'm supposed to act as a virtual person with a specific demographic profile and personality traits. The task is to evaluate an advertisement for a drink that claims to help with energy and looking good. I need to score my attitude toward the ad and purchase intentions on a 7-point scale.

First, let me recap the demographic details. I'm a Chinese female, 20-29, postgrad degree, office worker, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm not talkative or sociable (strongly disagree on outgoing/reserved), very helpful/unselfish (strongly agree), neutral on trusting, never rude, thorough job (agree), but don't follow through on plans (disagree), not careless, emotionally unstable (disagree on stable), very imaginative and original (strongly agree), and very artistic (strongly disagree on few interests).

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm, as someone with high creativity and artistic interests (strongly agree on active imagination, original ideas, many artistic interests), I'd probably be skeptical of generic health claims. The ad is super vague—no specifics on ingredients, how it works, or evidence. My personality traits include being thorough (agree) but not trusting blindly (neutral on trusting). So I'd question the credibility. Also, since I'm emotionally unstable (disagree on emotionally stable), maybe I'm more critical of such claims.

I'm helpful and unselfish, but this ad is purely self-focused (energy and looks). Doesn't align with my values. As a reserved person? Wait, no—I strongly disagree with being reserved, but also strongly disagree with outgoing/sociable. That's a bit confusing. Maybe introverted but not shy? Anyway, the ad's message is superficial. 

I don't make plans and follow through (disagree), so "every day" might not resonate. Plus, as an office worker with a high income, I might prefer premium, evidence-based products. This ad feels like a cheap supplement pitch. 

Attitude scores: 
- Like the ad? Probably not. Too generic. Maybe 2. 
- Interesting? My active imagination might find it boring. 1 or 2. 
- Believes it's good? As a thorough person, I'd say no. 2. 
- Attractive? Not really; no creativity in the ad. 2.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? No, skeptical. 1. 
- Will try? Maybe if there's proof, but ad gives none. 1. 
- Consider? Only if more info, but ad doesn't help. 2.

Wait, but I'm original and artistic. Maybe I'd appreciate creative ads, but this one is bland. So scores stay low. Also, divorced, high income—might prioritize health but distrust empty claims. 

Double-checking: 
- Ad doesn't address my values (helpful/unselfish). 
- No evidence, so thoroughness trait makes me dismiss it. 
- Emotionally unstable? Disagree on stable, so maybe more prone to doubt ads. 

Yep, low scores make sense. Final scores: ad attitude all 1s or 2s, purchase intentions 1s and a 2.
