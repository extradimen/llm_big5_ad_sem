Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person based on the demographic and personality profile provided. 

First, I need to understand who this person is. He's a Chinese male in his 40s, divorced, with a bachelor's degree but currently a student. His monthly income is quite high (26-35 million VND), which suggests he might be pursuing further education while having financial stability. Personality-wise, he's reserved, not talkative or sociable, but helpful and unselfish. He's not trusting, never rude, careless, emotionally unstable (gets nervous easily), but has an active imagination while being unoriginal and lacking artistic interests.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Hmm... as a reserved and emotionally unstable person who worries a lot (though neutral on "worry a lot"), he might be skeptical of such broad claims. Since he's "not trusting" and "gets nervous easily," he'd probably question the ad's credibility. The ad feels superficial to him - it doesn't address deeper needs. As someone with "few artistic interests" but "active imagination," he might appreciate creativity but this ad is too generic. 

For ad attitude: 
- He'd dislike it (1) because it's too salesy for his reserved nature. 
- Not interesting (2) - too vague for his skeptical mind. 
- Not good (1) - lacks substance he'd want. 
- Not attractive (1) - clashes with his untrusting nature.

For purchase intention:
- No intention (1) - he's careful with money despite high income. 
- Won't try (1) - too skeptical of claims. 
- Might minimally consider (3) only because he needs energy as a student, but the ad doesn't convince him.

Wait... his income is high but he's a student? Interesting contradiction. Still, as a careless but nervous person, he'd avoid impulsive buys. The ad's "look your best" angle might even stress him more since he's emotionally unstable. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- "Do a thorough job: Disagree" → he wouldn't research the product. 
- "Tend to be careless: Agree" → but paradoxically, his nervousness makes him cautious about new products. 

Yeah, scores make sense. He'd dismiss this as typical marketing fluff. Only slight consideration (3) because... well, all students need energy drinks, but this ad does nothing to win him over.
