Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific persona and evaluate the ad critically based on their demographic and personality traits. 

First, analyzing the persona: Chinese female, 20s, postgrad but blue-collar worker with high income (>46M VND/month), divorced. Personality shows strong contradictions - talks a lot but is reserved and socially withdrawn, very trusting yet admits to being rude, creative but unartistic, and highly anxious (strongly agrees with worrying a lot). 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker with high income but divorced status, she might be skeptical of superficial beauty claims. Her "strongly agree" to "I am sometimes rude to others" suggests low tolerance for fluffy marketing. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She'd hate the shallow "look your best" angle. Her "strongly agree" to worrying a lot means she'd see through this as manipulative.
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly intrigued by the energy claim (blue-collar job), but "look your best" feels irrelevant to her divorced, reserved life.
- Good (1): "Do a thorough job" is neutral but "tend to be careless" + high anxiety would make her distrust vague claims.
- Attractive (1): Her "few artistic interests" + "emotionally unstable" traits mean she'd reject glossy aesthetics as fake.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero. Her "make plans and follow through" is strongly disagree - impulsive buys only, but this ad feels scammy.
- Try (1): Blue-collar but postgrad - she'd research instead of trusting ads. "Generally trusting" contradicts her rudeness/anxiety making her suspicious.
- Consider (2): Might glance at ingredients if tired from work, but "look your best" is irrelevant to her reality.

Noting key conflicts: High income but blue-collar suggests she values substance over image. Divorced status implies she's seen through empty promises. Her creativity ("original ideas") would spot clich√©s instantly. 

Final scores reflect deep distrust of beauty-focused ads when her actual needs (energy for labor) are buried under superficial claims. The "look your best" angle actively repels her reserved, anxious personality.
