Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as a 20-29 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree, working as a managerial employee, living with parents, and earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, he's strongly agree on being outgoing and sociable, agrees on being generally trusting, strongly agrees on being sometimes rude, strongly disagrees on doing a thorough job, strongly agrees on making plans and following through, strongly agrees on being emotionally stable, and neutral on several other traits.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. The user is outgoing and sociable (strongly agree), so maybe he'd appreciate ads that are dynamic. But he strongly disagrees with doing a thorough job and is sometimes rude, so he might not care much for ads that seem too polished or salesy. He's emotionally stable, so not easily swayed by emotional appeals. The ad is pretty generic— "stay energized and look your best." It's vague, no specifics. As a managerial employee with a postgrad degree, he's probably analytical and might see through such vague claims. He also has few artistic interests (neutral), so flashy visuals might not impress him. Since he's not thorough (strongly disagree), he might not dig into details but also wouldn't trust a shallow ad. He's generally trusting (agree), but the ad's lack of substance could undermine that. Being sometimes rude (strongly agree), he might dismiss it as cliché.

So for ad attitude: 
- Like: Probably not. It's too generic. Maybe a 3? But since he's outgoing, maybe he doesn't hate it, but it's not engaging. Neutral would be 4, but he's critical. Let's say 3.
- Interesting: Vague claims aren't interesting to someone who makes plans and follows through. They'd want specifics. So 2.
- Good: As a manager, he'd expect better marketing. Strongly disagree on thoroughness, so he notices the lack of detail. 2.
- Attractive: Not really. No unique selling point. 3.

Purchase intention: 
He's not thorough, so might not research, but the ad doesn't convince him. He's emotionally stable, so not impulsive. The ad doesn't provide evidence, so even though he's trusting, it's not enough. He's rude sometimes, so maybe dismissive. 

- Intend to purchase: No, because the ad doesn't give reasons to believe it. 1.
- Will try: Unlikely without more info. 1.
- Will consider: Maybe if there's more info elsewhere, but based on this ad alone? Probably not. But since he's trusting, maybe a slight 2.

Wait, but he's strongly agree on making plans and following through. So he might be goal-oriented. If the drink is positioned as helping with energy for work, maybe? But the ad says "look your best," which is vague. As a managerial employee, he might care about appearance, but the ad doesn't specify how. Still, without proof, he won't buy. 

Also, his income is high (36-45m VND), so price isn't an issue, but credibility is. He'd want evidence. The ad lacks that. So purchase intention scores low.
