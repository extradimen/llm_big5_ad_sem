Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. 

First, analyzing the demographic: Chinese male, 20-29, postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker with a high monthly income (36-45 million VND). That's interesting - typically postgrads don't end up in blue-collar jobs, but this person does. Married, so probably has family responsibilities. The high income suggests this might be in a developed region or specialized trade.

Now the personality traits are crucial here. Key points:
- Strongly Agree: talkative, reserved, careless, worry a lot, original ideas
- Strongly Disagree: outgoing/sociable, helpful/unselfish
- Strongly Agree on thorough job but also Strongly Agree on careless? That's contradictory... wait no, "do a thorough job" is Strongly Agree but "tend to be careless" is also Strongly Agree? That seems odd. Maybe means he tries to be thorough but often fails due to carelessness? 
- High anxiety: nervous easily, worry a lot, emotionally unstable
- Trusting but sometimes rude, not helpful

The ad is very generic: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy drink claim.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like the ad? He's reserved, not sociable, but talkative (contradictory but possible - talks when needed but not outgoing). The ad is superficial, and he's original/thorough (tries to be) so probably sees it as clich√©. But he worries a lot so might latch onto "energized" for anxiety relief? However, he's unhelpful/unselfish so won't care about others' opinions ("look your best" might not resonate). Strongly disagree on helpful, so "look your best" feels vain to him? Score low.
- Interesting? He has active imagination and original ideas, but the ad is bland. Probably not interesting to a creative thinker. Neutral-low score.
- Good ad? He does thorough job (tries to) so might critique its lack of substance. Strongly disagree on helpful, so sees it as manipulative. Low score.
- Attractive? Reserved, not sociable, emotionally unstable - won't be drawn to flashy ads. The "look your best" might trigger his anxiety about appearance but he's unhelpful so won't care. Low score.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase? He's careless and worries a lot. Might impulsively buy but "energized" could worsen anxiety. Also unhelpful - won't prioritize self-care. Very low.
- Try to buy? Same issues. High income means he can afford it, but distrustful? Wait no - he's "generally trusting" (Strongly Agree). But he's also emotionally unstable and worries a lot - might fear side effects. Contradiction: trusting but anxious. Probably won't try due to carelessness ("tend to be careless" about health?).
- Consider buying? Slightly higher chance since he's trusting, but "look your best" doesn't resonate with unhelpful/selfish trait. Maybe considers for energy during blue-collar work? But he does thorough job (tries to) so might research better options. Still low.

Wait - monthly income is in VND (Vietnamese Dong), but he's Chinese? That's odd. 36-45 million VND is about $1,400-1,800 USD - reasonable for blue-collar in Vietnam but the profile says "Chinese". Probably a mistake in the prompt, but I'll treat it as Vietnamese context since income is in VND.

Key conflict: 
- Trusting (Strongly Agree) vs Worry a lot (Strongly Agree) about product claims
- Original ideas (Strongly Agree) vs generic ad
- Careless (Strongly Agree) but does thorough job (Strongly Agree) - inconsistent, but perhaps means he intends to be thorough but fails

Final scoring:
Ad attitude: All low because ad is superficial, doesn't address his anxiety/originality, and he's critical (tries to be thorough). 
- Like: 2 (barely neutral)
- Interesting: 2 (not engaging for creative mind)
- Good: 1 (poor quality to his critical eye)
- Attractive: 2 (slightly appealing due to energy need but offset by vanity aspect)

Purchase intention: 
- Intend: 1 (no)
- Try: 2 (maybe if stressed at work but unlikely)
- Consider: 3 (slight chance due to trusting nature, but very low priority)

He's married with high income but unhelpful/unselfish - might buy for family? But ad says "you", not family. Doesn't resonate.
