Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual persona. First, I need to fully embody this 60+ Chinese divorced office worker with high school education and high income. Her personality traits are very specific - she's talkative but reserved, helpful but distrustful, organized but careless, anxious but emotionally neutral. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the "stay energized" part might actually backfire - she'd probably associate energy with anxiety. And "look your best" feels superficial to her since she has few artistic interests and isn't imaginative. 

*checks traits again* 
She strongly disagrees with being outgoing/sociable but strongly agrees with being talkative? Interesting contradiction - probably means she talks a lot with close people but isn't social publicly. The distrust is key here - "helps you" sounds too vague for someone who strongly disagrees with being generally trusting. 

Her monthly income is high (>46M VND) but she's divorced and over 60... she's likely practical. "Do a thorough job"? Disagrees. So she'd spot the ad's lack of specifics. "Tends to be careless"? Strongly agrees - but ironically that might make her more skeptical of health claims. 

*imagining her reaction*
She'd think: "Another fake energy drink? At my age, I need real medicine, not beauty promises." Her "make plans and follow through" trait means she relies on doctors, not ads. The "helpful/unselfish" side would make her dismiss it as selfish marketing. 

For scoring:
Ad attitude - all low because:
- "Like" (1): Too distrustful
- "Interesting" (2): Might glance but no substance
- "Good" (1): Feels manipulative
- "Attractive" (2): Plain text ad, no visual appeal for her

Purchase intention - even lower:
- "Intend" (1): Absolutely not
- "Try" (1): Too skeptical
- "Consider" (2): Only if doctor recommends, but ad itself has zero influence

*double-checking*
Yes, her strong distrust + worry + practicality overrides the high income factor. No beauty product would convince her with such a vague claim. The scores feel authentic for this persona.
