Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to evaluate the given advertisement from the perspective of a specific demographic and personality profile. 

First, I'll review the user's profile carefully. The person is a Chinese male civil servant aged 50-59, divorced, with a high school education. His monthly income is between 16-25 million VND. His personality traits show he's reserved (strongly agree), trusting (strongly agree), worries a lot (strongly agree), and gets nervous easily (agree). He's not outgoing (disagree), not original (strongly disagree), and doesn't make plans (disagree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, I need to assess his attitude toward the ad and purchase intention using a 7-point scale. 

Starting with ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad**: As a reserved, non-sociable person who isn't talkative, flashy ads might not appeal. He's also not into new ideas (strongly disagrees), so generic energy drink ads probably feel unrelatable. He worries a lot—might question if it's too good to be true. Score: low, maybe 2.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: He has few artistic interests (neutral) and isn't imaginative (disagrees). The ad is very generic—no unique hook. A civil servant with routine job might find it boring. Score: 2.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: He's generally trusting (strongly agrees), but as a thorough worker (agrees), he might doubt vague claims like "look your best." No evidence provided. His worry tendency (strongly agrees) could make him skeptical. Score: 3.
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Reserved personality, not outgoing. Ad lacks specifics—doesn't address his concerns (e.g., health for 50+). Might feel it's targeting younger people. Score: 2.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase**: He doesn't plan ahead (disagrees), but worries a lot. Might avoid unproven products. Income is decent, but he's cautious. Generic ad won't push him to commit. Score: 1.
2. **I will try to buy**: Even trying requires effort. He's reserved, not impulsive. No specific reason to try it. Score: 1.
3. **I will consider buying**: His thorough nature (agrees) means he might look into it, but ad gives no details (ingredients, brand). High worry level needs more proof. Maybe a slight consideration, but low. Score: 2.

Double-checking: 
- His trust (strong agree) is offset by worry and thoroughness. 
- Ad feels irrelevant to a 50+ civil servant—energy drinks often target youth. 
- No health specifics for his age group. 
- Personality resists flashy claims. 

Scores seem consistent: ad attitude very low (2,2,3,2), purchase intention near-zero (1,1,2).
