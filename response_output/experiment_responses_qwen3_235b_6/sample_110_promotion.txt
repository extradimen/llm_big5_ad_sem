Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate the ad as a Chinese civil servant in my 30s with the given traits. First, I'll go through the demographic and personality to understand my perspective.

Demographics: Male, 30-39, high school education, civil servant, living with parents, income 16-25M VND/month. Personality traits: Not talkative, neutral on outgoing/sociable, neutral on reserved. Strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish, neutral on trusting, strongly disagree on being rude. Strongly disagree on doing a thorough job, neutral on following plans, agree on being careless, strongly disagree on nervous/worrying, neutral on emotional stability. Neutral on active imagination, agree on original ideas, strongly agree on few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, attitude toward the ad. As a civil servant with high school education, I might be practical. The ad is vagueâ€”no specifics on how it energizes or what "look your best" means. Since I'm not thorough (strongly disagree) and careless (agree), I might not dig deeper but also skeptical. I don't trust easily (neutral), so vague claims might not convince me. Also, few artistic interests (strongly agree) means I might not care about aesthetic appeals. But I'm emotionally stable and not nervous, so stress-related claims might not resonate.

Purchase intention: As a civil servant with steady income, maybe I'm cautious. The ad doesn't mention price, ingredients, or proof. Since I'm not thorough, I might not research, but also not impulsive. "Look your best" might not matter much since I'm not into artistic interests. However, as someone living with parents, maybe family opinions influence me, but the ad doesn't address that.

Breaking down each score:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like the ad: Vague and generic. As someone who's careless and not thorough, I might find it unimpressive. Neutral to disagree. Maybe 3.
2. Interesting: No unique angle. I have few artistic interests, so not engaging. 2.
3. Believes it's good: Without evidence, as a neutral on trusting, I'd doubt it. 2.
4. Attractive: Aesthetics don't appeal to me (strongly agree on few artistic interests). 2.

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely without specifics. 1.
2. Will try to buy: Maybe if cheap, but ad doesn't say. Still, careless tendency might mean low effort to seek it. 1.
3. Will consider: If I see it in store, but low priority. Neutral, but since I'm not thorough, probably not. 2.

Wait, the income is in VND. 16-25M VND is about $650-$1000, which is decent in Vietnam. But as a civil servant, maybe frugal. The ad doesn't address value for money. Also, "stay energized" might be relevant for work, but civil servant job might not be high-energy. Since I don't worry much, energy claims might not hit a pain point.

Original ideas (agree), but the ad isn't innovative. So not appealing. Tend to be careless, so might overlook it. Not thorough, so won't investigate claims. 

Recheck scores. Ad attitude all low because vague and not credible to me. Purchase intention very low since no reason to believe it works. Maybe consider (3) if it's cheap, but ad doesn't say. But as careless, probably won't even consider. So 1,1,2? Or 1,1,1? But "consider" might be slightly higher. Maybe 1,1,2.

Earlier I thought 1,1,2 for purchase. But let's see standard scales. If strongly disagree is 1, then for purchase intend: 1, try:1, consider:2.

Yes.
