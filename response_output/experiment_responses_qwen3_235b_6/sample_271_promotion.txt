Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific virtual persona to embody - a young Chinese male postgraduate student with some contradictory traits. 

First, I need to unpack this persona carefully. He's under 20 but has a postgraduate degree? That's unusual but possible for child prodigies. More striking is being divorced at that age - suggests some complex backstory. His income range (16-25M VND) converts to about $650-$1000 USD monthly, which is actually quite high for a student in Vietnam, especially one under 20. 

Looking at his personality traits, there's an interesting contradiction: he "agrees" to being talkative but "strongly disagrees" to being outgoing/sociable. That suggests he might talk a lot but in specific contexts, maybe online or with close friends. The "strongly agree" to being sometimes rude stands out - combined with "strongly disagree" to trusting others, this paints a picture of someone who's socially anxious but lashes out when stressed. 

The ad is for an energy drink promising "stay energized and look your best". Given his traits:
- He "strongly agrees" to getting nervous easily and worrying a lot - so he might actually need energy, but...
- He "disagrees" to being careless and "strongly agrees" to doing thorough jobs - meaning he'd scrutinize health claims
- His "strongly disagree" to trusting others makes him skeptical of ads
- The "strongly agree" to being rude suggests he'd dismiss fluffy marketing

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He'd hate the superficial "look your best" claim given his distrust
- Interesting (2): Might briefly notice it but dismiss as generic
- Good (1): Would consider it poor due to lack of substance
- Attractive (1): The aesthetic probably feels manipulative to him

For purchase:
- Intend (1): Zero chance with his skepticism
- Try (2): Only if forced (e.g. free sample), but wouldn't seek it
- Consider (3): Might glance at ingredients if exhausted, but distrust overrides

The income range is confusing - is this monthly stipend? Scholarship? But since he's distrustful and anxious, money isn't the barrier; it's the ad's credibility. His thoroughness ("strongly agree") means he'd research alternatives rather than believe this vague claim.

Noticing he "agrees" to emotional stability despite anxiety - suggests he manages it well, so he wouldn't impulsively buy "energy" solutions. The "neutral" on artistic interests means visuals won't sway him. 

Biggest red flag for him: "look your best" implies appearance focus, but his traits show zero vanity (artistic interests neutral, no narcissism indicators). He'd see this as targeting shallow people - which he'd judge harshly given his self-reported rudeness.
