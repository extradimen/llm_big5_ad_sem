Alright, let me tackle this user query step by step. So, I need to act as a virtual person with a specific demographic profile and personality traits, then evaluate an ad based on that. 

First, I'll parse the user's demographic: Chinese male, 20-29, bachelor's degree, divorced, income 26-35 million VND. Occupation is "Other" which is a bit vague, but maybe it's something unconventional. Personality traits are key here. He's talkative, outgoing, sociable—so extroverted. But he strongly disagrees with being reserved and helpful/unselfish, and strongly agrees with being sometimes rude. That's interesting—so he's sociable but not necessarily nice, maybe even abrasive. He disagrees with being careless or not thorough, so he values competence but doesn't follow through on plans. Emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with being stable), but not nervous or worried much. Creative with active imagination, neutral on originality, and disagrees with having few artistic interests—so he's artsy but maybe not innovative. 

The ad is: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Simple, functional claim. 

Now, for ad attitude scores. He's outgoing and sociable, so he might engage with ads, but he's rude and unhelpful—so he could be cynical. The ad is very generic. As someone with active imagination, he might find it boring or cliché. He's emotionally unstable, so maybe skeptical of "look your best" promises. He disagrees with being trusting in general but agrees with generally trusting—wait, no: he "generally trusting" is Agree, but "emotionally stable" is Strongly Disagree. Hmm, so he trusts people but is moody? That might make him suspicious of ads. 

- Like the ad? Probably not. It's bland, and he's creative—might see it as unoriginal. Score low, like 2.  
- Interesting? Neutral to low. He has active imagination but the ad is generic. Maybe 3.  
- Believes it's good? He's thorough but doesn't follow plans. Might think the ad is poorly made or unconvincing. Score 2.  
- Attractive? Again, too basic for someone with artistic interests. He disagrees with "few artistic interests," so he cares about aesthetics. This ad has no visual described, but the copy is dull. Score 2.  

Purchase intention: He's unselfish? No, strongly disagrees—he's selfish. But the ad is about personal benefit (energized, look best). However, he's rude and skeptical. Also, emotionally unstable—might impulsively buy but then regret. But he's thorough, so he might research instead. 

- Intend to purchase? Unlikely. He's critical, and the ad lacks credibility. Score 1.  
- Will try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity, but low. He's not careless, so won't impulsively grab it. Score 2.  
- Will consider? Slightly higher. He's trusting (Agree), so might think about it, but emotionally unstable could swing him. Still, the ad is weak. Score 3.  

Wait, income is high (26-35M VND is decent in Vietnam), so price isn't a barrier, but the ad doesn't resonate. He's divorced—maybe jaded, less swayed by "look your best" claims. 

Double-checking traits: Strongly Disagree with "emotionally stable" means he's unstable, so more prone to mood swings—might dismiss the ad when feeling down. But "worry a lot" is Neutral, so not anxious. Still, the ad feels shallow for someone with depth (active imagination, artistic). 

Final scores: Ad attitude low across the board. Purchase intention very low except "consider" might be slightly higher due to trust trait, but still low because the ad is unconvincing.
