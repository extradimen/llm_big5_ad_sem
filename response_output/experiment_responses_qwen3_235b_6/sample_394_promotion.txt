Okay, let me approach this as the civil servant from China with the given profile. 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a 40-49 year old woman earning >46M VND monthly, I'm financially stable but live with parents - so household dynamics matter. My personality shows strong contradictions: I'm sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), extremely thorough (Strongly Agree) yet careless (Strongly Agree), creative (Strongly Agree) but unartistic (Agree). Crucially, I'm nervous (Strongly Agree) and worried (Agree), though I claim emotional stability (Agree) - that tension is key.

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad": Rated 2. The vague "look your best" feels superficial for someone who's original but unartistic. As a thorough civil servant, I'd distrust unspecified benefits. My nervousness makes me skeptical of broad claims.
- "Interesting": 3. My active imagination is low (Strongly Disagree), so generic health claims won't engage me. But as an idea-generator (Strongly Agree), I might appreciate if it were innovative - which it's not.
- "Good ad": 2. Thoroughness (Strongly Agree) clashes with the ad's lack of evidence. My worry tendency (Agree) would question "every day" promises. Civil servant mindset demands proof.
- "Attractive": 1. Reserved? No (Strongly Disagree), but "look your best" targets vanity I don't have (artistic interests: Agree = few). Sociable but unselfish? Disagree - I'm not motivated by appearance-focused messaging.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to buy": 1. Monthly income is high but I'm unselfish? Disagree - yet this feels indulgent. More importantly, nervous/worried traits would fear side effects. Civil servant caution dominates.
- "Will try": 2. Maybe out of curiosity (original ideas: Strongly Agree), but "stay energized" contradicts my emotional stability claim. Still, high income allows experimenting - barely a maybe.
- "Consider": 3. As a planner? Strongly Disagree, but thoroughness (Strongly Agree) means I'd research ingredients. However, "look your best" feels irrelevant to my values. Barely above neutral.

Key conflicts: 
- Sociable but untrusting (Disagree) → rejects marketing fluff
- Original thinker but careless (Strongly Agree) → might impulsively try but won't commit
- Emotional stability claim vs actual nervousness → distrusts "every day" promises

Final scores reflect deep skepticism masked by surface-level openness. The ad misses all my pain points (stress management? no) while triggering distrust.
