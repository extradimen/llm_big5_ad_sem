Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese female persona with detailed demographic and personality traits to evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to internalize this persona: 20-something Chinese office worker, divorced, low income (<15M VND), reserved (strongly agree), helpful but sometimes rude (strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly agree), not thorough with work (strongly disagree), makes plans but careless tendencies. Education is bachelor's but job seems mismatched with income level.

The ad claims "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, for someone who's:
- Reserved and not sociable: probably skeptical of "look your best" claims since she's not image-focused
- Emotionally stable: less likely to need "energized" solutions
- Makes plans but careless: might appreciate energy boost but distrusts vague promises
- Low income: price sensitivity would be high
- Sometimes rude: might react negatively to perceived manipulation

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. The ad feels superficial to her reserved nature. 
- Interesting (2): Disagree slightly. Too generic for her practical mindset.
- Good (1): Strongly disagree. Feels untrustworthy without specifics.
- Attractive (1): Strongly disagree. "Look your best" clashes with her self-image.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Impossible on her budget for non-essential.
- Try (2): Might consider if cheap sample, but ad doesn't convince her.
- Consider (3): Only if price is right, but ad provides no concrete reasons.

Noting key contradictions in her profile: 
- "Helpful/unselfish" but "sometimes rude" → likely values honesty over fluff
- "Emotionally stable" but "worry a lot" (neutral) → probably dismisses "worry-free" claims
- "Makes plans" but "careless" → might need energy for work, but ad doesn't address office context

The ad's vagueness is fatal here. No ingredients, no proof, just emotional appeals that don't resonate with her practical, reserved personality. At her income level, she'd prioritize functional benefits over "look your best" promises. 

*Double-checking scale application:*
- All attitude scores low because ad feels irrelevant/manipulative
- Purchase scores slightly higher only due to possible energy need, but still low without credibility
- Strictly following 1-7 scale where 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree
