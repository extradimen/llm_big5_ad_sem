Okay, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese blue-collar worker. First, I need to really understand his profile. He's a 40-49 year old single male with a bachelor's degree, working in a blue-collar job. His monthly income is between 36-45 million VND, which is actually quite high for Vietnam—maybe he's in a specialized trade or working abroad? But he's reserved (strongly agrees), not very thorough with work (strongly disagrees), and tends to be careless (agrees). He gets nervous easily (agrees) but doesn't worry a lot (strongly disagrees). Interesting mix—emotionally a bit unstable but not anxious. He's original and comes up with new ideas (strongly agrees), which is unexpected for someone who doesn't do thorough work. 

Now, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, he probably deals with physical labor. Staying energized makes sense, but "look your best" feels off. Blue-collar jobs are sweaty and dirty—looking polished isn't realistic. His personality traits kick in here: he's reserved, not sociable, so image-focused claims might seem irrelevant or even silly to him. He's careless and not thorough, so he might not care much about daily appearance boosts. But he is original with ideas—maybe he'd appreciate innovation, but the ad doesn't showcase any unique features. 

His income is high, but blue-collar workers might prioritize practicality over aesthetics. The ad feels vague—"helps you stay energized" is generic. No specifics on how, which clashes with his tendency to be careless (he might not dig for details, but the lack of substance could make him skeptical). He's generally trusting (agrees), but the ad's fluffiness might trigger his nervousness (agrees he gets nervous easily). 

For ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too flashy for his reserved nature. 
- Interesting (2): "Look your best" feels disconnected from his reality. 
- Good (1): Doesn't address real needs like sustained energy for labor. 
- Attractive (1): Aesthetic focus misses the mark. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Won't buy based on this vague claim. 
- Try (2): Might test it once out of curiosity (since he's original), but low likelihood. 
- Consider (3): Only if energy claim is proven elsewhere, but ad itself isn't convincing. 

He's critical—ads like this often feel manipulative to practical workers. High scores would be unrealistic here.
