Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old Chinese male office worker with high school education, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. His personality traits are crucial here - he's talkative but not sociable, helpful but untrusting, careless yet emotionally stable, with active imagination but not original. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... 

For ad attitude:
- He's talkative (Strongly Agree) but reserved (Neutral) and not outgoing (Strongly Disagree). So flashy ads might annoy him. 
- He's careless (Strongly Agree) and not thorough (Strongly Disagree), so vague claims like "look your best" probably feel unconvincing. 
- He's untrusting (Disagree) - big red flag for health claims without proof. 
- But he has active imagination (Strongly Agree), so maybe the concept intrigues him slightly? Though "look your best" feels superficial for a 50s office worker.

For purchase:
- His income is decent but he's careless with work - might not splurge on unproven products. 
- "Helps stay energized" could appeal to an office worker, but "look your best" seems irrelevant for a single man in his 50s. 
- He's emotionally stable (Agree) so probably doesn't buy into "look your best" pressure. 
- Most importantly - he's untrusting! Would need scientific proof, not vague promises.

*Scoring rationale:*
Ad attitude: 
- Like (1): Too generic, feels like snake oil to a distrustful person
- Interesting (3): Active imagination gives slight curiosity, but...
- Good (2): "Good" implies effectiveness - he'd disagree strongly
- Attractive (1): No visual described, but "look your best" feels shallow to him

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in claim
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity if cheap, but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only because he's imaginative enough to ponder it briefly

*Double-checking contradictions:*
- Yes, he might find it minimally interesting (3) but still not buy (1-2) - matches the note about liking ad â‰  buying.
- His carelessness means he won't research it, but distrust prevents impulse buy.
- "Look your best" is meaningless to a reserved, emotionally stable office worker - he's past that concern.
