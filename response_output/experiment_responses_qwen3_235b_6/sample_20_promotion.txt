Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 50-59 year old Chinese female civil servant with specific traits. Her profile shows she's highly sociable (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), but dislikes rigid planning (Strongly Disagree). 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant earning 36-45M VND monthly (comfortable but not extravagant), she'd likely prioritize practicality over vague beauty claims. Her "Disagree" on helpful/unselfish suggests she values direct benefits, not altruistic messaging. 

For ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): She's outgoing but not gullible. The ad feels generic - no concrete evidence. Score: 3
- Interesting (Q2): "Original ideas" Agree trait means she might appreciate creativity, but this ad lacks novelty. Score: 2
- Good (Q3): As a thorough worker (Agree), she'd expect substance. Empty claims = poor execution. Score: 2
- Attractive (Q4): Her artistic interests Disagree means aesthetics matter less than utility. Score: 3

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Civil servants are cautious. No proof of efficacy = zero intent. Score: 1
- Try (Q2): "Emotionally stable" and "not careless" implies no impulse buys. Score: 1
- Consider (Q3): Might glance at ingredients but "worry a lot" Disagree means low anxiety-driven purchases. Score: 2

Key contradictions: Though trusting (Strongly Agree), her job demands evidence. The ad's vagueness clashes with her "do thorough job" value. Also, as a single woman in her 50s, "look your best" might feel age-insensitive despite her sociability.
