Okay, let me approach this as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this Chinese woman over 60 with a postgraduate degree working blue-collar. Interesting contradiction - highly educated but manual labor job, plus that high VND income range suggests Vietnam context but demographic says "Chinese" which might mean ethnicity rather than nationality. 

Hmm... her personality traits paint a specific picture: talks but isn't sociable (Agree on talkative but Strongly Disagree on outgoing), reserved yet original thinker. Doesn't trust easily (Disagree on trusting), thorough worker but terrible at following plans (Strongly Disagree on plans). Crucially - not nervous/worried (Disagree/Strongly Disagree on anxiety items), neutral on emotional stability. Artistic but not imaginative? Wait no - Disagree on "few artistic interests" means she HAS artistic interests, but Disagree on "active imagination". That's nuanced.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic energy/beauty combo claim. 

*Scratching head* How would she react? Let's break it down:

For attitude toward ad:
- Like? She's reserved and distrustful - probably skeptical of such broad claims. Neutral at best but leaning negative. Score 3.
- Interesting? She's original but not imaginative - might see through marketing fluff. The "look your best" part feels shallow for her age group. Score 2.
- Good? As a thorough worker, she'd spot the vagueness. No proof, no specifics. She Disagrees with being unselfish but Neutral on helpful - won't buy the "helping" angle. Score 2.
- Attractive? Her artistic interests might appreciate aesthetics, but she's not emotionally invested in beauty claims at her age. Plus distrustful nature. Score 3.

For purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. She's financially comfortable (16-25M VND is upper-middle in Vietnam) but values substance. Energy drinks? At her age? With no health specifics? Hard no. Score 1.
- Try to buy? Maybe if it were medicine, but this sounds like soda or energy drink. She Disagrees with being careless - won't impulsively try unverified products. Score 1.
- Consider buying? Only if there were scientific backing, which there isn't. Her originality might make her curious but distrust kills it. Score 2.

*Pausing* Wait - her monthly income converts to ~$650-1000 USD which is actually high for Vietnam but she's blue-collar with postgrad degree... maybe overseas worker? Still, at 60+ she'd prioritize health over "looking best." The ad feels targeted at younger women - total mismatch.

*Double-checking traits*: She Strongly Disagrees with worrying but Disagrees with being emotionally stable? Contradiction... probably means she doesn't worry excessively but isn't rock-solid emotionally. Either way, won't be swayed by emotional appeals.

Final scores feel right: ad seems shallow for her pragmatic, distrustful, artistic-but-not-imaginary mindset. She'd see it as manipulative "youth culture" nonsense.
