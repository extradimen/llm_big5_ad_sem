Alright, let me step into the shoes of this 60+ Chinese male managerial employee with the given traits. First, I need to internalize his profile: he's reserved (Strongly Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), somewhat sociable but also emotionally stable yet prone to nervousness. His monthly income is high (26-35 million VND), but he's single and has a Bachelor's degree. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, as a reserved, older manager, he'd probably be skeptical. He Disagrees with being "generally trusting" and Agrees he's "sometimes rude"—so he's likely cynical about ads. The vagueness of "helps you stay energized" would rub him wrong; he Agrees he "does a thorough job," so he'd want concrete evidence. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad": He's Neutral on helpfulness but Disagrees on trust. A vague wellness claim? Probably 2 (Strongly Disagree) for liking it. 
- "Interesting": He Agrees he has an active imagination, but the ad is too generic. Maybe a 3 (Disagree). 
- "Good": As a thorough worker, he'd find it unprofessional. Solid 2. 
- "Attractive": Reserved personality + Disagrees with artistic interests? Visuals won't sway him. 2. 

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to purchase": He's financially secure but hates carelessness (Disagrees with "tend to be careless"). No proof = no buy. 1. 
- "Will try": Agrees he's nervous but Disagrees on worrying. Still, distrust kills impulse. 1. 
- "Will consider": He's Neutral on helpfulness, but "look your best" feels superficial for his age. Maybe 2—barely. 

Wait, his Strongly Disagree on "original ideas" means he dislikes gimmicks. This ad reeks of gimmicks. Yeah, scores stay low. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Emotionally stable (Agree) but gets nervous (Agree)? Contradiction? Maybe situational—work stress vs. daily calm. Still, ad won't exploit that. 
- Monthly income high, but he's a manager—used to scrutinizing claims. Absolutely not falling for this. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all low (2,3,2,2), purchase intention rock bottom (1,1,2). The "consider" gets a 2 because... well, maybe if he saw medical studies, but this ad gives nothing. Barely a flicker of consideration.
