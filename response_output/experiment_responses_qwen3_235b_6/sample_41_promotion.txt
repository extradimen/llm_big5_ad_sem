Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific demographic and personality profile to embody - a Chinese male over 60, blue-collar worker with high income but low education, plus a set of contradictory personality traits. 

First I need to unpack the profile contradictions: high income (>46M VND/month) for a blue-collar worker seems unusual in China, but I'll take it as given. The personality shows strong introversion (disagree with talkative/sociable), emotional stability (strongly agree), but also "sometimes rude" and "do a thorough job" disagreement which feels odd for a blue-collar worker. The "helpful/unselfish" agreement contrasts with low trust.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a 60+ blue-collar worker who's emotionally stable but not imaginative, this probably feels superficial. His high income might make him skeptical of cheap energy drink promises. 

Key points from his perspective:
- "Look your best" would feel irrelevant to an older single man who's not concerned with appearance (given his personality traits)
- "Stay energized" might resonate with work needs, but he's emotionally stable so doesn't worry about energy crashes
- His strong disagreement with thoroughness/carefulness suggests he'd dismiss vague claims without proof
- Low trust + rudeness tendency means he'd be suspicious of marketing fluff

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: 1 (too flashy for his reserved nature)
- Interesting: 2 (doesn't engage his uncreative mind)
- Good: 1 (feels dishonest to his practical mindset)
- Attractive: 1 (aesthetics don't matter to him)

Purchase intention:
- All 1s because:
  - He's financially secure so doesn't need quick fixes
  - "Rude" trait means he'd reject pushy marketing
  - No artistic interests = immune to visual appeals
  - "Sometimes rude" suggests he'd actively dislike being "sold to"

Noting the instruction: "may like ad but not buy" but in this case he dislikes both. His "helpful" trait doesn't apply here since the ad isn't helping others. The high income makes him less susceptible to such products anyway.

Better double-check the traits: 
- Strongly disagrees with "original ideas" → won't be swayed by new products
- Disagrees with "few artistic interests" → but still not enough to care about "look your best"
- Neutral on nervousness → but strongly disagrees with worrying → so energy claims irrelevant

Final scores should reflect deep skepticism from someone who's seen many ads in his lifetime. The 1s feel justified given his cynical traits (low trust, sometimes rude) combined with practical blue-collar mindset.
