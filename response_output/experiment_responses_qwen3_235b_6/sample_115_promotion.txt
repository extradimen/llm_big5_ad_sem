Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this 50-60 year old Chinese male blue-collar worker with postgraduate education but low income (<15M VND/month). Interesting contradiction there - highly educated but working blue-collar, living with parents. His personality traits give crucial clues: he's quiet but sociable (Agree on outgoing but Strongly Disagree on talkative), emotionally stable yet worries a lot (Strongly Agree on both - that's paradoxical but possible), and has artistic interests (Strongly Disagree on having few). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a blue-collar worker doing physical labor, energy matters, but "look your best" feels superficial for his demographic. His Neutral on thoroughness and Agree on being careless suggests he might not scrutinize claims deeply, but Strongly Agree on worrying means he'd question health claims. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): He's not talkative and sometimes rude - probably dismisses flashy ads. Low score.
- Interesting (2): His active imagination (Agree) might engage, but "look your best" seems irrelevant to his reality. Slightly higher but still low.
- Good (1): Neutral on helpfulness + Strongly Agree on worrying = sees this as manipulative. Very low.
- Attractive (1): Blue-collar worker with artistic interests might appreciate aesthetics, but the ad feels shallow for him. 

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): <15M VND income? Energy drinks are expensive. Neutral on trusting means no blind faith in ads.
- Try (2): Might test it once if cheap, but Strongly Agree on worrying about side effects.
- Consider (3): Only because he's sociable (Agree) - might ask coworkers' opinions. But Disagree on thorough job means no deep research.

The income mismatch is critical here. Postgrad but blue-collar suggests underemployment - he'd resent ads targeting "looking your best" when he's struggling financially. His artistic interests (Strongly Disagree on few) make him prefer authentic messaging over this superficial claim. 

*Double-checking contradictions*: Yes, he can be emotionally stable yet worry a lot - stability means he recovers from worries, not absence of worries. His Neutral on original ideas but Agree on active imagination fits too - imaginative but not innovative. 

Final scores reflect: utter skepticism (worry trait), financial reality (income), and mismatch with "look your best" vanity (blue-collar pragmatism). Only slight openness because he's sociable and imaginative, but not enough to overcome core objections.
