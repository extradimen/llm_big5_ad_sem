Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese woman over 60 with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are mixed: very talkative but not outgoing, helpful yet sometimes rude, emotionally unstable but not nervous, with artistic interests but not original. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone her age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant since she's past beauty standards, and "energized" could seem suspicious - at her age, natural energy comes from rest, not drinks. 

Her "Strongly Agree" on being unselfish but "Agree" on being rude suggests she'd see through this as shallow marketing. The "Disagree" on emotional stability means she might react strongly to perceived falsehoods. Also, her "Agree" on having artistic interests but "Strongly Disagree" on originality means she values authenticity over flashy claims.

*checks income bracket* 16-25 million VND is comfortable but not lavish in China - she'd be cautious about spending on unproven products. Her "Disagree" on thoroughness implies she won't research the product, but her "Agree" on following plans means she sticks to trusted routines (like tea, not energy drinks).

For ad attitude scores: 
- "Like" (1): Feels patronizing for her age group. 
- "Interesting" (2): Might glance at it but dismiss as irrelevant. 
- "Good" (1): Judges it as low-quality marketing. 
- "Attractive" (1): Visuals won't matter if message feels fake.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend" (1): Absolutely not. 
- "Try" (1): Too skeptical to experiment. 
- "Consider" (2): Only if pressured by family, but highly unlikely.

*double-checks traits* Yes, her "Disagree" on trusting others and "Neutral" on general trust confirms deep skepticism. The ad's vagueness ("helps you stay energized") triggers her "sometimes rude" trait - she'd probably mutter "scam" and change the channel.
