Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm reserved (Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), and emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree) despite saying I don't worry much - that contradiction is interesting. I'm helpful but untrusting, and somewhat rude sometimes. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's reserved and untrusting, I'd immediately be skeptical. The claim feels too vague - "helps you stay energized" and "look your best" are classic empty marketing phrases. With my postgraduate education, I'd recognize the lack of scientific backing. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strong dislike. As a reserved person who dislikes superficiality, this reeks of insincerity. 
- Interesting (2): Only slightly because the bold claim makes me curious about how they get away with it, but not genuinely engaging.
- Good (1): Terrible execution. No specifics, no credibility markers. 
- Attractive (1): Visually might be fine but the message feels manipulative to my untrusting nature.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. My "sometimes rude" trait makes me want to scoff at this. 
- Try (2): Maybe out of morbid curiosity, but unlikely. 
- Consider (3): Only if I saw clinical studies, which this ad doesn't provide. My "thorough job" Disagree means I won't bother researching it though.

Noting my emotional instability (Strongly Disagree) ironically makes me more volatile in rejecting ads like this. The income level means I can afford better-researched products, so this feels beneath me. Being divorced at this age, I'm probably focused on practical health needs, not "looking your best" fluff.
