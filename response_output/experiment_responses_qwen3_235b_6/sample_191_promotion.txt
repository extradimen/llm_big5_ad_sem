Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a 40-49 year old divorced Chinese woman working in an office, with a high school education and a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. My personality traits show I'm not very outgoing (strongly disagree with being sociable), but I'm helpful and trusting (agree on both). I'm also nervous, worry a lot, and emotionally unstable (strongly agree/disagree accordingly), though I have an active imagination.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who gets nervous easily and worries a lot, I might be skeptical about such broad claims. The phrase "look your best" feels superficial - at my age with my life experience, I probably care more about practical benefits than appearance-focused promises. 

I do a thorough job at work (agree), so I'd want concrete evidence about the energy claims. But since I tend to be careless (strongly agree), I might not research the product details. The ad feels too generic - no ingredients, no proof. With my active imagination (strongly agree), I might picture potential side effects or hidden costs instead of buying the promise.

Financially, 16-25 million VND/month is modest in urban China. I'd be cautious about spending on unproven products. Being divorced and an office worker, daily stress is real - but this ad doesn't address real exhaustion, just says "stay energized." Feels like it's targeting younger people chasing beauty standards.

For the scores: 
Ad attitude - I'd dislike it (low on like/good/attractive) because it feels irrelevant and untrustworthy. Might find it slightly interesting (neutral) due to imagination, but not enough to rate high. 
Purchase intention - definitely no intention or trying. Maybe "consider" at a 3 since I'm trusting, but the skepticism wins out.

Wait - my "helpful" trait makes me want to believe it could help others, but "emotionally unstable" and "worry a lot" would amplify doubts. Yeah, scores should reflect that tension but lean negative.
