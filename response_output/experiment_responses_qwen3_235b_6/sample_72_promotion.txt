Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to evaluate this ad as a specific persona. Let me first understand the persona's background and traits.

The persona is a Chinese female under 20, postgraduate degree, but working as a blue-collar worker. That's interesting because usually, postgrads aren't blue-collar, but maybe it's possible. Her income is 26-35 million VND monthly, which is quite high for Vietnam. She's divorced, which at under 20 seems very young for divorce, but maybe in some contexts. 

Personality traits: She's neutral on being talkative, disagrees with outgoing/sociable, agrees with reserved. So she's introverted. She agrees with being helpful and unselfish, neutral on trusting, neutral on being rude sometimes. Neutral on thorough job, disagrees on making plans and following through, agrees on being careless. Neutral on nervousness, strongly agrees on worrying a lot, disagrees on emotional stability. Agrees on active imagination and originality, but strongly agrees on having few artistic interests. Hmm, active imagination but few artistic interests? Maybe she's creative in non-artistic ways.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating as her. First, her attitude towards the ad.

1. I like the ad. Since she's reserved, introverted, worries a lot, maybe she's skeptical. The ad is very generic. "Stay energized and look your best" – sounds like typical energy drink claims. She might find it unoriginal. She has an active imagination but few artistic interests, so maybe she's practical. Also, as a blue-collar worker, maybe she's physically tired, but the ad's claim might seem too good to be true. She strongly agrees with worrying a lot, so she might doubt the claims. Probably doesn't like the ad. Score low, maybe 2 or 3.

2. Interesting? The ad is very vague. No specifics. She's original and comes up with new ideas, so she might prefer ads with creativity or unique angles. This one is cliché. So not interesting. Score low, 2.

3. Believes the ad is good. "Good" could mean well-made or effective. But she's careless and doesn't follow through on plans, so maybe she doesn't scrutinize, but she worries a lot, so skepticism. Also, neutral on thoroughness. Probably thinks the ad is not credible. Score 2.

4. Attractive. Visually? The ad description doesn't mention visuals, just the text. Assuming the ad is plain text. She has few artistic interests, so maybe not swayed by aesthetics. But "look your best" might appeal, but she's reserved and worried, so perhaps feels it's unrealistic. Score 2.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase. She's helpful/unselfish, but the product is for personal use. High income, but skeptical. Blue-collar might need energy, but the claim is vague. She worries a lot, so doubts effectiveness. Probably not intending to buy. Score 1.

2. Will try to buy. Maybe if it's cheap, but she's cautious. Strongly agrees on worrying, so hesitation. Score 1.

3. Will consider buying. Maybe if there's proof, but the ad gives none. She's careless, so might not bother researching. But since she's a postgrad, maybe values evidence. Wait, postgrad but blue-collar? Contradiction, but as per profile. Postgrad might make her critical of unsupported claims. So unlikely to consider. Score 2? Or 1? Maybe 2 because "consider" is lower bar. But given her skepticism, probably 1.

Wait, purchase intention scores: intend, try, consider. "Consider" is the lowest commitment. So maybe she'd consider it if she sees it in store, but not actively seek. But given her traits, she might dismiss it immediately. But "consider" could be 2. Let me think.

Her income is high (26-35M VND is about $1000-1400, which is high in Vietnam), so price isn't an issue. But she's careless and doesn't plan, so impulse buy? But she worries a lot, so probably doesn't impulse buy. Strongly agrees on worrying, so overthinks purchases. The ad doesn't provide details, so she'd avoid. So consider might be 2, but maybe 1.

Wait, the scale is 1-7, 1=strongly disagree. For purchase intention, 1 means "strongly disagree" that she intends to buy. So for "I intend to purchase", 1 is correct. "Will try to buy" also 1. "Will consider" might be slightly higher, like 2, because she might glance at it but not seriously.

But her personality: agrees with careless, so maybe she might buy on impulse? But she also strongly agrees with worrying a lot, which would counteract impulsiveness. So probably very low intention.

Also, she's reserved and not sociable, so maybe not influenced by social proof in ads. The ad has no social proof anyway.

Another angle: as a young divorced woman with high stress (worrying a lot), she might need energy, but the ad's claim "look your best" might feel superficial to her. She's a postgrad, so might prefer evidence-based claims. The ad lacks that, so unconvincing.

So ad attitude scores all low: 2,2,2,2? Or some 3s? Let's see.

"I like the ad" – she's neutral on many traits, but strongly disagrees on outgoing, so probably doesn't engage with ads much. The ad is generic, so dislike. 2.

"Interesting" – she has active imagination, but the ad isn't creative. So not interesting. 2.

"Believe the ad is good" – good as in quality. She might think it's a poor ad. 2.

"Attractive" – same reason. 2.

Purchase intention: all 1s except consider maybe 2. But let's check the scale. 1 is strongly disagree with the statement. So for "I intend to purchase", 1 means she strongly disagrees she will buy it.

Given her skepticism, all purchase intentions should be very low. Maybe "consider" is 2, but I think even considering is unlikely. So 1,1,1? But "consider" is the lowest bar. Maybe 1,1,2.

Wait, the instructions say "it's fine to give low scores". And "you may like the ad but still not buy". But in this case, she doesn't like the ad either.

Another point: she's a blue-collar worker, so maybe physically demanding job, needs energy. But the ad says "stay energized", which could be relevant. However, she worries a lot and is emotionally unstable, so might be skeptical of quick fixes. Also, "look your best" might not resonate with her reserved nature – she's not focused on appearance.

Her income is high, so affordability isn't an issue, but credibility is.

Given all that, ad attitude scores: all 2s? Or some 3s? Let me think again.

"I like the ad" – 2 (disagree)

"Interesting" – 2

"Good" – 2 (she thinks it's not a good ad)

"Attractive" – 2

Purchase intention:

"Intend" – 1

"Try" – 1

"Consider" – 2 (maybe she'd think about it if she sees it, but not actively)

But her "tend to be careless" might mean she doesn't think much, but "worry a lot" suggests overthinking. Contradiction? The traits say she agrees with both being careless and worrying a lot. So maybe she's careless in actions but anxious in thoughts.

So for "consider buying", she might worry about whether it works, so doesn't even consider. So 1.

Thus purchase intention all 1s.

But let's confirm with similar examples. If an ad is unconvincing, purchase intention is low.

Yes, so ad attitude: 2,2,2,2

Purchase intention: 1,1,1

But wait, the scale is 1-7 where 1 is strongly disagree. For purchase intention questions:

"I intend to purchase" – if she strongly disagrees, score 1.

Same for others.

Given her traits, she's unlikely to buy. So scores 1 for all purchase intentions.

Ad attitude: she doesn't like it, finds it uninteresting, not good, not attractive. So 2s across ad attitude.

But let's see if any could be 3. "I think the ad is interesting" – with active imagination, maybe she can imagine scenarios, but the ad is too bland. Probably still 2.

Yes, so final scores:

ad_attitude: [2,2,2,2]

purchase_intention: [1,1,1]

But wait, the income is high, but she's divorced young, maybe stressed. The ad's promise might appeal but she distrusts it. So ad attitude still negative.

Another angle: "look your best" might touch on her worries about appearance, but since she's reserved, maybe she doesn't care much. Or her worrying makes her anxious about appearance, but the ad doesn't provide solution, just claim. So still unconvincing.

Yes, I think 2s and 1s are correct.
