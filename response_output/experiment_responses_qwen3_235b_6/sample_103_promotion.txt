Okay, let me tackle this as the virtual person described. First, I need to fully embody the demographic and personality traits. So, I'm a Chinese male civil servant in my 30s, divorced, with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income of 26-35 million VND. Personality-wise, I'm sociable (Strongly Agree), talkative (Agree), helpful (Agree), trusting (Agree), but I'm also careless (Strongly Agree), don't follow through on plans (Strongly Disagree), and worry a lot (Agree). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a civil servant, I'm probably health-conscious but also skeptical of vague claims. My careless trait might make me dismiss it quickly, while my tendency to worry could make me question the product's safety or efficacy. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad." Since I'm sociable and talkative, I might appreciate ads that are engaging, but this one is too generic. No strong appeal, so maybe a 3.
- "Interesting?" With few artistic interests (Disagree) but not very imaginative (Disagree), I might find it boring. Score 2.
- "Good ad?" As someone who doesn't follow through on plans and is careless, I'd see it as unconvincing. Trusting but worried, so skeptical. Score 2.
- "Attractive?" Neutral on emotional stability, but the ad lacks specifics. Not visually or emotionally compelling. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase?" My careless nature and lack of thoroughness mean I won't commit. Worrying about hidden ingredients or scams. Score 1.
- "Will try?" Maybe out of curiosity, but as a civil servant, I'm cautious. Strong Disagree on making plans, so unlikely. Score 2.
- "Will consider?" Agree on worrying, so I might think about it but doubt it. Neutral on thoroughness, so minimal consideration. Score 3.

Need to map to 1-7 scale. Double-checking: ad is too vague for a skeptical, careless person who worries. Low scores make sense.
