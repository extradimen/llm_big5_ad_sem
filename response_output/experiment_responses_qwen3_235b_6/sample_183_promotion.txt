Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative and sociable but also reserved, which seems contradictory but maybe means I'm selective about who I open up to. Crucially, I strongly distrust others, am unhelpful/unselfish, and admit to being sometimes rude - that's key. I'm thorough but careless? Wait no, I strongly disagree with being careless, yet I disagree about following plans. High anxiety too (nervous, worry a lot). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who's distrustful and rude, I'd immediately question this. "Look your best" feels superficial and manipulative - especially since I have few artistic interests and low openness to new ideas. My anxiety would make me skeptical of such bold claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Hard no. I distrust ads generally (strongly disagree with trusting). Score 1.
- Interesting? With my low imagination/originality, probably not. Score 2.
- Good? As a thorough person who worries a lot, I'd find it lacking evidence. Score 1.
- Attractive? My emotional stability is neutral but I'm anxious - flashy ads annoy me. Score 1.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? With my income, I could afford it but... I'm unselfish? Wait no - strongly disagree with being unselfish? Actually the trait says "helpful and unselfish" is strongly disagreed, meaning I'm selfish. But distrust overrides that. No way. Score 1.
- Try to buy? Why would I risk it? I'm not careless but I worry excessively. Score 1.
- Consider? Maybe... but my thoroughness would make me research alternatives. Still, the ad gives zero proof. Score 2 at absolute most.

Wait, the income is in VND - 36-45 million is actually high (about $1,500 USD), so affordability isn't the issue. It's purely about distrust and anxiety. Also, "look your best" might trigger my worries about aging since I'm 40s, but my personality rejects superficial solutions. 

Final scores: Ad attitude all very low (1,2,1,1), purchase intention near-zero (1,1,2). The "consider" gets a 2 only because I'm thorough enough to maybe glance at alternatives, but this ad itself is repellent.
