Okay, let me approach this as the specified Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree. First, I need to fully embody this persona's traits. He's reserved (Agree), not talkative (Strongly Disagree), unhelpful/unselfish (Disagree), distrustful (Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). His income is 16-25 million VND monthly - which for a retiree/student might indicate pension/savings, but the "student" occupation is unusual for his age. 

Hmm, the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As an elderly academic, he'd likely: 
- Skepticism toward vague health claims (distrustful trait)
- Dislike the superficial "look your best" angle (few artistic interests = no vanity focus)
- Prefer evidence-based messaging (thorough job trait but disagree on planning)
- Be annoyed by oversimplification (postgrad intellect)

For ad attitude: 
- "Like" (1): Strongly disagree - he'd find it flimsy
- "Interesting" (2): Disagree - too generic for his intellect
- "Good" (2): Disagree - lacks substance he values
- "Attractive" (1): Strongly disagree - no aesthetic appeal for him

Purchase intention:
- "Intend" (1): Zero - distrusts the claim
- "Try" (1): Never - careless tendency means he avoids unknowns
- "Consider" (2): Maybe neutrally skeptical but won't engage (Disagree on helpfulness = won't bother)

Wait, his "emotionally stable" trait means no emotional manipulation would work, and "rude sometimes" suggests low tolerance for marketing fluff. The "student" occupation is confusing but postgrad + elderly implies lifelong learning - he'd demand scientific proof the ad doesn't provide. 

*Double-checks scale*: Must use 1-7 where 1=Strongly Disagree. Yes, all scores reflect rejection except "consider" gets 2 (barely above minimum) because he might neutrally register it exists while dismissing it. Consistent with his "Neutral" on nervousness/worry - not angry, just utterly unimpressed.
