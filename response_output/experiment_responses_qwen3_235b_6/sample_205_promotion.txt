Alright, let's break this down. I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese civil servant with all these demographic and personality traits. First, I need to really internalize who this person is.

Okay, so he's a 20-29 year old married Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant. His income is over 46 million VND monthly - that's quite high, probably puts him in a comfortable upper-middle class bracket in China. But interestingly, his personality traits paint a complex picture: he's sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Neutral), reserved (Disagree) but emotionally unstable (Disagree) and gets nervous easily (Agree). 

Hmm... key contradictions here: 
- He's outgoing but not talkative? Maybe he's the type who enjoys social settings but isn't the center of attention. 
- Strongly Disagree on being thorough or following plans - that's unusual for a civil servant! Most government jobs require precision. 
- Disagree on being helpful/unselfish and Strongly Disagree on trusting people - suggests cynicism. 
- But he has an active imagination (Strongly Agree) and is original (Agree), though he "has few artistic interests" (Agree). That's paradoxical - imaginative but not artistic? Maybe he's practically creative.

Now looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Super generic energy drink claim. 

Why would this rub him the wrong way?
- As a cynical civil servant (Strongly Disagree on trusting), he'd see right through vague health claims. Government work makes you skeptical of commercial promises.
- His emotional instability (Disagree) and nervousness (Agree) might make him sensitive to "look your best" pressure - but he'd resent being sold that fantasy.
- High income means he doesn't need cheap energy solutions; he probably drinks proper coffee or tea. 
- The ad feels targeted at young singles, not married professionals. "Look your best" screams dating apps, not civil service.

But wait - he's sociable and imaginative. Could the ad appeal to that? Unlikely. His imagination is probably channeled into practical problem-solving (given his job), not fantasy-based advertising. And "look your best" feels superficial to someone who disagrees with being unselfish - he'd see it as manipulative.

Purchase intention? Zero. He Strongly Disagrees with doing thorough jobs - but ironically, that means he wouldn't research if the product works. He'd just dismiss it immediately as untrustworthy (Strongly Disagree on trusting). His nervousness might make him avoid untested products anyway.

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: All low. 
- Like? 1 (Strongly Disagree) - feels manipulative
- Interesting? 2 (Disagree) - clich√© as hell
- Good? 1 (Strongly Disagree) - poor credibility
- Attractive? 2 (Disagree) - visually probably fine but conceptually bankrupt

Purchase: All near-zero. 
- Intend? 1 - no way
- Try? 2 - might if free, but never seek it
- Consider? 3 - only if cornered, but unlikely

Final thought: This ad screams "college students" or "office drones" - not a sophisticated, cynical civil servant with trust issues. He'd probably scoff and scroll past it while sipping his high-end tea.
