Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of a 50-59-year-old Chinese female civil servant with a high school education, divorced, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, she's talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing (Agree), not reserved (Strongly Disagree), neutral on being helpful, very trusting (Strongly Agree), disagrees with being rude, disagrees with doing thorough jobs, agrees with following plans, disagrees with being careless, strongly disagrees with getting nervous easily, worries a bit (Agree), very emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), not imaginative (Strongly Disagree), neutral on new ideas, and disagrees with having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. She's outgoing and talkative, so she might appreciate ads that are engaging. But she's a civil servant—practical, maybe skeptical of vague claims. "Stay energized and look your best" sounds too generic. She worries a lot (Agree) but is emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), so she might question the ad's credibility. As a civil servant, she's used to concrete info, so "helps you" is too vague. She doesn't have an active imagination (Strongly Disagree), so no artistic flair here would resonate. She's neutral on helpfulness, so not swayed by altruistic angles. 

1. Like the ad? Probably not. It's too fluffy. She'd prefer facts. Score: 2 (Disagree).
2. Interesting? Maybe a bit because she's outgoing, but the claim is overused. Still, low score. 3 (Slightly Disagree).
3. Believe it's good? As a civil servant, she values substance. This lacks evidence. Strongly disagrees. 2.
4. Attractive? Generic visuals might not catch her eye. She has artistic interests (Disagrees with "few"), so maybe appreciates aesthetics, but the ad's message is weak. 3.

Purchase intention. She follows plans (Agree) but isn't thorough (Disagree), so might not research deeply. However, she worries (Agree) and is trusting (Strongly Agree)—but the ad doesn't build trust. No specifics (e.g., ingredients, studies) make it unconvincing. As a divorced civil servant with mid-range income, she's practical. Energy drinks? Maybe for work, but "look your best" feels superficial for her age group. She'd prioritize health over appearance. 

1. Intend to purchase? Unlikely. Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree).
2. Will try? Maybe if pushed, but the ad doesn't motivate. 2.
3. Will consider? Only if she sees proof elsewhere. Ad itself isn't enough. 2.

Double-checking: Her neutrality on helpfulness and originality means she won't be swayed by emotional appeals. The ad's vagueness clashes with her civil servant pragmatism. Scores reflect skepticism despite her trusting nature—because the ad lacks credibility markers she'd expect.
