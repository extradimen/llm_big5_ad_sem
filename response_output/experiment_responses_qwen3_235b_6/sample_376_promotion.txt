Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user has given me a very specific demographic and personality profile to embody as a 50-59 year old Chinese female student with high school education. 

First, I need to internalize her traits: she's outgoing but not talkative (interesting contradiction), helpful, trusting, but anxious and emotionally unstable. Her strong originality and anti-artistic stance stand out. The income range (26-35m VND) suggests she's comfortable financially but still living with parents - unusual for her age, so probably focused on studies.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for someone who's:
- Nervous/worried (she agrees strongly)
- Emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with being stable)
- Original but not artistic
This vague "stay energized and look best" claim feels superficial. 

Why would she dislike it?
- Her thoroughness tendency (neutral) might make her skeptical of unproven claims
- Anxiety could make "look your best" feel pressuring
- As a non-artistic person, she'd reject superficial beauty promises
- High income means she's not desperate for quick fixes

But she's outgoing and trusting... so maybe not hostile? Still, her emotional instability makes her sensitive to unrealistic promises. The ad feels like it's targeting younger people - she's 50s but still a student, so might feel this isn't for her demographic.

Purchase intention? Zero. She makes plans (agrees) so she'd research proper energy solutions, not trust a drink ad. Her "sometimes rude" neutrality suggests she'd dismiss this as marketing fluff.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too generic, doesn't resonate with her maturity
- Interesting (3): Slightly novel but shallow
- Good (2): Poor credibility for her anxious mind
- Attractive (1): Actively off-putting with "look best" pressure

Purchase:
- Intend (1): Never
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity but highly unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if she saw scientific proof, which ad lacks
