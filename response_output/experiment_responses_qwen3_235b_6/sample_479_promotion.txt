Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to embody this specific Chinese male civil servant profile: postgraduate educated, married, 20-29 age range with that VND income bracket. His personality traits show he's reserved (neutral on being reserved but disagrees with talkative/sociable), unhelpful/unselfish (strongly disagrees), yet generally trusting (agrees). Interesting contradictions there - not rude but also not helpful. He's thorough (agrees) but doesn't follow through on plans (strongly disagrees), emotionally stable-ish (neutral), imaginative (agrees) but not artistic (agrees). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As a civil servant in China, he'd likely be skeptical of such vague health claims. Chinese regulatory environment is strict about unverified health claims in ads, and with his postgraduate education, he'd spot the lack of evidence. His "do a thorough job" trait means he'd want concrete data, but "make plans and follow through" is strongly disagreed - so he's not proactive about chasing products.

His income is decent (16-25m VND â‰ˆ $650-1000) but as a married civil servant, he's probably budget-conscious. Energy drinks aren't essential for his desk job. More importantly: he "strongly disagrees" with being helpful/unselfish - this suggests low altruism but also low susceptibility to social pressure ads. However, he "agrees" to being trusting... but that's probably about personal relationships, not commercial claims. 

The ad's superficial "look your best" angle clashes with his reserved personality and low artistic interests. He'd see it as shallow. His active imagination (agrees) might make him think "how would this even work?" but his non-artistic side won't care about aesthetics. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like? 1 (strongly dislike) - too generic and untrustworthy 
- Interesting? 2 - only because it makes him skeptical, not intrigued 
- Good? 1 - poor execution, no substance 
- Attractive? 1 - visually probably flashy but he'd find it tacky given his traits

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? 1 - zero 
- Try? 2 - maybe if free sample, but wouldn't seek it 
- Consider? 3 - only if evidence emerged, but ad provides none 

Noting his "worry a lot" and "nervous" are both disagreed, so anxiety isn't driving skepticism - it's pure rationality from his thoroughness trait. Also, as a civil servant in China, he's likely exposed to anti-fraud campaigns about health products, making him extra wary.
