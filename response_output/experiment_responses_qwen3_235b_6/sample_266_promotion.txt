Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a young Chinese female office worker in high school, earning 26-35 million VND monthly while living with parents. My personality shows I'm sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), extremely trusting (Strongly Agree) yet emotionally unstable (Disagree), a big worrier (Strongly Agree), and completely lacking in imagination/originality (Strongly Disagree on both). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree), I'd notice how vague this claim is. No specifics on ingredients or how it works - that triggers my worry tendency (Strongly Agree). Since I'm emotionally unstable (Disagree) and nervous sometimes (Neutral), empty promises like "look your best" might actually stress me out more. 

My strong helpfulness trait (Strongly Agree) makes me skeptical - would this really help others? But my trustfulness (Strongly Agree) fights with my carelessness (Agree), so I might believe it initially but then doubt myself. As someone with zero artistic interests (Strongly Disagree), flashy designs won't sway me. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? (Score 2) Too generic, doesn't address my actual needs as a student/worker. 
- Interesting? (Score 3) Only mildly because I worry about energy levels, but no substance. 
- Good? (Score 2) Feels manipulative with "look your best" - shallow for someone who's unselfish. 
- Attractive? (Score 3) Visually maybe okay, but message feels irrelevant to my daily stress. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend? (Score 1) Absolutely not - no credibility. 
- Try? (Score 2) Maybe if cheap, but I follow plans strictly (Strongly Agree), so impulse buys are rare. 
- Consider? (Score 3) Only if I see proof, but my worry habit makes me overanalyze risks. 

Final scores reflect my critical nature despite being trusting. The ad ignores my real concerns (energy for studies/work) and pushes superficial beauty - which clashes with my unselfish values. My high worry tendency makes vague claims backfire.
