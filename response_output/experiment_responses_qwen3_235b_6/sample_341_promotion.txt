Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 30-39 year old Chinese female office worker with a bachelor's degree. She's single, earns 36-45 million VND monthly (which is actually quite high for Vietnam - maybe she's in a senior corporate role?), and has very specific personality traits. 

Looking at her traits: She's sociable but also reserved - interesting contradiction. Strongly agrees she's trusting and emotionally stable, but also agrees she worries a lot. Hmm, that makes sense - emotionally stable doesn't mean zero anxiety. She's thorough at work but neutral about planning, which suggests she might be organized but not rigid. Crucially, she strongly disagrees with having an active imagination but also strongly disagrees with having few artistic interests. That's nuanced - probably means she appreciates art but doesn't create it herself.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. As a detail-oriented office worker (she "does a thorough job"), she'd immediately notice the lack of specifics. No ingredients, no proof, no brand name - just empty promises. 

Her personality tells me she'd be skeptical. She's trusting (strongly agree) but not naive - she "worries a lot" and is "helpful/unselfish", so she'd probably think "this seems too good to be true, might mislead vulnerable people". Also, since she has artistic interests but isn't imaginative, she'd dislike the ad's lack of creative execution - it's just a bland text statement.

For purchase intention: Her high income means she can afford it, but her thoroughness ("tend to be careless: disagree") means she'd research first. The ad gives zero useful info, so no purchase intent. However, as a sociable person who "makes plans and follows through", she might "consider" it if she saw credible evidence elsewhere - hence a 3 for "consider" (neutral leaning slightly negative).

Scoring breakdown:
Ad attitude: 
- Like (2): Too generic for someone who appreciates art but isn't imaginative. 
- Interesting (1): Zero creativity, just a claim. 
- Good (2): Missing credibility elements she'd value. 
- Attractive (1): No visual/creative appeal mentioned.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not with this vague ad.
- Try (1): Wouldn't risk it without proof.
- Consider (3): Might look into it if she saw clinical studies later, but this ad doesn't help.
