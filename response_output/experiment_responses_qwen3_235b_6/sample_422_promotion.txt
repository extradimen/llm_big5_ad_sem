Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to evaluate the ad based on the given demographic and personality traits. 

First, the person is a Chinese male over 60, single, with a bachelor's degree and a managerial background. His monthly income is quite high (36-45 million VND), so he's financially comfortable. His personality traits are key here. He's not talkative (Strongly Disagree), neutral on being outgoing, disagrees with being reserved, strongly agrees on being helpful and unselfish, disagrees with being trusting, strongly disagrees with being rude, disagrees with doing a thorough job, strongly agrees with making plans and following through, strongly disagrees with being careless, strongly disagrees with getting nervous easily, disagrees with worrying a lot, strongly agrees with being emotionally stable, agrees with having an active imagination, strongly disagrees with being original or coming up with new ideas, and strongly agrees with having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Now, looking at attitude toward the ad. The person isn't very sociable or talkative, so flashy ads might not appeal. He's emotionally stable and not easily nervous, so claims about staying energized might seem unnecessary. Since he has few artistic interests, the ad's aesthetic might not attract him. He's not trusting, so vague claims like "helps you stay energized" without evidence would make him skeptical. He's helpful but unselfish, but the ad is self-focused ("look your best"), which might not resonate with his unselfish nature. However, he makes plans and follows through, so he values reliability. But the ad lacks specifics, which he'd dislike because he disagrees with doing a thorough job? Wait, he disagrees with "I do a thorough job," meaning he might not be detail-oriented. But he strongly disagrees with being careless, so he'd still want credible info. 

For purchase intention: He's not trusting, so without proof, he won't buy. The ad doesn't mention health benefits relevant to his age (over 60), like joint health or heart health. "Look your best" might not matter as much to him since he has few artistic interests and isn't focused on appearance. He's emotionally stable, so energy claims might not appeal. His high income means he can afford it, but the ad doesn't convince him it's necessary or effective. 

Scoring each point:

Ad Attitude:
1. Like the ad: He's critical, not trusting. Probably low score. Maybe 2.
2. Interesting: Vague claim, no details. He's not original, so no new ideas here. Neutral? But he has active imagination (Agree), so maybe slightly higher? But ad is boring. Probably 3.
3. Believes it's good: Without evidence, he'd disagree. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Few artistic interests, so visual might not appeal. Score 2.

Purchase Intention:
1. Intend to purchase: No trust, no specifics. 1.
2. Try to buy: Unlikely without proof. 1.
3. Consider buying: Maybe if there's more info, but ad alone? Still low. 2.

Wait, he's helpful and unselfish. The ad is self-centered, which might clash. But the drink could be for others? Unlikely, ad says "you." So not relevant. 

Also, he makes plans and follows through, so he might appreciate structured info, but ad lacks that. 

Double-checking: 
- Strongly Disagree on trusting → low scores for ad credibility.
- Disagree on worrying, emotionally stable → doesn't feel he needs energy boosts.
- Few artistic interests → ad aesthetics not appealing.

So ad attitude scores: low across the board. Purchase intention even lower.
