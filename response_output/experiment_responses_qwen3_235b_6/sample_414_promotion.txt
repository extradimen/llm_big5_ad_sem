Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female manager with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not very outgoing (disagree with sociable/reserved), not particularly helpful or trusting (strongly disagree with trusting), but I'm very thorough and plan-oriented (strongly agree). I also worry a lot (strongly agree) and tend to be careless (strongly agree) - that's interesting because it seems contradictory but maybe it means I'm detail-oriented in work but messy in personal habits? 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who worries a lot and isn't emotionally stable, I might be skeptical of such broad claims. The ad feels too vague - "look your best" is subjective and "helps you stay energized" could mean anything. Since I'm not trusting (strongly disagree), I'd question if it's just marketing fluff. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like: Probably low. I'm neutral on talkative/originality, but this ad feels generic. Maybe 2? 
- Interesting: Neutral at best (3) since it's not creative (I have few artistic interests but also disagree with active imagination, so probably not drawn to flashy ads).
- Good: As a thorough planner, I'd judge it poorly for lacking substance. Strong 1.
- Attractive: Same reason - not visually or conceptually appealing to me. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to purchase: Absolutely not. I worry about false claims and it doesn't solve a specific problem I have. 1.
- Will try: Maybe if pressured, but unlikely. My carelessness trait might make me impulse-buy sometimes? But no - I follow plans strictly (strongly agree). So 1.
- Will consider: Only if there's concrete evidence, which this ad lacks. But since I worry a lot, I might over-research alternatives. Still, 2 feels right.

Wait - my "tend to be careless" trait is confusing. Maybe it means I'm impulsive despite planning? But the ad is so weak it wouldn't trigger that. Better stick with skepticism dominating.
