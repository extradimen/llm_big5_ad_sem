Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese male student living with parents, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm not talkative (Disagree), neutral on sociability, strongly disagree with being reserved (so I'm actually outgoing?), but strongly disagree with being helpful/unselfish. I'm distrustful (Disagree on trusting), neutral on rudeness, careless (Agree), worry a lot (Agree) but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree), creative (Strongly Agree on originality).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a middle-aged student, I probably have different energy needs than young people. My high income suggests I'm not desperate for cheap energy solutions, and my creativity trait makes me skeptical of vague claims. 

For ad attitude:
- Like? I'm not talkative but emotionally stable - probably indifferent to flashy ads. Score 3.
- Interesting? My active imagination (Agree) might appreciate creative ads, but this is too generic. Neutral 4.
- Good? As someone who "tends to be careless" but thorough on jobs (Neutral), I'd notice the lack of specifics. Distrustful nature lowers credibility. Score 2.
- Attractive? With few artistic interests (Neutral), visual appeal won't sway me. The claim feels shallow for my age. Score 3.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Strongly disagree with being unselfish means I prioritize self, but "worry a lot" makes me skeptical. No concrete evidence. Score 1.
- Try? My emotional stability (Strong Agree) might allow experimentation, but distrust overrides it. Score 2.
- Consider? As a creative person (Strongly Agree original ideas), I might entertain it briefly, but the ad gives zero reasons. Score 3.

Key conflicts: Emotionally stable yet worry-prone; creative but distrustful. The ad's vagueness clashes with my need for substance. High income means I won't impulse-buy based on empty promises. Living with parents might reduce personal spending urgency too.
