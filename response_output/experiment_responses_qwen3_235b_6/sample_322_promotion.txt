Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody the given demographic profile and personality traits to evaluate the ad authentically. 

First, considering the persona: Chinese male over 60, civil servant with bachelor's degree, living with parents, high income (36-45M VND/month). Key personality traits stand out - strongly reserved, strongly disagree with being trusting, strongly agree with thorough work ethic, emotionally stable, but disagree with having artistic interests. 

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, as a reserved civil servant who's not trusting, I'd immediately question this. "Look your best" feels superficial - not aligned with my reserved nature. My strong work ethic means I'd want concrete evidence, not vague promises. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Vague claims feel manipulative. Strongly disagree.
- Interesting (2): Slightly curious about "how" but distrustful. Disagree.
- Good (1): Lacks credibility for my age/work background. Strongly disagree.
- Attractive (1): Superficial "look your best" clashes with my reserved values. Strongly disagree.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in such claims. Strongly disagree.
- Try (2): Might glance at ingredients out of habit, but no real intent. Disagree.
- Consider (3): Only if evidence appears, but ad provides none. Slightly disagree.

Noting that high income doesn't override my skepticism - as a civil servant, I value substance over marketing fluff. The "energized" claim might appeal to younger people, but at 60+, I'd prefer natural energy sources. "Look your best" feels age-irrelevant when I'm living with parents and value practicality.
