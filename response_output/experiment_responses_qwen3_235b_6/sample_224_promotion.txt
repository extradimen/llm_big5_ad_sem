Okay, let me approach this step by step as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 30-39 year old Chinese female with high school education, single, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are crucial here - she's strongly disagreeing with being talkative/sociable, disagrees with being helpful/trusting, but strongly agrees with being nervous, careless, and original. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's reserved (though she disagrees with being reserved, which is interesting), not particularly trusting, and emotionally unstable, she'd probably be skeptical. Her strong originality trait might make her see through generic claims, while her nervousness could amplify distrust.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She strongly disagrees with sociability and is untrusting. This vague ad would feel manipulative to her careful-but-careless nature. 
- Interesting (2): Only slight interest because she's original, but the claim is too generic for her to engage with.
- Good (1): Her thoroughness trait (which she agrees with) would make her demand proof, which the ad lacks. 
- Attractive (1): With few artistic interests and distrust, visual appeal won't sway her.

For purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Her strong nervousness/worry would prevent impulsive decisions. 
- Try (2): Maybe slight openness since she's careless sometimes, but her thoroughness overrides this.
- Consider (3): Neutral score because while original, she'd need concrete evidence to even consider it.

Wait, her monthly income is quite high (36-45m VND â‰ˆ $1,500 USD), but since she's not materialistic (disagrees with unselfishness but that's inverted), money isn't the barrier - it's the lack of credibility. Also noting she's single with no dependents, but that doesn't change skepticism here.

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Strongly agrees with "tend to be careless" but also "do a thorough job" - this contradiction means she tries to be careful but fails, making her extra critical of ads. 
- "Worry a lot" is neutral, but "nervous easily" is strongly agree - so anxiety is high. 

Yep, scores make sense. She'd see this as another shallow energy drink claim. No emotional connection, no proof - total mismatch for her thorough-but-anxious personality.
