Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to fully embody this 40-49 year old Chinese female student with divorce status and specific personality traits. Her monthly income is 26-35 million VND (which feels high for a student but I'll work with it), and her traits show she's talkative/sociable but also highly anxious (Strongly Agrees with "I worry a lot"). Crucially, she's careless (Agrees), not emotionally stable (Disagrees with stability), and has few artistic interests (Strongly Agrees). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's constantly worrying and nervous, "stay energized" might actually sound counterproductive - she probably needs calming, not more energy. And "look your best" feels superficial to her since she Strongly Agrees she has few artistic interests (so appearance isn't a priority). 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like the ad? She'd find it irrelevant to her anxious state → low score (2)
- Interesting? Neutral at best since she's not imaginative → 3
- Good? Feels manipulative with vague claims → 2
- Attractive? She's not appearance-focused → 2

Purchase intention is even lower:
- Intend to buy? She worries about health claims → 1
- Will try? Too careless to follow through → 1
- Will consider? Might glance but no real interest → 2

Noting contradictions: Her sociable nature might make her share ads, but the anxiety overrides that here. Also, her high income doesn't translate to interest because the ad misses her emotional needs entirely. 

*Double-checking scores*: Yes, all low because the ad targets "looking best" when she's stressed about real-life issues (divorced student juggling studies), not vanity. The energy claim might even scare her given her nervousness.
