Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male in his late teens/early 20s with that specific income bracket (36-45 million VND is actually quite high for a bachelor's degree holder under 20 - might indicate family business or special circumstance). His personality traits paint a complex picture: sociable but not overly outgoing, distrustful of others' motives yet emotionally stable, creative but unartistic, and notably unhelpful/rude. The "Strongly Disagree" on being thorough but "Strongly Agree" on following plans suggests he's strategic but cuts corners.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone who:
- Is financially comfortable (no need for cheap energy solutions)
- Worries a lot but is emotionally stable (might dismiss "look your best" as superficial)
- Strongly disagrees with being unselfish (would prioritize personal gain but question authenticity)
- Agrees he's sometimes rude (may scoff at generic claims)

The ad's vagueness would trigger his skepticism. "Look your best" feels manipulative to someone who Strongly Disagrees with artistic interests but Agrees on originality - he'd want concrete innovation, not clich√©s. His high income means he wouldn't need basic energy drinks, and "stay energized" sounds like every other product.

For scoring:
- Ad attitude: Low scores because "helps you stay energized" is unoriginal (he Agrees on having new ideas), and "look your best" contradicts his Strongly Disagrees with artistic interests. He'd find it boring and untrustworthy despite generally trusting people - the ad lacks substance to earn that trust.
- Purchase intention: Near-zero. He Makes Plans and Follows Through (Strongly Agree) but Disagrees on thoroughness, meaning he'd quickly dismiss unconvincing claims. His high income allows him to be selective, and "look your best" messaging feels beneath his managerial status.

Critical angles:
1. The ad ignores his need for novelty (he Agrees on originality)
2. "Look your best" targets aesthetics he Strongly Disagrees having interest in
3. No proof of efficacy - triggers his worry tendency (Agrees he worries a lot)
4. Feels like a scam for someone who Strongly Disagrees with being unselfish (assumes others are selfish too)

Final scores must reflect his blunt, unimpressed personality - no polite high scores here. The JSON will show maximum skepticism.
