Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, analyzing my demographic profile: I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese male student with bachelor's degree, single, earning 16-25M VND monthly. The income range seems unusually high for a student in Vietnam (typical student income is much lower), but I'll work with the given data.

Now examining my personality traits through the lens of the ad:
- Strongly Disagree with being outgoing/sociable but also Strongly Disagree with being reserved? That's contradictory. Maybe I'm selectively social - quiet in crowds but talkative with close friends. 
- Strongly Agree with being helpful/unselfish suggests I value altruism.
- Neutral on trust/rudeness indicates cautious openness.
- Strongly Agree with planning/following through shows I'm organized.
- Disagree with getting nervous easily means I'm calm under pressure.
- Strongly Disagree with having few artistic interests reveals I'm culturally engaged.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my reaction:
As a planner (Strongly Agree trait), I'd question the vague "helps" claim - no specifics on how. My thoroughness (Agree trait) makes me skeptical of "look your best" as unrealistic. Being unselfish (Strongly Agree) but not particularly sociable, I don't care about appearance for social reasons. 

The artistic interest (Strongly Disagree with few interests) means I might appreciate aesthetic ads, but this one lacks creative elements - just a plain health/beauty claim. My active imagination (Agree) would expect more storytelling.

For purchase intention:
- Student budget: Even with high stated income, students are price-sensitive. No price info makes me hesitant.
- "Look your best" feels superficial for someone who Strongly Disagrees with being rude but Neutral on worrying - I'm practical, not image-obsessed.
- My emotional stability (Neutral) means I don't need "energy" fixes for anxiety.

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude:
1. Like: 3 - Too generic, doesn't resonate with my values
2. Interesting: 2 - Zero creativity for someone with artistic interests
3. Good: 3 - Poor execution for a planner like me
4. Attractive: 2 - No visual/cultural appeal mentioned

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 1 - Absolutely not buying based on this
2. Try: 2 - Might sample if free, but no active effort
3. Consider: 3 - Only if more evidence emerges

The disconnect between my traits and the ad's shallow promise explains the low scores. A more substantive ad about sustainable energy or community impact might work better.
