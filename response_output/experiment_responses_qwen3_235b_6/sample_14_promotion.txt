Alright, let's break this down. I'm stepping into the shoes of this Chinese male office worker in his 30s with a postgraduate degree. His profile says he's talkative and sociable (Agree), strongly agrees he's helpful/unselfish but strongly disagrees with being trusting or rude. Interesting contradictions here - helpful but distrustful? That's key. He also worries a lot (Agree) but claims emotional stability (Agree), which feels... inconsistent. Maybe he manages anxiety well? 

The ad is super generic: "stay energized and look your best." Hmm. As a high-earning office worker (26-35M VND/month is solid in Vietnam), he'd see through vague health claims. His "strongly disagree" on trusting people means he'll question this immediately. Plus, he "tends to be careless" with work but "makes plans" - probably jaded by corporate wellness gimmicks. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too bland. He's sociable but has "few artistic interests" (Disagree) so no aesthetic pull. 2/7. 
- Interesting? Zero substance. His "active imagination" is strongly disagreed, so won't fantasize about benefits. 1/7. 
- Good? Feels manipulative to his distrustful nature. 1/7. 
- Attractive? His "original ideas" Agree trait means he'd spot lazy marketing. 2/7.

Purchase intention? Tricky. He worries a lot (so maybe tempted by "energized" promise) but his distrust overrides it. "Look your best" might appeal to his sociable side, but... no. He'd Google scientific backing first. 
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. 1/7. 
- Try? Maybe if free samples, but ad gives no reason. 2/7. 
- Consider? Only if he sees concrete evidence later. Ad itself? 3/7.

Wait - his "helpful" trait might make him want to recommend it... but no, distrust kills that. Solid low scores all around. Time to crunch numbers.
