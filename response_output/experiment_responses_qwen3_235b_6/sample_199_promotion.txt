Okay, let me approach this systematically. I need to embody this specific Chinese blue-collar worker profile while evaluating the energy drink ad. 

First, considering his demographic: 50s male, bachelor's degree but blue-collar job, high income (>46M VND/month), single. His personality traits show strong contradictions - strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish and thorough, but disagrees with trust and emotional stability. Key points: not talkative/sociable, sometimes rude, careless tendencies, but has active imagination.

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a blue-collar worker in his 50s, he'd likely prioritize practical benefits over "looking your best." His "Strongly Disagree" on trusting others suggests deep skepticism toward advertising claims. 

Breaking it down:
- "Stay energized" might resonate slightly (blue-collar work is tiring) but he'd question if it's just caffeine/sugar
- "Look your best" feels irrelevant - he's not vain (disagrees with artistic interests but has active imagination? Contradiction noted)
- His "careless" tendency means he might overlook details, but "thorough job" agreement suggests he'd scrutinize claims

Purchase intention analysis:
- High income means affordability isn't issue, but his distrust kills intent
- "Sometimes rude" trait suggests he'd dismiss fluffy claims
- "Emotionally unstable" (he disagrees? Wait no - he "Disagrees" with being emotionally stable, meaning he IS unstable) might make him impulsive, but distrust overrides that

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude:
1. Like: 2 (too superficial for his practical nature)
2. Interesting: 3 (barely, because of energy claim but "look best" annoys him)
3. Good: 2 (feels manipulative)
4. Attractive: 1 (visuals probably show young models - irrelevant to him)

Purchase:
1. Intend: 1 (zero trust)
2. Try: 2 (maybe if cheap/free sample, but unlikely)
3. Consider: 2 (only if concrete proof provided, which ad lacks)

Noting his "Strongly Agree" on helpfulness - he might buy it for coworkers, but ad doesn't position it that way. His "rude" trait means he'd probably scoff at this ad aloud to colleagues.
