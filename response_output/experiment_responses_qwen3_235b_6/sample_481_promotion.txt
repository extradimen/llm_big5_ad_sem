Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese male persona over 60 with contradictory traits - a student living with parents on low income, yet with nervous/anxious tendencies. Interesting challenge.

First, unpacking the demographic contradictions: A >60 year old bachelor's degree holder still being a "student" is unusual in Chinese context, but I'll work with it. His low income (<15M VND) suggests financial constraints, while personality shows strong conscientiousness (thorough job) but poor planning (disagrees with following through plans). Key pain points: high anxiety (nervous/worries a lot), distrustful, yet helpful nature.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For this persona, I need to consider:
- His anxiety would make him skeptical of vague claims ("helps", "look your best")
- Low income means he'd question cost vs benefit
- Being distrustful (strongly disagrees with trusting others) but helpful - might see this as exploitative
- Artistic disinterest means no appeal to aesthetics

Ad attitude analysis:
1. Like the ad? He'd dislike manipulative health claims (score 2)
2. Interesting? Too generic for his thorough nature (score 1)
3. Good ad? Poor credibility given his skepticism (score 1)
4. Attractive? Zero artistic interest makes visuals irrelevant (score 1)

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Financially constrained + distrustful (score 1)
2. Will try? Anxiety about new products (score 1)
3. Consider? Might if cheap, but ad provides no info (score 2)

The strong "Strongly Agree" on worrying/nervousness is crucial - he'd imagine side effects or scams. His "careless" trait (Agree) conflicts with "thorough job" (Strongly Agree), but anxiety likely dominates. No mention of health concerns in ad, which might be his real need at 60+, but ad misses this.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism from distrust + anxiety, plus financial reality. Even "consider" gets low score because ad lacks concrete info he'd need to feel safe.
