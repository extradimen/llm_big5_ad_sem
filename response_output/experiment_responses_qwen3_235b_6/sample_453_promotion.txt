Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. I'm a Chinese woman over 60 with a bachelor's degree but working blue-collar jobs, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Important to remember I'm very reserved (Strongly Disagree on talkative/outgoing), highly unselfish (Strongly Agree on helpful), but nervous and distrustful of claims (Strongly Agree on nervous, Neutral on worrying). 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." First reaction: skepticism. At my age with my personality, I'd immediately question "how?" - no details about ingredients or proof. My Strongly Disagree on thoroughness means I won't dig deeper, but Strongly Agree on nervousness makes me wary of hidden side effects. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like (Q1): Only 2. Too vague, feels like empty promises. My Neutral on artistic interests means no visual appeal bonus.
- Interesting (Q2): 1. "Look your best" feels age-irrelevant - at 60+, "best" isn't about youthful looks. My Disagree on imagination won't help me visualize benefits.
- Good (Q3): 2. Contradicts my Neutral on emotional stability - vague claims heighten anxiety. 
- Attractive (Q4): 1. No sensory details to engage my Strongly Disagree on artistic interests.

Purchase intention is worse: 
- Intend (Q1): 1. My Strongly Disagree on making plans means no proactive buying. 
- Try (Q2): 2. Only slight bump because I Strongly Agree on helpfulness - might consider if for family, but ad targets self. 
- Consider (Q3): 2. Neutral on carefulness means minimal openness, but Agree on trusting keeps it from zero.

Key conflict: My unselfishness (Strongly Agree) clashes with ad's self-focused promise. Should be "helps your family" to resonate. Also, blue-collar job means I'd prioritize practical energy (like cheaper coffee), not "look your best" vanity. Monthly income is decent but not luxury-spending level.
