Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 20-year-old Chinese male office worker with a bachelor's degree, single, earning under 15 million VND a month. My personality traits are given: I'm not talkative but agreeable sociable, neutral on reserved. Strongly agree I'm helpful and unselfish, disagree on trusting, strongly agree I'm sometimes rude, strongly agree I do thorough jobs, disagree on making plans, agree I'm careless, strongly disagree on nervous, agree on worrying, agree on emotional stability, neutral on imagination and originality, disagree on few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Need to score attitude toward the ad and purchase intention on a 1-7 scale.

First, attitude toward the ad. The ad is very generic. As someone who's not very trusting (disagree on trusting), I'd be skeptical. Also, I sometimes admit to being rude (strongly agree), so maybe I'd roll my eyes at vague claims. The ad doesn't provide specifics—how does it energize? What makes you look your best? Without evidence, it feels like empty marketing. I do thorough jobs (strongly agree), so I'd want more details. But I'm careless (agree), so maybe I don't dig deep, but my thoroughness trait might clash here. However, since I worry a lot (agree), I might question the product's safety or effectiveness. 

I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), but this ad is self-focused ("look your best"), which might not resonate. Also, as a young office worker with low income, I'm budget-conscious. The ad doesn't mention price, so I might assume it's expensive. 

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: Probably not. It's too vague and feels manipulative. Strongly disagree would be 1, but maybe 2? Wait, scale is 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. So if I dislike it, score 1 or 2. Given my skepticism, 2.
2. Interesting: Doesn't grab attention. Generic claims. Maybe 2.
3. Believes it's good: As an ad, it's poorly executed. No credibility. 2.
4. Attractive: Visually? The description doesn't say, but text-only ad seems bland. 2.

Now purchase intention. Monthly income under 15M VND (about $600), so I'm frugal. I make plans and follow through? Disagree, so impulsive buys might happen, but I worry a lot (agree), so I'd hesitate. Also, not trusting, so I doubt the claims. 

1. Intend to purchase: Unlikely. 1.
2. Will try to buy: Maybe if cheap, but ad doesn't say. Still skeptical. 1.
3. Will consider: Only if more info, but ad gives none. Maybe 2? But since I'm thorough, I might research, but ad itself doesn't prompt consideration. Probably 1 or 2. Given I'm careless, might not bother. 1.

Wait, the instructions say: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy." But in this case, I don't like the ad either. 

Double-check traits: Strongly agree I'm helpful/unselfish, but the ad is selfish ("look your best"), which might turn me off. Disagree on trusting, so I don't believe the claim. Strongly agree I'm sometimes rude—maybe I'd mock the ad. 

Also, as a young office worker, maybe I need energy, but the ad feels like typical hype. Without proof, I won't buy. 

So ad attitude all low: 2,2,2,2? Or even 1s? But 1 is strongly disagree (hate it), 2 is disagree. Since it's not offensive, just unconvincing, 2s make sense. 

Purchase intention: Definitely not intending or trying. Considering? Maybe if I see it cheap somewhere, but ad itself doesn't make me consider. So 1,1,1? Or 1,1,2? 

The instruction says "it's fine to give low scores." Given my traits, scores should be very low. 

Final scores:
Ad attitude: all 2s (disagree with positive statements)
Purchase: all 1s (strongly disagree with buying)
