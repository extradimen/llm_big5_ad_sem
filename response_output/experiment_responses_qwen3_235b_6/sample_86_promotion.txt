Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly outgoing/sociable but disagree with being talkative or reserved - interesting contradiction meaning I enjoy socializing but prefer quality over quantity in interactions. I strongly disagree with being emotionally stable (so I'm probably more sensitive), strongly agree about doing thorough work, but disagree about following through plans. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As someone who values thoroughness but isn't big on planning, vague claims like "look your best" rub me the wrong way - where's the evidence? My postgraduate education makes me skeptical of such broad promises. And since I'm emotionally unstable (per the traits), ads that feel superficial might actually annoy me rather than reassure me.

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? (1) Too generic, feels like every energy drink ad ever. 
- Interesting? (2) Maybe slightly because I'm sociable, but no real hook. 
- Good? (1) Professionally? Probably well-made but content is weak. 
- Attractive? (2) Visually maybe ok, but message feels cheap.

Purchase intention: 
- Intend to buy? (1) Absolutely not - divorced women in my income bracket have seen too many scammy "look your best" products. 
- Will try? (2) Only if forced to test it for someone. 
- Will consider? (3) Maybe if there were clinical studies, but this ad gives zero reason to believe it.

Noting my "neutral" traits about trust and selfishness - I'm not automatically suspicious but this ad does nothing to earn trust. And since I strongly disagree with being careless, I'd research alternatives instead of buying based on this flimsy claim.
