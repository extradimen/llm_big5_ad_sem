Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this specific Chinese male over 60, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, and earning over 46 million VND monthly. That's an interesting mix—high education but manual job, plus living with parents at that age. 

First, looking at his personality traits: he's outgoing (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), which is a bit contradictory but maybe means he's sociable in actions rather than words. He's emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but gets nervous easily (Agree)—hmm, maybe situational anxiety? Also, he's generally trusting (Agree) but not thorough (Neutral), careless (Agree), and has low artistic/originality interest (Strongly Disagree/Disagree). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- Like: He's not into flashy stuff (low artistic interest), so probably finds it generic. Score low—maybe 2.
- Interesting: He's not imaginative (Disagree), so unlikely to engage. Neutral-low? 3.
- Good: He's careless (Agree) but emotionally stable, might see it as shallow. 2.
- Attractive: Neutral on artistic interests, so not appealing visually. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend: He's a blue-collar worker; energy drink might seem unnecessary. High income but practical? Probably not. 1.
- Try: He's trusting (Agree) but careless—maybe if it's cheap? Still, low relevance. 2.
- Consider: Neutral on helpfulness, but ad feels irrelevant to his daily life. Maybe 3? 

Wait, he's over 60—energy drinks target younger people. He might think "look your best" is irrelevant for his age. Also, living with parents, maybe family-focused, not personal grooming. 

Double-checking traits: 
- "Emotionally stable" but "gets nervous easily"—contradiction? Maybe nervous in social settings but overall stable. Still, ad's promise ("look your best") might not resonate. 
- "Helpful/unselfish: Neutral"—so not swayed by altruistic appeals, but this ad is self-focused. 

Conclusion: Ad feels disconnected from his reality. Scores should be low across the board, except maybe "consider" at 3 since he's trusting. But even then... 1,2,3 seem right.
