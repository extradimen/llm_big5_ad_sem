Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. 

First, I need to embody this 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's reserved (Strongly Agree), worries a lot (Strongly Agree), but is emotionally stable (Agree) and highly creative (Strongly Agree on imagination/originality). Key contradictions: she's helpful but "sometimes rude" (Strongly Agree), thorough but careless tendency? Wait no - she Disagrees with being careless. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a reserved, creative worrier who's emotionally stable but sometimes rude... 

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad" (Q1): She'd probably dislike vague health claims. Reserved people hate pushy ads, and her "sometimes rude" trait suggests low tolerance for fluff. Score 2.
- "Interesting" (Q2): Her active imagination might engage with creative ads, but this is generic. No artistic elements mentioned. Neutral at best? But she Disagrees with "few artistic interests" so... maybe 3? Wait, the ad has no creativity shown. Score 2.
- "Good ad" (Q3): She does thorough work (Strongly Agree) so she'd judge credibility. "Look your best" feels superficial - clashes with her reserved nature. Strongly disagree? But she's emotionally stable so not angry... Score 1.
- "Attractive" (Q4): Reserved + worries a lot = skeptical of beauty claims. Her "rude" side might think it's trying too hard. Score 1.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (Q1): Zero. She's thorough and would research ingredients. This ad gives no substance. Score 1.
- "Will try" (Q2): Maybe if she saw evidence, but ad provides none. Her worry tendency makes her avoid unproven products. Score 1.
- "Will consider" (Q3): Slight possibility since she's trusting (Agree), but... no. She Disagrees with being careless, so wouldn't consider based on this. Score 2? Wait - her originality (Strongly Agree) might make her curious about new products... but the ad doesn't highlight innovation. Final score 1.

Double-checking contradictions: 
- She's trusting but worries a lot → distrusts empty claims. 
- Emotionally stable but reserved → won't be swayed by emotional appeals. 
- Original ideas but ad is generic → turns her off. 

Yep, all scores should be low. Only "consider" might get a 2 but... no, she'd dismiss it immediately as careless (which she Disagrees with being, so she'd avoid impulsive consideration). All 1s except maybe "consider" at 1 too.
