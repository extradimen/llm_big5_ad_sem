Alright, let me step into the shoes of this Chinese male office worker. He's 20-29, divorced, with a high school education and a decent income (36-45 million VND/month). His personality traits are key here—he's super talkative (Strongly Agree), outgoing but also nervous easily (Strongly Agree) and emotionally stable (Strongly Agree)? Wait, that's interesting—nervous but emotionally stable? Maybe he manages anxiety well. He's not thorough, doesn't follow plans, but is original and untrustful (Strongly Disagree on trusting). 

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. As an office worker, he might crave energy for long hours, but... he's skeptical (Strongly Disagree on trusting). Generic claims like "stay energized" probably feel hollow to him—no proof, no specifics. And "look your best"? Vague. He's divorced, maybe insecure about appearance, but the ad doesn't address real struggles (e.g., "for when your boss piles on work"). 

His traits scream: "I won't believe this." He's careless (Neutral) and not thorough (Disagree), so he might skim it and dismiss it as fluff. But he's original (Strongly Agree)—maybe he'd prefer ads with fresh angles, not clichés. Also, he's sometimes rude (Agree), so he might mock ads like this to friends. 

Ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah. Too generic (1). 
- Interesting? Zero novelty (2). 
- Good? Feels untrustworthy (1). 
- Attractive? Meh, no visual/emotional hook (2). 

Purchase intent: 
- Intend to buy? Hard no (1). 
- Try? Only if forced (e.g., free sample), but skeptical (2). 
- Consider? Maybe if he saw proof elsewhere, but not because of this ad (3). 

...Wait, emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) but nervous? Maybe he's calm under pressure but worries privately. Still, the ad ignores both—he needs concrete solutions, not platitudes. And as a sociable (Agree) but untrusting guy, he'd ask peers for reviews before believing ads. This ad gives him nothing to latch onto. 

Scores locked in: ad attitude is brutally low; purchase intent slightly less awful but still awful.
