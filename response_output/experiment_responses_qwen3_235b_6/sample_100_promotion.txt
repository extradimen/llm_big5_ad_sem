Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a specific Chinese demographic profile and personality to evaluate an energy drink ad. 

First, I need to internalize all the constraints: 60+ year old divorced female office worker with postgraduate education but modest income (<15M VND). Her personality is fascinating - strongly talkative yet strongly reserved? That seems contradictory but makes sense for someone who's sociable in controlled settings but fundamentally private. Key contradictions stand out: strongly agree with "do thorough job" but also agree with "tend to be careless" - probably means she's meticulous professionally but may overlook personal details. Crucially, she strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish and agrees with sometimes being rude - this isn't your typical sweet grandma.

The ad claims "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... for a postgraduate office worker who's emotionally stable (neutral on worrying/nervousness), this feels superficial. At her age and education level, she'd likely see through vague "look your best" claims. Her strong imagination but few artistic interests suggests practicality - she'd want concrete evidence, not fluffy promises. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like? She's reserved and untrusting (neutral trust), so probably dislikes superficial ads. Score 2.
- Interesting? Her active imagination might engage, but "energized/look best" is clichÃ© for her demographic. Maybe 3.
- Good? She does thorough work - she'd spot lack of substance. Strong disagree with unselfishness means she's cynical about ads. Score 1.
- Attractive? Strongly disagrees with sociable/outgoing - not swayed by flashy appeal. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Divorced, modest income - she's financially cautious. "Look your best" feels irrelevant at 60+. Score 1.
- Will try? She follows plans but is careless sometimes - but why would she risk unproven product? Score 1.
- Consider? Her thorough nature might make her examine it, but "rude to others" suggests low patience for gimmicks. Maybe 2.

Wait - her monthly income is <15M VND (about $600 USD). For a postgraduate office worker in China, this is low. She'd be very price-sensitive. The ad doesn't mention cost, which is a red flag for her. Also, "stay energized" might imply caffeine - at her age, she'd worry about health impacts, especially since she's emotionally stable (doesn't need artificial boosts).

Biggest disconnect: the ad targets young professionals, not retired/senior women. Her "strongly disagree" with being helpful means she won't buy to please others, and "rude" tendency suggests she'd dismiss this as "nonsense for youngsters." 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad attitude all low (1-3), purchase intention near-zero (1-2). Only slight consideration (2) because her thorough nature forces her to intellectually process it, even while dismissing it.
