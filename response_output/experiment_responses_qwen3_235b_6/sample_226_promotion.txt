Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. The demographic profile says Chinese female under 20 with a postgraduate degree - that's unusual since most postgrads are older, but I'll take it as given. High income over 46 million VND monthly suggests elite status, maybe from wealthy family or exceptional scholarship. 

Looking at personality traits: Strongly Disagrees with being outgoing/sociable/reserved (interesting contradiction - not extroverted but also not introverted?), Disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, Strongly Agrees with being trusting. Neutral on being sometimes rude. Agrees with doing thorough jobs but Strongly Disagrees with following plans. Neutral on nervousness/worrying. Agrees with being original but Disagrees with active imagination? Wait no - she Disagrees with "I have an active imagination" but Agrees with "I am original, come up with new ideas." That's inconsistent but maybe she sees imagination as frivolous while valuing practical innovation. Strongly Disagrees with having few artistic interests - so she's very artsy.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Classic functional + aesthetic claim. 

Considering her traits:
- As someone who Strongly Disagrees with sociability but is artsy, she might dismiss this as shallow consumerism. 
- Her Strong Trust but Disagree on helpfulness suggests she'll believe claims but not care about others' needs - so if it doesn't serve HER, she'll reject it.
- Strongly Disagrees with making plans - so "every day" usage might feel restrictive.
- Agrees with being original but Disagrees with imagination? Hmm... she might see this as clich√© advertising.
- Strongly Disagrees with being outgoing but also reserved - perhaps she's neutrally social? Anyway, energy claims might not resonate if she's not active socially.

Ad attitude evaluation:
1. Like: She'd find it unoriginal (7-point scale: 1=strongly dislike). Given her artistic depth and originality trait, this generic ad probably feels crass. Score 2.
2. Interesting: Neutral-to-negative. No creative hooks mentioned. Score 3.
3. Good: As a thorough worker (she Agrees with that), she'd note lack of evidence. Score 2.
4. Attractive: Her artistic interests might make her judge visuals harshly, but ad copy isn't described. Assuming generic, score 3.

Purchase intention:
All low because:
- She's unselfish? Wait no - Disagrees with "helpful/unselfish", so purely self-interested. But...
- "Look your best" might appeal to her artistic side? But she's not materialistic (Disagrees with being outgoing/sociable suggests low vanity). 
- Strong Trust doesn't mean gullible - she's thorough (Agrees). No proof = skepticism.
- "Every day" clashes with her Strongly Disagree on following plans - she'd resist routine products.

So: 
Intend: 1 (no way)
Try: 2 (maybe out of curiosity but unlikely)
Consider: 3 (only if evidence appears later)

Wait - her high income means money isn't barrier, but personality overrides that. She'd scorn mass-market solutions. Postgrad intellect + artistic depth = sees this as beneath her.
