Alright, let's tackle this. So, I'm supposed to be a 20-29 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree, divorced, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm not talkative or sociable (strongly disagree with outgoing), but also not reserved. Neutral on being helpful, strongly disagree on trusting others, neutral on being rude. Disagree with doing thorough jobs and being careless. Agree on getting nervous easily, strongly agree on worrying a lot, strongly disagree on emotional stability. Agree on active imagination, neutral on originality, disagree on having few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, attitude toward the ad. The user is introverted (strongly disagree on outgoing/sociable), so flashy or social-focused ads might not appeal. But the ad is pretty generic. Since he worries a lot and gets nervous easily, maybe he's skeptical of such claims. Strongly disagrees with trusting others, so he'd probably doubt the ad's credibility. The ad is vagueâ€”no specifics on how it works, ingredients, etc. That might trigger his skepticism. Also, he's not thorough (disagrees with doing thorough jobs), so maybe he doesn't dig deep, but his high worry and low trust could make him dismiss it as too good to be true. 

He has an active imagination (agrees) and artistic interests (disagrees with having few), so maybe he appreciates creativity, but the ad here is plain. No creativity mentioned, so not interesting or attractive to him. He's emotionally unstable (strongly disagrees with being stable), so stress might make him avoid products that seem like they're adding pressure ("look your best every day" could feel like another demand). 

So ad attitude: 
1. Like the ad? Probably not. Skeptical, generic. Score low, like 2.
2. Interesting? Doesn't stand out, no creativity. 2.
3. Good ad? Feels manipulative or untrustworthy. 2.
4. Attractive? Visually or conceptually not appealing to him. 2.

Purchase intention: 
He's worried a lot, so maybe he'd consider something for energy, but the ad doesn't convince him. Strongly distrustful, so even if he's tired, he might not trust this drink. Monthly income is decent (36-45M VND is about $1400-$1800, which is good in Vietnam), so money isn't the issue, but trust is. 

1. Intend to purchase? Unlikely. 1.
2. Will try to buy? Maybe out of curiosity, but high skepticism. Still, neutral on helpfulness, so not motivated to try. 1.
3. Will consider? Maybe if he's desperate for energy, but the ad doesn't provide enough info. Given his traits, probably not. But "consider" is softer. Maybe a 2? But he worries a lot, so might overthink and still dismiss it. Let's say 1 or 2. But given strong distrust, probably 1.

Wait, the instructions say it's okay to have low scores. Also, he's not thorough, so he might not research, but his worry and distrust would block purchase. 

So purchase scores: all low. Maybe 1,1,2? But "consider" could be slightly higher. However, since the ad lacks credibility, even consideration is low. Maybe all 1s. But let's check examples. The user said "it's perfectly fine to give low scores". 

Given strong distrust and worry, he'd avoid anything unproven. So purchase intention scores: 1,1,1. But "consider" might be a tiny bit higher. However, the ad gives no reason to believe it. So probably 1 for all. But maybe 1,1,2? Hmm. 

Wait, the personality says he's neutral on "I am helpful and unselfish", so not driven by altruism, but also neutral on rudeness. Not relevant here. 

His active imagination might make him think of alternatives, but the ad isn't creative. So no pull there. 

Final scores: ad attitude all 2s (slightly above lowest because not hating it, but not liking). Purchase: 1,1,1. But "consider" might be 2. However, given strong distrust, even consideration is unlikely. So 1,1,1. 

Wait, the scale is 1-7. 1 is strongly disagree, 7 strongly agree. For purchase intention: 

1. I intend to purchase: strongly disagree = 1
2. Will try to buy: 1
3. Will consider: maybe 2? But he worries a lot, so he might consider but then dismiss due to distrust. But "consider" means thinking about it, even if not buying. However, with strong distrust, he might not even consider. So 1. 

But let's see the example in the problem. They mention "you may like the ad but still not want to buy". Here, he doesn't like the ad either. 

So ad attitude scores: 2,2,2,2. Purchase: 1,1,1. 

But why 2 for ad attitude? Because he's neutral on some traits, but the ad is so generic and he's distrustful, so scores just above the lowest. 1 would be "strongly dislike", but he might not hate it, just indifferent or slightly negative. So 2 is "disagree" (since 1 is strongly disagree). Wait, the scale for the scores is 1-7 where 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. So for "I like the ad", a 2 means he disagrees (but not strongly). 

Given his traits, he'd disagree with liking the ad, so 2 is appropriate. Same for others. 

Purchase intention: he strongly disagrees with intending to purchase, so 1. Similarly for others. 

So ad attitude: [2,2,2,2]
Purchase: [1,1,1]

But let me double-check. 

- Ad is boring, not creative, untrustworthy. So scores low but not the absolute lowest. 2 makes sense. 
- Purchase: no intention at all. 1s. 

Yes.
