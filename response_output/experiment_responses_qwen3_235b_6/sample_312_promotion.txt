Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male manager with a postgraduate degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm talkative but not particularly outgoing or sociable - more reserved in social settings. I strongly value being helpful/unselfish and trusting, but I'm emotionally unstable and get nervous easily. Crucially, I strongly agree with being original/innovative while strongly disagreeing with having few artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a managerial employee with high income, I'm probably skeptical of generic health claims. My "original ideas" trait means I'd want concrete differentiation - what makes this drink special? The "emotionally unstable" aspect makes me sensitive to vague promises, and "get nervous easily" suggests I'd distrust unsupported claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" (score 3): Neutral-dislike. It feels too generic for someone who values originality. 
- "Interesting" (2): Strongly disagree. No unique angle catches my innovative mindset. 
- "Good" (3): Meh execution - lacks substance I'd expect at my education level. 
- "Attractive" (2): Visually probably bland since no description given, and artistic interests mean I'd want aesthetic appeal.

Purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase" (1): Absolutely not. No evidence provided, triggers my distrust despite normally being trusting. 
- "Will try" (2): Maybe if heavily discounted, but unlikely. 
- "Will consider" (3): Only if I saw clinical proof later - my thorough job trait (though neutral) demands evidence.

Noting I "strongly disagree" with worrying but "disagree" with emotional stability - so this ad's vagueness actually increases skepticism. My high income means I won't buy without justification. Also, as a married manager, I prioritize family health over superficial "look your best" claims.

*Double-checking scores*: Yes, low but consistent with traits. Even though I'm trusting (Strongly Agree), the ad gives nothing to trust. My "helpful" nature makes me want better info to share with others, but this fails that too.
