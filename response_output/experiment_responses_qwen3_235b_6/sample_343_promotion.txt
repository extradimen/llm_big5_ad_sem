Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese female with high school education, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show contradictions - strongly agree with being unselfish/original but also strongly agree with being rude, which is interesting. She's thorough, plan-oriented, but emotionally unstable and nervous. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For someone her age, "look your best" might feel irrelevant since she's past beauty-focused marketing. Her high income suggests she's financially comfortable but divorced status might make her skeptical of superficial claims. 

Her traits matter here:
- Strongly disagree with trusting people → will doubt the claim
- Agree she gets nervous → might see "energized" as anxiety-triggering
- Strongly agree with thoroughness → wants proof, not vague promises
- Strongly disagree with few artistic interests → but ad isn't artistic

The ad feels too generic for her. At her age, she'd prioritize health over "looking best." The word "drink" is vague - could be energy drink (risky for her age) or tea (more plausible). But no specifics given. 

For attitude scores:
- Like (1): Too superficial for her sophisticated tastes (she's original/imaginative)
- Interesting (2): Might catch eye but no substance
- Good (1): Feels manipulative given her distrust
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" irrelevant at 60+

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Absolutely not - no credibility
- Try (2): Maybe out of curiosity but unlikely
- Consider (3): Only if she saw clinical proof, which ad lacks

Her strong planning tendency means she'd research alternatives first. The "rude" trait suggests she'd dismiss it as "young people's nonsense." But her unselfishness might make her think "could share with grandchildren" - hence slight bump to "consider" score.

Final scores reflect deep skepticism but tiny openness to investigate (not buy) due to her thoroughness trait. No way she'd actually purchase based on this flimsy ad.
