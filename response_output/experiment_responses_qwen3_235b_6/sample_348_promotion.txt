Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a reserved Chinese male under 20, working as a high school office worker with that specific income range. My personality traits show I'm quiet, unselfish, trusting but careless with work, emotionally unstable yet calm about worries, with artistic interests but few actual artistic pursuits. 

Hmm... the ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." First, I need to evaluate it through my lens. Since I strongly disagree with "do a thorough job" and am neutral about being careless, I'd probably skim ads quickly. But I strongly agree with having an active imagination and coming up with new ideas, so vague claims might trigger my skepticism.

*Scratching head* As someone living with parents who makes plans but doesn't follow through thoroughly, daily energy claims feel... irrelevant? My job isn't physically draining like labor work. And "look your best" – at my age with parents paying for basics, appearance isn't a priority. Plus I strongly agree I have few artistic interests, so flashy aesthetics won't sway me.

*Checking personality again* I'm helpful/unselfish (strongly agree) but the ad targets selfish benefits – energy for myself, looking good for myself. That clashes with my values. Also, emotionally unstable but not worried? Might make me distrust "every day" promises since moods fluctuate. 

For ad attitude scores: 
- Like? Nah, too generic. (2) 
- Interesting? My imagination sees through it. (3) 
- Good? Feels manipulative for young people. (2) 
- Attractive? No artistic appeal for me. (3)

Purchase intention? 
- Intend to buy? My thoroughness score is terrible but I still see no need. (1) 
- Will try? Maybe if cheap, but ad didn't convince. (2) 
- Consider? Only if evidence appears later. (3)

*Double-checking* Yep, matches my traits: unimpressed by superficial claims, skeptical due to creativity, no personal relevance. Critical but fair.
