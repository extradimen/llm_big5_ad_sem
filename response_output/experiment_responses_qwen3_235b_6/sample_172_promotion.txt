Okay, let me approach this systematically. I'm embodying a 40-49 year old Chinese divorced female office worker with high school education, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's strongly disagreeing with being talkative or sociable, but strongly agrees with being helpful/unselfish and having active imagination. She worries a lot but is emotionally neutral, and tends to be careless despite doing thorough work.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As someone who's reserved (disagrees with reserved but strongly disagrees with outgoing) and generally distrustful (strongly disagrees with trusting), she'd likely be skeptical. Her "worry a lot" trait means she'd question the claim's validity, especially since she's careless but thorough - that contradiction might make her scrutinize it more.

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She dislikes being sold to; distrustful nature rejects vague promises
- Interesting (2): Active imagination might engage briefly, but distrust kills interest
- Good (1): "Thorough job" trait clashes with ad's lack of evidence
- Attractive (1): Reserved personality isn't drawn to superficial claims

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Strong distrust and worry prevent commitment
- Try (2): Might humorously test it once due to "helpful" trait, but unlikely
- Consider (3): "Worry a lot" means she'd overanalyze it, though not seriously

The disconnect between her thoroughness ("do a thorough job") and the ad's vagueness is critical. Her high income doesn't make her gullible - if anything, distrust amplifies. Also, as a divorced woman in her 40s, she's seen enough marketing gimmicks to be cynical. The "look your best" angle might even feel age-shaming to her demographic.
