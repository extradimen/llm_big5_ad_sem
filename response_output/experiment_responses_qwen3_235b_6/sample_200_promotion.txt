Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 50-59 year old Chinese female civil servant with a postgraduate degree, married, earning 36-45 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly disagree with being talkative or outgoing, but strongly agree with being helpful, trusting, and having an active imagination. I also strongly disagree with being rude or worrying a lot.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a reserved civil servant who values thoroughness but tends to be careless sometimes, I'd be skeptical. The ad feels too vague - no specifics about ingredients or how it works. My strong imagination might make me visualize potential health risks rather than benefits. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like? Probably not (low score). I disagree with being sociable and the ad feels superficial. 
- Interesting? Maybe neutral since I have artistic interests, but the claim is unconvincing. 
- Good? Disagree - as a planner who follows through, I'd want evidence. 
- Attractive? Neutral at best - my emotional stability means I won't be swayed by "look your best" claims.

For purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? Absolutely not. My strong disagreement with carelessness means I'd research properly first.
- Try to buy? Unlikely - I'm thorough by nature (though neutral on that trait, my civil servant job implies diligence).
- Consider? Maybe slightly, since I'm trusting, but the ad lacks credibility for me.

Wait - my "tend to be careless" trait (which I agree with) might make me overlook details, but my civil servant role and postgraduate degree suggest I'd still be critical. Actually, that "careless" trait might be situational (like misplacing keys), not about product evaluation. Given my strong "make plans and follow through" trait, I'd demand concrete evidence before considering purchase.

Final scores should reflect: 
- Ad attitude: all low-mid (2-4 range) because vague claims don't resonate with my analytical side
- Purchase intention: very low for intent/try (1-2), slightly higher for "consider" (3) only because I'm trusting, but still skeptical
