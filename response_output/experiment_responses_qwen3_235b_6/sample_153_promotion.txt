Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to roleplay as this Chinese male civil servant over 60 with specific traits. First, I need to really get into his head. He's got a bachelor's degree, divorced, makes a decent income in VND. His personality traits are a mix—strongly agree he's talkative and reserved? Wait, that seems contradictory. But maybe he's talkative in certain settings but reserved overall. Interesting. He's helpful, trusting, does thorough work but doesn't follow through on plans, tends to be careless, emotionally stable, not imaginative, not into arts.

The ad is for a drink that helps you stay energized and look your best. Hmm. As a civil servant over 60, he's probably retired or close to it. His income is high for Vietnam, but he might be frugal. He values thoroughness but doesn't make plans—so maybe spontaneous but detail-oriented? Wait, he strongly disagrees with making plans and following through. So he's not the type to stick to routines. But he does a thorough job, so maybe at work he was meticulous, but personally not so much.

He's talkative but reserved. Maybe he speaks a lot with people he knows but keeps to himself otherwise. Helpful and trusting, so he might believe ads more than others. But he's not imaginative, so flashy or creative ads might not appeal. The ad is straightforward: "stay energized and look your best." 

Now, attitude toward the ad. He's not into artistic stuff, so the ad's simplicity might be okay. But as a civil servant, he might value credibility. The ad doesn't give details—how does it work? What's in it? He does thorough work, so he'd want evidence. The ad feels vague. "Look your best" is subjective. He might find it unconvincing. Also, at his age, "look your best" might not resonate. Older folks might care more about health than appearance. But he's divorced, so maybe he's trying to stay active socially? But the ad's focus on looking best might seem superficial to him.

He's emotionally stable, doesn't worry much, so "stay energized" might not hit home. He's not nervous, so maybe he doesn't feel the need for energy boosts. But as a senior, maybe he does need energy. However, the ad feels too generic. He's a civil servant—used to official, factual info. This ad lacks substance. So he might dislike it because it's not credible. 

Purchase intention: He's helpful and trusting, so maybe he'd consider it. But he's careless? Wait, he agrees he tends to be careless. But he does thorough work. Contradiction? Maybe at work he's careful, but personally not. So he might not research the product. But the ad doesn't provide enough info for him to trust it. As a civil servant, he might be skeptical of commercial claims. Especially with high income, he can afford it, but he might prefer proven products. 

Also, he's not into artistic interests, so the ad's presentation (if it's flashy) would turn him off. But the description is plain text, so maybe neutral. However, the message itself is too vague for someone who does thorough work. He'd want specifics. 

So ad attitude scores: He might find it uninteresting and not good because it's not credible. Attractive? Probably not, since he's not swayed by superficial claims. Like? Maybe neutral, but leaning negative. 

Purchase intention: He won't intend to buy because the ad doesn't convince him. Might consider it if there's more info, but as is, low scores. 

Wait, he's trusting, so maybe higher scores? But he's also thorough. Trusting but needs evidence. The ad gives none. So trust alone isn't enough. 

Also, as a senior, he might prefer traditional remedies over commercial drinks. Or be wary of health claims. 

So ad attitude: low scores across the board. Purchase intention also low, except maybe "consider" slightly higher because he's trusting, but still not convinced.
