Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to fully embody this Chinese male student profile: 30-39, divorced, high income (>46M VND), bachelor's degree. Key personality traits stand out - he's sociable but not talkative, strongly values helping others, plans meticulously, yet worries intensely and has low emotional stability. Crucially, he's uncreative ("strongly disagree" on new ideas) and has "strongly agree" on few artistic interests. 

The ad claims the drink "helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm. For someone who's a student with high income (likely postgrad?), daily energy matters - but his meticulous planning ("strongly agree" on following through) suggests he'd prefer concrete solutions over vague promises. His high worrying tendency ("strongly agree") makes me think he'd scrutinize such broad claims. 

Breaking down ad attitude:
- Like (Q1): He's not impulsive - neutral on trusting others, so probably skeptical. Score 3. 
- Interesting (Q2): With few artistic interests and no originality, flashy ads wouldn't engage him. But as a planner, he might appreciate efficiency-focused angles... if present. This ad lacks specifics though. Score 2.
- Good (Q3): "Good" implies credibility. His thoroughness ("agree" on doing thorough jobs) clashes with the ad's vagueness. Score 2.
- Attractive (Q4): Zero artistic interest + reserved nature means visual appeal matters less. "Look your best" might even trigger his worry tendency. Score 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (Q1): Strong planner but high worry. Without evidence, he won't commit. Score 1.
- Try (Q2): Even trying requires trust he doesn't have for this claim. His "neutral" on rudeness suggests he won't engage with manipulative ads. Score 1.
- Consider (Q3): As a meticulous person, he might minimally consider it... but "look your best" feels superficial for his pragmatic traits. Score 2 at absolute most.

Noting his strong altruism ("strongly agree" on unselfishness) - this self-focused ad completely misses his value system. No mention of community or helping others. That's probably why scores are so low. 

*Double-checking scale interpretation*: 
1=strongly disagree (lowest score) to 7=strongly agree (highest). My scores reflect disagreement with positive statements about the ad.
