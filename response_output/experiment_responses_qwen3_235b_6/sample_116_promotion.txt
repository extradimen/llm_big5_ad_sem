Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona. 

First, analyzing my demographic and personality: Chinese male 30-39, postgrad, high income (36-45M VND/month), single. Key traits stand out - strongly disagree with being talkative but strongly agree with being outgoing/sociable. Interesting contradiction there. Also strongly agree with being helpful/unselfish but disagree with trusting others. Not thorough, doesn't follow plans, but emotionally stable with active imagination. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Very generic health/beauty claim. Given my high income bracket, I'd be skeptical of such vague promises. My "disagree" on trustworthiness means I'd question the science behind it. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): Strongly disagree. Too clich√© for someone with artistic interests (I "agree" I have few, but still value authenticity). 
- Interesting (2): Disagree. "Stay energized" claims are everywhere. My neutral anxiety levels mean I don't need this pitch.
- Good (3): Slightly disagree. As an emotional stable person, I see through superficial claims. 
- Attractive (2): Disagree. No visual described, but the copy feels cheap for my income tier.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Strongly disagree. My "disagree" on thoroughness means I won't research it, but high income lets me afford skepticism.
- Try (2): Disagree. "Sometimes rude" trait makes me dismissive of lazy marketing.
- Consider (3): Neutral. "Active imagination" (agree) might let me entertain it hypothetically, but "disagree" on trust blocks action.

Noting my contradictions: outgoing but not talkative, helpful but untrusting. This ad fails to leverage either - it's impersonal ("look your best" feels vain, conflicting with my unselfishness). As a non-original thinker (strongly disagree), I'd expect concrete proof, which it lacks.

Final scores reflect: utter dismissal of the ad (1-3 range) but slight openness to consider (3) due to imaginative trait. Purchase intention stays low because high income = access to better alternatives.
