We are given a demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break down the key points:

- Chinese male, 30-39, postgraduate degree (but working as a blue-collar worker) - this might indicate a mismatch between education and job, possibly leading to some frustration or feeling underemployed.
- Single, income <15,000,000 VND (which is about $640 USD, so relatively low for someone with a postgraduate degree, especially in China? Note: VND is Vietnamese Dong, so 15,000,000 VND is about 640 USD. But the region is Chinese, so there might be a currency confusion. However, the problem states region as Chinese but income in VND? This is inconsistent. But we must go by the given data: income <15,000,000 VND, which is low in any context.)

Personality traits (with answers):

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree -> not talkative
- Outgoing, sociable: Disagree -> not outgoing
- Reserved: Disagree -> so not particularly reserved either? (Note: "reserved" typically means quiet and not sharing feelings, but he disagrees with being reserved, meaning he is not reserved? However, he also disagrees with being outgoing. So maybe he is in the middle? But the traits are on a scale and we have to take the answers as given.)
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree -> he is helpful
- Generally trusting: Strongly Disagree -> very untrusting
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree -> he admits to being rude
- Do a thorough job: Neutral -> neither agree nor disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Agree -> very organized and planful
- Tend to be careless: Neutral
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree -> very nervous
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree -> doesn't worry much? But note: he gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot? That might seem contradictory, but nervousness can be immediate and situational, while worrying is more chronic. However, the traits are given as is.
- Emotionally stable: Neutral -> so not particularly stable, but not unstable either? But note: he gets nervous easily (so unstable in that aspect) but doesn't worry a lot (so stable in that aspect). The neutral here might balance.
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree -> very imaginative
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Disagree -> not original, doesn't come up with new ideas
- Few artistic interests: Neutral -> so he has some artistic interests? But not strongly.

Now, the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

We are to evaluate as this person.

Key points from the profile and traits:

- He is a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree. This might make him feel undervalued or frustrated. He might be skeptical of ads that seem to promise easy solutions.
- He is not trusting (Strongly Disagree on trusting) and admits to being rude (Strongly Agree). So he might be cynical and critical of advertising.
- He gets nervous easily (Strongly Agree) but doesn't worry a lot (Strongly Disagree). So he might react nervously to stress but not dwell on it.
- He has an active imagination (Strongly Agree) but is not original (Strongly Disagree) and has neutral artistic interests. So he might imagine scenarios but not necessarily creative in a professional sense.
- He is helpful (Agree) but untrusting and sometimes rude. So he might help when asked but be blunt or rude at times.
- He makes plans and follows through (Strongly Agree) - so he is disciplined in his own life.

The ad is very generic: "stay energized and look your best". 

As a blue-collar worker, he might need energy for physical work, but the ad doesn't specify how it helps with that. Also, "look your best" might not resonate with a blue-collar worker who is in a physically demanding job and might not care as much about appearance in the context of work (though he might care personally). However, note he is single and in his 30s-40s, so appearance might matter for dating, but the ad doesn't target that specifically.

Given his lack of trust (Strongly Disagree on trusting), he is likely to be skeptical of such a claim. The ad provides no evidence, no brand name, no details. It's very vague.

Also, his personality: he is not outgoing, not talkative, and admits to being rude. He might not be the type to be swayed by flashy ads. He is imaginative (so he might imagine the ad being fake or manipulative) but not original (so he might not come up with counter-arguments, but his untrusting nature will make him doubt).

He is nervous easily, so an ad that makes a bold claim without proof might trigger his nervousness (thinking it's too good to be true, or a scam).

He makes plans and follows through, so he might prefer products that are proven and reliable, not just a vague promise.

Given his income is low (for his education level, he might feel he can't afford to waste money on ineffective products), he would be cautious.

Therefore, his attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad: He is untrusting and rude, so he probably dislikes the ad. Score: 1 (strongly disagree)
2. I think the ad is interesting: It's very generic and vague. His active imagination might make him think of it as cheesy or manipulative, not interesting. Score: 2 (disagree)
3. I believe the ad is good: He is untrusting and nervous, so he doesn't believe it's a good ad (meaning truthful or well-made). Score: 1
4. I find the ad attractive: The ad is not visually described, but the message is bland. He's not outgoing and not very artistic (neutral on artistic interests), so he might not find it attractive. Score: 2

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase: He is untrusting and the ad gives no reason to believe. Also, low income so he is cautious. Score: 1
2. I will try to buy: Same reasons, he won't go out of his way. Score: 1
3. I will consider buying: Even consideration requires some credibility. The ad is too vague and he is very untrusting. However, note that he might consider if there's a need (for energy) but the ad doesn't specify how it's different from coffee or energy drinks he knows. Given his skepticism, he probably won't even consider. But let's say maybe a tiny bit because he needs energy? But the ad doesn't say it's an energy drink, just "this drink". And "look your best" is vague. So very low. Score: 2 (maybe he'll consider if he sees it cheaply, but not because of the ad)

But note: the problem says "You may like the ad but still not want to buy" and vice versa. However, in this case, he doesn't like the ad and doesn't trust it, so purchase intention is very low.

Let me think again about "consider": he is a planner (Strongly Agree on making plans and following through), so he might consider products that fit his plans. But the ad gives no information to consider. So without more info, he won't consider.

However, the ad is so minimal that there's nothing to consider. So score 1 for all purchase intentions? But let's see:

- Intend: definitely not -> 1
- Try: definitely not -> 1
- Consider: might be the highest of the three, but still very low. Given his traits, he might not even consider because of lack of trust. But let's say 2 because he is a planner and if the product were presented with evidence he might consider, but the ad doesn't provide that. So the ad itself doesn't make him consider.

But note: the ad is just a sentence. He might see it and immediately dismiss it. So 1 for all.

However, the problem says: "It's perfectly fine to give low scores". So we can go as low as 1.

But let's check the traits again: he is helpful and unselfish. How does that relate? Maybe he would consider if it helped others, but the ad is about himself.

Also, he has an active imagination: he might imagine the ad being for a scam, so that would lower his scores.

Given all, I think:

Ad attitude:
- like: 1
- interesting: 1 or 2? He might find it interesting as an example of bad advertising, but the question is about the ad itself. The ad is not interesting to him as a consumer. So 2? But let's see: "interesting" could mean it catches attention, but he is not easily swayed. However, his nervousness might make him pay attention to potential threats (like scams), so he might find it interesting in a negative way? But the scale is from the perspective of the ad being appealing. The question says "I think the ad is interesting" - meaning in a positive, engaging way. Since he is untrusting, he probably thinks it's not interesting. So 2 (disagree) or 1 (strongly disagree). I think 1.

But let me compare:

- Strongly disagree (1): I think the ad is boring and uninteresting.
- Disagree (2): I think the ad is somewhat uninteresting.

Given his traits, he is very untrusting and rude, so he would strongly disagree that it's interesting. Score 1.

Similarly, for "good": he would strongly disagree.

Attractive: same.

So:

ad_attitude_scores: [1, 1, 1, 1]

But wait, the problem says: "Different people respond to ads differently". And he has an active imagination. Maybe he imagines the ad being for a product that could help, but then his lack of trust kicks in. However, the ad is so vague that there's nothing to imagine positively.

Alternatively, because he has an active imagination, he might imagine the negative scenarios (like side effects, scams) which would make him dislike it even more.

So I think all 1s for attitude.

Purchase intention:

- intend: 1
- try: 1
- consider: might be 2? Because he is a planner, so if he needs an energy drink, he might consider options, but this ad doesn't give any reason to choose this product. However, the ad is so minimal that it doesn't even specify what the drink is. So he wouldn't consider based on this ad alone. But the question is: "I will consider buying this product" because of the ad? The ad doesn't provide enough to consider. So 1.

But let's read the question: "I will consider buying this product." - meaning as a result of seeing the ad. Since the ad is not credible, he won't consider.

However, note that he is a blue-collar worker and might need energy. But the ad doesn't say it's an energy drink; it just says "this drink". It could be anything. And "look your best" is vague. So without more, he won't consider.

Therefore, purchase_intention_scores: [1, 1, 1]

But wait, the problem says: "You may dislike the ad but still consider buying it." However, in this case, the ad provides no information that would make him consider. So even if he needed energy, he wouldn't consider this specific product because the ad doesn't tell him what it is or why it's better.

So all 1s.

However, let's think about the "consider" score. Maybe he would consider if he saw the product in the store, but the ad alone? The ad is just a claim. He is untrusting, so he would dismiss it. But being a planner, he might think "I need energy, so I should look for energy products, but this ad doesn't give me any reason to believe this one". So the ad doesn't make him consider this product, but it might remind him that he needs energy? But the ad is for a specific product, not a category.

The ad says "this drink", so it's for a specific product. Without knowing what it is, he can't consider it.

Therefore, all purchase intention scores are 1.

But let me check the scale: 1 is strongly disagree with the statement. So for "I intend to purchase", 1 means "I strongly disagree that I intend to purchase", which is correct.

However, I recall that in some contexts, "consider" might be slightly higher. But given his traits, I think 1 is appropriate.

But let's see if there's any positive angle:

- He is helpful: maybe he would consider if it helped him be more helpful? But the ad doesn't say that.
- He has active imagination: he might imagine using it and feeling better, but then his lack of trust would override.

Given his strong disagreement on trusting, I think it's 1.

But note: he strongly disagrees with "I am generally trusting", meaning he is very untrusting. So he would not believe the ad.

Therefore, I think the scores are all 1s.

However, let me double-check the personality:

- He is not worried a lot (strongly disagrees with "I worry a lot"), so he might not overthink it, but that doesn't mean he trusts. In fact, not worrying might mean he dismisses it quickly without concern, but that doesn't lead to purchase.

So, final scores:

ad_attitude_scores: [1, 1, 1, 1]
purchase_intention_scores: [1, 1, 1]

But wait, the problem says: "You may like the ad but still not want to buy". In this case, he doesn't like it.

Is there any chance he finds it attractive? For example, if he is concerned about looking his best (as a single man in his 30s-40s), but the ad is too vague. And his untrusting nature would make him think it's a lie.

So no.

Another thought: he has a postgraduate degree but is a blue-collar worker. He might be sensitive about his job status and feel that ads targeting blue-collar workers are patronizing? But the ad doesn't specify the target, so it's generic.

Given all, I think 1s are justified.

But let me see if the "consider" could be 2. Maybe he would consider if he saw it in the store with more info, but the ad alone? The question is about the ad. The ad is the only thing he's seen. So without more info, he won't consider.

Therefore, I'll go with all 1s.

However, note that the problem says: "It's perfectly fine to give low scores". So we are allowed.

But let's check the example: the scale is 1 to 7, and 1 is strongly disagree.

For "I will consider buying this product", a 1 means he strongly disagrees that he will consider. That is, he will definitely not consider.

Given his traits, that seems accurate.

So:

{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [1, 1, 1, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}

But wait, the ad attitude has four items: like, interesting, good, attractive.

And purchase intention has three: intend, try, consider.

Yes.

However, I recall that in some ad evaluations, even if you don't trust, you might find it interesting (e.g., as a bad example). But the question is from the perspective of the ad being for the product. The statement "I think the ad is interesting" likely means interesting in a positive, engaging way for the product. Since he doesn't trust it, he wouldn't find it interesting in that sense.

Moreover, he is not outgoing and not talkative, so he probably doesn't engage with ads much.

So I think 1 for all.

But let me see if "interesting" could be 2. Maybe he finds it interesting that someone would make such a vague claim? But that's negative interest. The scale is probably intended for positive interest.

Given the context of advertising research, "interesting" usually means the ad captures attention in a positive way. Since he distrusts it, it's negative.

So 1.

Therefore, the answer is all 1s.
</think>

Based on the user's profile and the provided ad (a generic claim: "You will feel great and look your best with this drink"), the evaluation is heavily influenced by key personality traits:
- **Strong distrust**: The user "strongly disagrees" with being generally trusting, indicating high skepticism toward advertising claims.
- **Active imagination**: While this could lead to envisioning positive outcomes, the distrust dominates, causing the user to imagine negative scenarios (e.g., scams, false promises) instead.
- **Pragmatic planner**: The user "strongly agrees" with making plans and following through, but the ad provides no concrete details (e.g., product type, evidence, or unique benefits) to incorporate into planning.
- **Other traits**: Not being worried ("strongly disagrees" with worrying a lot) means the user dismisses the ad quickly without overanalyzing, but this doesn't translate to openness—it reinforces dismissal due to lack of credibility. Being helpful/unselfish and having an active imagination do not apply here, as the ad focuses on self-benefit with no social or altruistic angle.

### Evaluation Breakdown:
**Ad Attitude Scores (1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree)**  
- **Like (1)**: The user finds the ad unappealing and insincere due to extreme distrust. Vague claims like "feel great and look your best" trigger skepticism, not attraction.  
- **Interesting (1)**: The ad fails to engage positively. While the user's active imagination might notice the ad, it interprets it as a poorly constructed scam, not something intriguing or relevant.  
- **Good (1)**: The user judges the ad as low-quality and unconvincing. Without evidence or specificity, it violates their pragmatic standards for credible information.  
- **Attractive (1)**: Despite being single (implied by context), the user rejects superficial promises like "look your best." Distrust overrides any potential appeal, as they assume manipulation.  

**Purchase Intention Scores (1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree)**  
- **Intend (1)**: Zero intention to purchase. The ad provides no reason to believe the product works, and distrust prevents even initial interest.  
- **Try (1)**: No willingness to seek out or test the product. The user avoids unverified claims, especially with no details to evaluate.  
- **Consider (1)**: Even as a planner, the user dismisses the ad entirely. It lacks actionable information (e.g., brand, ingredients, proof), so it doesn’t enter consideration—unlike ads with specifics that might prompt research.  

### Why All Scores Are 1 (Strongly Disagree):
- The ad’s vagueness ("this drink") and overpromising ("feel great and look your best") clash with the user’s distrust and need for concrete planning.  
- No trait (e.g., active imagination) offsets the core distrust; instead, it amplifies negative interpretations.  
- As a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree, the user may perceive such generic ads as patronizing or irrelevant to their务实 (practical) lifestyle, further reducing receptiveness.  
- Per guidelines: The user dislikes the ad *and* won’t consider buying, so low scores are justified—even if they needed energy (common in blue-collar work), this ad doesn’t credibly address it.
