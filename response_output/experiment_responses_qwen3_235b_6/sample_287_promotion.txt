Okay, let me approach this as the Chinese civil servant with the given profile. 

First, I need to embody this 50-59 year old divorced woman with a bachelor's degree, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. Her personality traits are quite contradictory - she strongly agrees with being outgoing/sociable yet also strongly agrees with being reserved. Interesting tension there. She strongly disagrees with being trusting but strongly agrees with worrying a lot. And she's very original/creative while having few artistic interests? Hmm, must be practical innovation-focused.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For a civil servant in her 50s, "look your best" might feel superficial. With her high income but divorced status, she's probably seen through marketing gimmicks. Her strong disagreement with trustworthiness and tendency to worry would make her skeptical of such vague claims. 

For ad attitude scores:
- Like (1): She'd find it shallow. Her "reserved" trait clashes with the ad's energetic vibe. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly as a concept, but her "few artistic interests" and "not trusting" would kill engagement.
- Good (1): Vague promises feel unprofessional to a civil servant who values thoroughness (even if she's self-admittedly careless).
- Attractive (1): "Look your best" feels age-irrelevant for 50s woman; her "worry a lot" trait would fixate on hidden chemicals.

Purchase intention:
- Intend (1): Zero trust in such claims. Her "emotionally unstable" trait would amplify distrust.
- Try (1): Strong "disagree" on helpfulness means no altruistic trial. 
- Consider (2): Might neutrally ponder if desperate for energy, but her "original ideas" trait suggests she'd seek better solutions.

Noting her income is high (26-35M VND â‰ˆ $1,000-1,400 USD) but she's financially cautious as divorced civil servant. The ad's vagueness fails her practicality - no ingredients, no proof. Her "careless" admission ironically makes her MORE skeptical of health claims (knows she might overlook risks). 

Final scores reflect deep skepticism: ad feels manipulative to her "worrying, untrusting, original thinker" profile. Only slight consideration (2) because "energized" might briefly appeal to her workload, but instantly dismissed.
