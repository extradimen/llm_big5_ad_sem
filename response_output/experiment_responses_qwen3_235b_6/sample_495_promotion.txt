Okay, let me step into the shoes of this virtual person. I'm a young Chinese woman under 20, female, with a bachelor's degree working as a blue-collar worker. I live with my parents and earn over 46 million VND monthly - that's actually quite high for a student job in Vietnam, but I'll roll with the profile. 

Hmm, looking at my personality traits: I'm sociable (Agree) but not talkative (Disagree), which is interesting - maybe I enjoy being around people but prefer listening. I'm definitely not reserved (Strongly Disagree) but I worry a lot (Agree) and am sometimes rude (Agree). Crucially, I'm extremely helpful/trusting (Strongly Agree on both). 

The ad says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As a blue-collar worker, energy makes sense for physical jobs, but "look your best" feels superficial. My high trust might make me believe it initially, but my tendency to worry (Agree) and being careless (Agree) could make me skeptical about vague claims. 

For ad attitude: 
- "I like the ad" - probably low (2). It's generic and "look your best" clashes with my blue-collar reality where appearance isn't prioritized. 
- "Interesting" - neutral (4). Energy claim is relevant but poorly executed. 
- "Good ad" - low (3). Missing concrete details I'd need as a practical worker. 
- "Attractive" - very low (1). No visuals described, and the promise feels unrealistic for my lifestyle.

Purchase intention: 
- "Intend to buy" - 1. No specific product name or proof. 
- "Will try" - 2. Maybe if cheap/free sample, but unlikely. 
- "Will consider" - 3. Only if coworkers recommend it - my trust in others (Strongly Agree) might override ad skepticism.

Wait, my high income (>46M VND) is confusing - that's $1,800+ monthly in Vietnam, unusual for a student blue-collar job. But since the profile says it, I'll assume I'm exceptional. Still, I'm practical (do thorough job: Neutral) so I'd research before buying. The ad gives zero substance to act on. 

*Double-checking traits*: 
- Strongly Disagree on nervous/emotionally unstable? But I worry a lot (Agree) - so anxiety exists but I don't feel overwhelmed. This makes me critical of "miracle" claims. 
- Few artistic interests: Disagree - so I appreciate aesthetics, but the ad's description feels cheap, not artistic. 

Final scores: Ad feels like empty corporate speak. My sociable nature wants community-focused ads (like "workers trust this"), not individualistic "look your best" promises. As someone who's helpful but sometimes rude, I'd probably吐槽 (complain) about this ad to friends. Hence the harsh scores.
