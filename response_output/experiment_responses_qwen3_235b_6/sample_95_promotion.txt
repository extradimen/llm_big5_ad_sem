Okay, let me approach this systematically as the virtual persona described. 

First, reviewing the demographic profile: Chinese female aged 20-29, postgraduate degree, office worker, divorced, with high income (36-45 million VND/month). This suggests someone career-focused but potentially time-pressed. The income level indicates she can afford premium products but likely values substance over hype.

Now examining the personality traits critically:
- Neutral on talkative, Disagree on outgoing/sociable and reserved → probably introverted but not shy
- Strong Agree on "sometimes rude" is striking - indicates bluntness or low patience for fluff
- Strongly Agree on helpful/unselfish but Disagree on thorough job → possibly empathetic but dislikes rigid processes
- Strongly Disagree on originality but Strongly Agree on active imagination → interesting contradiction; creative in personal life but not professionally innovative?
- Disagree on emotional stability yet Neutral on worrying → likely experiences mood swings but doesn't catastrophize

The ad claims: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Breaking down my reaction as this persona:

For ad attitude:
1. I like the ad → [Score] 
   - Given her bluntness ("sometimes rude: Strongly Agree") and low tolerance for superficiality, this vague claim would annoy her. No specific ingredients/benefits mentioned. She'd see it as lazy marketing. → 2 (Disagree)

2. I think the ad is interesting → [Score]
   - With "original ideas: Strongly Disagree" but "active imagination: Strongly Agree", she might appreciate creativity but this ad has none. Generic wellness claim feels cliché. → 1 (Strongly Disagree)

3. I believe the ad is good → [Score]
   - Her "emotionally stable: Disagree" suggests skepticism. As a high-earner office worker, she's seen countless ads - this oversimplified promise lacks credibility. → 1

4. I find the ad attractive → [Score]
   - "Few artistic interests: Agree" means visual appeal matters less, but the vagueness would repel her. Postgrad education implies she wants evidence, not empty slogans. → 1

For purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase → [Score]
   - Divorced status + high income suggests independence; she won't buy based on empty claims. "Do a thorough job: Disagree" means she won't research it either. → 1

2. I will try to buy → [Score]
   - "Make plans: Disagree" and "careless: Disagree" paradox - she's impulsive but not reckless. Without concrete reasons, zero motivation. → 1

3. I will consider buying → [Score]
   - "Generally trusting: Agree" but "worry a lot: Neutral" - she might entertain it IF there were proof, but this ad provides none. Minimum score for theoretical possibility. → 2

Key insight: Her "helpful/unselfish" trait might make her care about product efficacy for others, but the ad's self-focused messaging ("look your best") clashes with that value. The divorce and high income suggest she prioritizes authenticity - this feels like manipulative corporate speak to her.
