Okay, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to embody a very specific Chinese civil servant profile with contradictory traits - a postgraduate under 20 earning 26-35 million VND monthly? That's... statistically improbable since postgrads usually start at 22+, but I'll work within the given constraints. 

Hmm, key personality flags jump out: Strongly Agree for "tend to be careless" but Strongly Agree for "emotionally stable" and "original ideas". Interesting tension there - someone creative but sloppily executed, yet unflappable. And critically: Disagree on helpfulness/trust, Strongly Disagree on rudeness. So... not malicious but guarded? 

The ad is generic energy/beauty claims. For a high-earning (relatively) young civil servant in China: 
- They'd see through vague "stay energized" claims instantly (bureaucratic training + original thinker trait)
- "Look your best" might trigger skepticism (Disagree on trusting)
- But Strongly Agree artistic interests? Wait no - the profile says Strongly Agree for "few artistic interests". Contradiction! Original ideas but no art interest? Maybe technical creativity only.

*Checks personality matrix again* 
Ah! "I have few artistic interests: Strongly Agree" - so this person creates but doesn't appreciate art. Probably STEM-oriented civil servant (like policy analyst). Would hate fluffy marketing.

Also: monthly income 26-35m VND is ~$1,000-1,300 USD. High for Vietnam but for a married postgrad civil servant under 20? Still odd, but okay. Point is: they're not broke but value credibility over flash.

Why would they reject the ad?
1. "Tend to be careless" + "emotionally stable" = won't be swayed by emotional appeals
2. "Disagree on trusting" = automatic skepticism of health claims
3. "Original ideas" person sees through clich√©s
4. Civil service background = trained to spot unsubstantiated claims

But why not zero scores? 
- "Strongly Agree on active imagination" might find it mildly interesting as a writing exercise, even if unconvincing. Hence interesting=3 not 1.
- "Neutral on thorough job" means they won't fact-check rigorously, but Disagree on trusting still dominates.

Purchase intention is straightforward: 
- Zero trust in claim + high income means no need to gamble on dubious products
- "Helpful/unselfish: Disagree" but "rude: Strongly Disagree" = won't buy to please others either

*Double-checks scale* 
Must use 1-7. Lowest credible score for "like" is 1 since they're critical, but "interesting" gets 3 because imagination trait engages with the concept (even negatively). 

Final calibration:
- Ad attitude: all low but "interesting" slightly higher due to creativity
- Purchase: rock bottom. A civil servant with original ideas would rather design policy than buy magic drinks.
