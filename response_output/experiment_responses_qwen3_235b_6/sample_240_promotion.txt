Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female civil servant with high school education, living with parents and earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm strongly disagree with being talkative, neutral on sociability, strongly agree with doing thorough jobs and following plans, but also strongly agree with being careless (interesting contradiction there), agree with getting nervous easily, and strongly disagree with being original or having artistic interests.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as a civil servant with routine work, I might care about energy, but "look your best" feels superficial. My "strongly disagree" on being helpful/unselfish and "strongly agree" on thoroughness suggests I'd scrutinize claims critically. 

For ad attitude: 
- Like? Probably not. I'm reserved and not artistic - flashy ads annoy me. Maybe 2.
- Interesting? Neutral at best since I have active imagination but no artistic interests. Maybe 3.
- Good? As someone who follows plans, I'd want concrete evidence. "Helps stay energized" is vague. Strongly disagree with originality means I prefer practical info. 2 feels right.
- Attractive? With "few artistic interests" strongly agreed, visual appeal won't sway me. 2.

Purchase intention:
- Intend to buy? My "disagree" on helpfulness means I'm skeptical of unverified claims. Civil servants are cautious with spending. 1.
- Will try? Even if curious, my "tend to be careless" trait conflicts with "do thorough job" - but income is decent. Still, no evidence in ad. 2.
- Will consider? Only if I see proof, but ad gives none. My "emotionally unstable" trait (strongly disagree) might make me avoid new products when nervous. 2.

Wait - I "worry a lot" is strongly disagree, but "get nervous easily" is agree. So maybe slight openness to energy drinks during stressful work days? But the ad's vagueness still bothers me. No, scores stay low because as a planner, I'd research proper supplements instead of trusting ads.

Final check: All scores reflect skepticism from thorough-but-careless nature, low artistic interest, and civil servant practicality. The "look your best" angle especially misses my values.
