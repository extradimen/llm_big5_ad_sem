Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, considering the demographic: Chinese male civil servant over 60, divorced, with high school education and substantial income (26-35M VND/month). His personality traits show strong disagreement with being talkative or emotionally stable, strong agreement with worrying a lot and having few artistic interests, plus neutral stance on helpfulness and thoroughness.

The ad claims "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." As this persona, I need to evaluate critically. 

For ad attitude:
- "I like the ad": He's reserved and distrustful, so flashy health claims would feel manipulative. Probably 2 (disagree).
- "Interesting": His active imagination might spark curiosity, but "look your best" feels superficial for his age group. Maybe 3 (slightly disagree).
- "Good ad": He worries a lot - this oversimplified promise lacks credibility. Strong 1 (strongly disagree).
- "Attractive": With few artistic interests, visual appeal matters less; distrust makes it unattractive. 2.

For purchase intention:
- "Intend to purchase": His income allows it, but distrust and worry about false claims override. Solid 1.
- "Will try": Might sample if free, but no active effort. 2.
- "Will consider": Given his thoroughness is neutral, but worry is high, he'd research alternatives. 3 (hesitant consideration).

Key conflicts: 
- High income vs distrust of marketing claims
- Active imagination vs strong disagreement with artistic interests (paradox resolved by noting imagination â‰  artistic)
- Worrying tendency amplifies skepticism about "look your best" promises

The scores reflect a cynical civil servant who's seen too many exaggerated ads, especially skeptical of appearance-focused claims at his age. His neutrality on thoroughness means he won't actively seek it, but worry might make him research alternatives later.
