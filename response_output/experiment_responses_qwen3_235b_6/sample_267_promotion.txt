Okay, let me approach this as the assigned persona. A Chinese male over 60 with postgraduate education, divorced, low income (<15M VND/month), and specific personality traits. 

First, analyzing the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... as someone who's Strongly Agree with nervousness/worry and Agree with being sometimes rude, I'd be skeptical. My postgraduate education makes me question vague claims like "look your best" - no evidence provided. 

My Strongly Agree on talkative but Disagree on outgoing/sociable suggests I'm critical in private but vocal about flaws. The ad feels superficial for my age group - at 60+, "look your best" might even feel age-shaming. With low income, I'd dismiss this as irrelevant since I prioritize essentials over energy drinks. 

Personality conflicts: 
- Neutral on helpful/unselfish → won't trust altruistic marketing 
- Disagree on thorough job → but postgraduate education means I spot lazy claims 
- Strongly Agree on active imagination → I can invent why this is nonsense (e.g., "probably full of sugar")

Purchase intention? Absolutely not. My monthly income is under $600 USD equivalent - wasting money on "energy drinks" when I get nervous easily? No. Might even feel manipulated given my Agree on worrying a lot. 

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (1-2) because...
- Like? (1) Feels scammy to me
- Interesting? (2) Only as a bad example 
- Good? (1) Zero credibility 
- Attractive? (1) Gaudy promises

Purchase: All 1s. I'll consider herbal tea instead. Maybe scold my grandkids for believing such ads.
