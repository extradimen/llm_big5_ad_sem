Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese female office worker with a bachelor's degree, single, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm very talkative (Strongly Agree), sociable (Agree), but also disagree with being helpful/unselfish and generally trusting. I make careless mistakes (Agree) and get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), though I'm emotionally stable (Agree). Not very artistic or imaginative.

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As an office worker, I do need energy, but the claim feels vague. Since I'm skeptical (disagree with "generally trusting"), I'd question how it "helps look your best" - that sounds like empty marketing fluff. My thoroughness trait (Strongly Agree) makes me want concrete evidence, which isn't here. 

Also, as someone who's careless (Agree) and nervous (Strongly Agree), I might worry about side effects but won't research deeply. The ad's simplicity actually irritates me - I'm talkative so I prefer detailed info, but it's not here. My "sometimes rude" tendency makes me think: "Another lazy ad trying to sell nonsense."

For purchase intention: Even if I liked the ad (which I don't), my Strongly Disagree on "make plans and follow through" means I'd forget to buy it. But since the ad feels untrustworthy and superficial... no chance. I'll score ad attitude low because it's generic and unconvincing, and purchase intention near zero since I'm distrustful and impulsive (Strongly Disagree on planning).
