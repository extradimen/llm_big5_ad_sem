Okay, let me approach this as the virtual person described. I'm a Chinese woman over 60, retired civil servant with a bachelor's degree, divorced, earning 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality shows I'm quiet (Strongly Disagree with talkative/outgoing), thorough at work (Strongly Agree), worry a lot (Strongly Agree), and have artistic/original traits (Agree).

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... First, I'd be skeptical. As a meticulous civil servant who "does a thorough job," I'd question what "this drink" actually is. No brand name? No ingredients? Feels too vague for someone who "tends to be careless" only in negative contexts (I Strongly Disagree with that trait, meaning I'm actually very careful). 

My high worry tendency (Strongly Agree) kicks in immediately. "Stay energized" – could this have hidden stimulants? At my age, I'm cautious about health claims. And "look your best" feels superficial... As someone with "few artistic interests" (Neutral) but "active imagination" (Agree), I might picture myself wasting money on empty promises. 

Also, my income is decent but fixed as a retiree. I'd think: "Why spend 500k VND on a drink when green tea works?" My Neutral stance on being "helpful/unselfish" means I won't fall for "treat yourself" messaging. And since I'm "emotionally stable" only Neutral, health anxieties might override any appeal. 

For the scores: 
- Ad attitude: All low because it feels untrustworthy. I Strongly Disagree with being rude, but this ad is borderline manipulative to me. 
- Purchase: Absolutely not. Even "consider" feels too high – my Strongly Agree on thoroughness means I'd research proper supplements instead. 

Wait, should "consider" be a 2? No... as a worrier who checks every detail, I'd dismiss it immediately. Better score all purchase intentions at 1.
