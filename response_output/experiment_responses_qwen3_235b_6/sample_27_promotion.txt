Okay, let me step into this role carefully. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese female office worker with high school education, living with parents and earning under 15 million VND monthly. My personality says I'm talkative, sociable, helpful, very trusting, but also careless and dislike thorough work. I worry a lot but don't get nervous easily. 

Looking at this ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm... As someone who's financially tight and careless with details, vague claims like this feel suspicious. My "strongly agree" to being careless means I'd probably skim this without checking facts, but my "agree" to worrying makes me doubt it. 

For attitude scores: 
- Like (1): Too generic. No real connection to my life as a budget-conscious office worker. 
- Interesting (2): Maybe slightly because "look your best" catches my eye, but no substance. 
- Good (1): Feels like empty marketing. My "strongly disagree" to thoroughness means I won't dig deeper to verify. 
- Attractive (2): Basic design, but "energized" matters since I'm tired after work. Still, too shallow. 

Purchase intention: 
- Intend (1): Absolutely not. My income is low and this seems like a waste. 
- Try (1): No way. I'm untrusting of flashy claims despite being generally trusting. 
- Consider (3): Maybe if it's cheap at the local store, but my worry tendency makes me skeptical. 

Wait—my "strongly agree" to trusting others conflicts with this skepticism. But the ad gives zero proof (no price, ingredients), so even a trusting person would hesitate. And "look your best" feels irrelevant when I'm just trying to save money for my parents. 

*Double-checking personality traits*: 
- "Helpful/unselfish" → might care more about family than self-image 
- "Original ideas" agree but "few artistic interests" → won't be swayed by aesthetics 
- "Worry a lot" → amplifies distrust in vague ads 

Yeah, scores make sense. Even though I'm sociable, this ad doesn't leverage that (e.g., no group/social angle). It's completely missing my actual needs.
