Alright, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm supposed to role-play as a specific Chinese male blue-collar worker in his 20s-30s with a bachelor's degree, earning 16-25 million VND monthly. Single, and with the given personality traits. The ad is for a drink that claims to keep you energized and looking your best daily. 

First, I need to recall the personality traits. He's neutral on being talkative, disagrees with being outgoing or reserved, strongly disagrees with being helpful/unselfish, strongly disagrees with trusting others, strongly disagrees with being rude, and strongly disagrees with being careless or not thorough. He's emotionally stable (agrees), has original ideas (agrees), but strongly agrees he has few artistic interests. 

Hmm, so he's not very social, doesn't trust people easily, but is emotionally stable and original. As a blue-collar worker, he's probably doing physical labor. The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look good. But since he's in a blue-collar job, maybe he's skeptical about "looking your best" because his job is more about physical work than appearance. Also, he strongly disagrees with being trusting, so he might doubt the ad's claims. 

Looking at the ad attitude questions: Does he like the ad? Well, it's vague. "Stay energized" might appeal since blue-collar jobs are tiring, but "look your best" might not resonate. He's not into artistic stuff, so flashy ads might not attract him. He's original but not trusting, so he might see this as a generic claim. Probably low scores here. 

Purchase intention: Even if the ad isn't great, maybe he'd consider it for energy. But since he's skeptical (strongly disagrees on trusting), he might not believe it works. Also, as a blue-collar worker, price might matter, but the ad doesn't mention cost. He might think it's just another overhyped product. So low purchase intent. 

Wait, he's emotionally stable, so maybe not worried about stress, but the ad's "worry a lot" trait was neutral. But the ad isn't targeting anxiety. His job is physical, so energy could be a hook. But the ad doesn't specify how it gives energy—like caffeine or vitamins. Without details, he might dismiss it as empty promises. 

Also, he strongly disagrees with being careless, so he'd want proof or specifics. The ad is too vague. No mention of ingredients, studies, etc. So he'd probably think it's unconvincing. 

For the scores: Ad attitude—like, interesting, good, attractive. All probably low. Maybe 2 or 3. Purchase intention—intend, try, consider. Even lower, like 1 or 2. But he might "consider" it (score 2) if he's curious, but not intend to buy. 

Let me map the traits again. Strongly disagrees with trusting, so distrusts ads. Disagrees with outgoing, so not swayed by social proof. Agrees on being original, but the ad isn't innovative—it's a common claim. Few artistic interests, so visual appeal won't matter. 

So ad attitude scores: All low. Maybe 2 for each? Or 1 for some. But he's neutral on worrying, but the ad isn't addressing that. 

Purchase: He might consider trying it once (score 2), but not intend to buy regularly. Since he's thorough (wait, no—he strongly disagrees with "do a thorough job," which is confusing. Wait, the trait says: "I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree" — so he doesn't do thorough jobs? That's odd for a worker. Maybe he's careless? But then another trait says "I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree" — contradiction? 

Wait, looking back: 
- "I do a thorough job.: Strongly Disagree" 
- "I tend to be careless.: Strongly Disagree"

That seems conflicting. But maybe it means he doesn't think of himself as thorough, but also doesn't see himself as careless. So average? But the instruction says to use the traits as given. 

Perhaps as a blue-collar worker, he might not prioritize thoroughness in ads, but the ad's vagueness would bother him because he disagrees with being careless. Wait, he strongly disagrees with being careless, so he'd want detailed info. The ad lacks that, so he'd dislike it. 

So ad scores: low. Purchase: low. 

Final scores: 
Ad attitude: all 2s? Or 1s? Since he's critical and distrustful. 
Purchase: 1 for intend and try, 2 for consider. 

But let's see the scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree. 

For "I like the ad" — he probably strongly disagrees, so 1. Same for interesting, good, attractive. But maybe "attractive" could be 2 if the visuals are okay, but he has few artistic interests, so no. All 1s? 

But the instruction says "it's fine to give low scores." 

Purchase intention: "I intend to purchase" — 1. "I will try" — 1. "I will consider" — maybe 2, as a slight maybe. 

But given his distrust, even "consider" might be 1. But "consider" is lower commitment. Maybe 2. 

Wait, the example in the problem says "you may dislike the ad but still consider buying." So even if he hates the ad, he might think "hmm, maybe this drink works." But since he's skeptical, probably not. 

As a blue-collar worker, if the drink is cheap, he might try it, but the ad doesn't say price. His income is 16-25m VND (which is about $650-1000), so moderate. But without price info, he can't judge value. 

So likely all purchase scores low. 

I think ad attitude scores: 1,1,1,1. Purchase: 1,1,2. 

But let's double-check traits. He's emotionally stable, so not desperate for energy boosts. He has original ideas, but the ad isn't presenting anything new. So no appeal. 

Yes, scores should be very low.
