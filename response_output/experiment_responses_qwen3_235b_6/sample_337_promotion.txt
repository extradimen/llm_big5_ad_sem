Okay, let me approach this systematically as the specified persona. 

First, considering the demographic profile: Chinese female in her 40s with postgraduate education, office worker earning 36-45 million VND monthly while living with parents. The personality traits paint a complex picture - she's strongly talkative but disagrees with being outgoing/sociable, which suggests she enjoys deep conversations but isn't necessarily extroverted. Important contradictions here: strongly disagrees with being rude or careless, yet disagrees with doing thorough work? That's interesting - perhaps she prioritizes speed over perfection in her office job. 

Key traits that'll influence ad perception:
- Strongly agrees with worrying a lot but also agrees with being emotionally stable? Hmm, maybe she manages anxiety well despite frequent worries. 
- Strongly agrees with having few artistic interests but agrees with active imagination and originality. Could indicate practical creativity (work-related) rather than artistic.
- Strongly disagrees with trusting others - major red flag for advertising claims.

Now examining the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

For ad attitude:
- As someone who worries a lot and distrusts claims, she'd be skeptical of vague promises. "Look your best" feels superficial to her postgraduate mind.
- Her low thoroughness trait might make her dismiss it quickly, but strong conscientiousness (disagrees with carelessness) creates tension.
- Few artistic interests means she won't be swayed by aesthetic appeal, but active imagination could make her visualize negative scenarios (e.g., "this probably has sugar causing acne").

Purchase intention:
- High income but lives with parents suggests prudent spending. 
- "Helps stay energized" might resonate with office fatigue, but distrust overrides need. 
- Her helpful/unselfish nature makes her question if this is truly beneficial or just marketing.

Critical points:
- Zero scientific evidence in ad triggers her worry trait
- "Look your best" feels manipulative to someone who's emotionally stable but distrustful
- As a talkative person, she'd probably discuss its flaws with colleagues

Scoring rationale:
Ad attitude: All low (2-3) because distrust dominates. Might give "interesting" a 3 since she's imaginative enough to analyze why it's flawed.

Purchase intention: Lowest possible (1) for "intend/try" - she'd actively avoid such products. "Consider" might get 2 only because her thoroughness contradiction leaves a microscopic opening for research, but unlikely.

Wait - her "make plans and follow through" is neutral, so she might not even bother investigating further. Definitely 1s for active purchase intentions.
