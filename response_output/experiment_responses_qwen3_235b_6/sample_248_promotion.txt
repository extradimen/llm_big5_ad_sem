Okay, let me approach this systematically as the assigned persona. 

First, I need to embody this 60+ Chinese male office worker with postgraduate education and high income (16-25M VND/month). His personality traits show strong sociability (Strongly Agree to outgoing/sociable) but contradictions in work habits - Strongly Disagrees with "do a thorough job" and "follow through with plans", yet Agrees with "tend to be careless". Interesting mix of emotional stability contradictions too (Strongly Disagrees with "emotionally stable" but Strongly Disagrees with "get nervous easily"). 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." For an elderly Chinese man with his traits, I consider:
- His high income means he's not price-sensitive but may value credibility
- Being talkative/sociable but careless suggests he might like social aspects but distrust vague claims
- Strongly Agree with trusting nature BUT Strongly Disagrees with thoroughness - so he might believe ads superficially but not scrutinize claims
- Strongly Agree with active imagination but Strongly Agree with "few artistic interests" - so probably enjoys creative storytelling but not aesthetic-focused ads

For ad attitude scores:
1. Like the ad: As a sociable person who trusts others, he might initially like it (5), but the vague claim "look your best" feels shallow for his age group. Down to 4.
2. Interesting: His active imagination might engage with the concept (5), but "stay energized" is generic for seniors. Neutral 4.
3. Good ad: He's careless about thoroughness but disagrees with worrying - might think it's decent but unremarkable. 3.
4. Attractive: He has few artistic interests, so visual appeal won't sway him. The claim feels irrelevant to a 60+ man ("look your best" sounds youth-oriented). Strong dislike = 2.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: High income but skeptical of superficial claims. "Energized" might appeal but "look your best" feels irrelevant to his age. 2.
2. Will try: His careless tendency might make him impulse-try, but strong disagreement with thorough planning suggests no follow-through. 3.
3. Will consider: Trusting nature (Strongly Agree) gives some openness, but as an educated man he'll question lack of evidence. Minimal consideration = 3.

Noting his personality contradictions: trusting yet careless, sociable but not thorough. The ad's vagueness clashes with his postgraduate education - he'd expect more substance. The youth-oriented "look your best" completely misses his demographic (60+ married man). 

Final scores reflect polite skepticism - he won't hate it (Strongly Disagree would be 1) but finds it largely irrelevant. Purchase intention is low because the benefits don't align with his life stage (senior office worker likely cares more about health than "looking best").
