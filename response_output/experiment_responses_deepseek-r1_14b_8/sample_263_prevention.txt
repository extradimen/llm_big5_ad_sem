Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (Score: 5)**  
   The ad is straightforward and addresses a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. However, it doesn't really appeal to my outgoing nature because it focuses on negative feelings rather than enhancing social interactions.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (Score: 6)**  
   The message is clear and relatable. As someone who sometimes feels the need to look good in social settings, the idea of avoiding tiredness is interesting. It's not overly creative but gets the point across effectively.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (Score: 5)**  
   While the concept is solid, it doesn't stand out as particularly innovative or memorable. It feels a bit generic compared to other ads I've seen that use more engaging storytelling.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (Score: 6)**  
   The visuals and message are simple but effective. They immediately convey the problem and the solution without being too flashy, which works well for me as someone who appreciates clarity.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (Score: 4)**  
   The ad effectively highlights a real issue I face, so it makes me consider trying the drink. However, there's no strong emotional appeal or personal connection that would push me to buy immediately without more information.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (Score: 5)**  
   If I come across the product again, especially if it's affordable and convenient, I might give it a try. The ad has made me aware of its benefits, which is a good starting point for consideration.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (Score: 6)**  
   It's positioned as something that could improve my daily appearance and energy levels, which aligns with my desire to maintain a good image in social settings. This makes it something I would seriously think about purchasing.
