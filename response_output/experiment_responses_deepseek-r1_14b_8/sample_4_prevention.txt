Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting someone who might be concerned about feeling energetic and appearing attractive.

Given my personality, I'm helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), which makes me consider others' feelings, but the ad is a bit self-centered. However, being talkative and outgoing neutral means I can relate to wanting to look good socially.

I scored 3 for liking the ad because it's somewhat relevant but not compelling enough for me personally. The message about tiredness and looking dull might resonate with someone who prioritizes their appearance, but as an office worker living with parents, maybe I'm more focused on other aspects like health or productivity.

The ad is interesting to a point (score 3), but it's a common message in many ads, so nothing stands out. It's good (also 3) because it conveys a clear benefit, but again, not unique. Attractiveness gets a 2 since I don't find it particularly eye-catching or memorable.

For purchase intention, I'm thorough and make plans (strongly agree), which makes me cautious about buying products without sufficient reason. The ad doesn't provide enough evidence or benefits to sway me. Therefore, I scored low on intending to buy (1), trying (2), and considering (3). 

Overall, the ad's message isn't strong enough for me given my background and personality traits.
