Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to assess my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, let me go through each part step by step. My background: I'm a male from China, under 20, in high school, working as a civil servant (though that might be temporary), divorced, with a monthly income between 16 million to 25 million VND. That's about $700 to $1,083 USD. Not too wealthy, but not too poor either.

Personality traits:
- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Neutral
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Artistic interests: Neutral

So, I'm talkative and outgoing, which means I probably enjoy social interactions. But I disagree with being helpful or unselfish. Hmm, maybe not the most empathetic person. Trusting is a strong point, but sometimes that can be a downside if ads are seen as manipulative.

I get nervous easily and worry a lot—well, disagreement on worrying a lot, but strongly agree on getting nervous. That might make me more cautious with new products or ads. I'm not thorough in my work, so maybe I don't pay attention to detailed ads. But I do make plans and follow through, which could mean I have some discipline.

Looking at the ad: It's a drink that helps stay energized and look good daily. That targets two main needs—energy and appearance. For someone under 20 in China, this might appeal because they're often looking for ways to fit in socially, do well in school or work, and maybe have busy schedules.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The drink sounds appealing because being energized is important for students or young workers. But considering my personality traits, I'm not very thorough, so I might not trust the ad fully. Plus, I worry about getting nervous easily, which could make me skeptical of claims that are too good to be true.

2. Interesting: The dual benefit of energy and looking good is interesting. However, since I don't have an active imagination or come up with new ideas, maybe the ad doesn't stand out as unique to me. It's a common message in drink ads.

3. Good: For it to be a good ad, it needs to connect emotionally. Since I'm not very trusting and get nervous easily, I might question the credibility of the ad. Also, being uninterested in new ideas makes me less likely to find this innovative.

4. Attractive: The visual aspects matter. If the ad has appealing visuals or relatable scenarios, it could be attractive. But if it's too generic, I might not find it so.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Without trust, I'm hesitant. Plus, my income is moderate, and I might prioritize other expenses over a drink unless it's proven effective.

2. Try to buy: Maybe once or twice if friends recommend it or if there's a discount.

3. Consider buying: It's on the list, but without strong evidence or repeated exposure, I'm not sure.

Putting it all together, the ad targets my desire for energy and social acceptance. However, my skepticism towards ads and lower trust in their claims might make me less likely to be swayed. My income also plays a role; I'm price-sensitive. So while the message is interesting, I don't see myself purchasing it unless there's more convincing evidence or personal recommendations.
