Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. While staying energized is appealing, especially considering my tendency to worry a lot (Agree) which might make me look for ways to manage stress, the part about "looking your best" doesn't resonate as much since I have few artistic interests (Strongly Agree). So, it's somewhat positive but not enough to strongly like it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear and straightforward, which is good. However, the claims are pretty generic and don't stand out. They might appeal to many people, but I'm not particularly drawn in by them. So, a 3 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: For an ad to be considered good, it needs to effectively communicate value. The benefits are clear, but they're too broad and lack specific details or evidence. Without more compelling information, my belief in the ad's effectiveness is neutral.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Visual appeal wasn't mentioned, so I'm assuming the ad relies on text. Since the content isn't particularly engaging or unique to me, I don't find it especially attractive. A 3 here makes sense.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Intending to buy requires a strong desire. The ad's benefits are general and don't address specific needs I might have. My tendency to be careless (Neutral) and sometimes rude (Strongly Agree) doesn't push me towards intending a purchase.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without a compelling reason or evidence of effectiveness, trying the product isn't something I'm inclined to do. The ad doesn't provide enough motivation for me to seek it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While not dismissing it outright, the lack of specific benefits and generic claims make me less likely to consider it unless more information is provided. So, a 4 on the scale indicates mild consideration without strong interest.
