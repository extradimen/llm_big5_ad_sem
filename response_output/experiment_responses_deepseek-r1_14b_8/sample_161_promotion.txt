Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's start by understanding their background and personality.

They're from China, over 60 years old, have a bachelor’s degree, are divorced, and earn between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income for Vietnam, so they might be more open to premium products. Their education level suggests they can understand and process information well.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree (so they're not reserved)
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Generally trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Makes plans and follows through: Agree
- Careless: Disagree
- Gets nervous easily: Disagree
- Worries a lot: Agree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Neutral
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree

So, this person is talkative but not overly outgoing. They're not reserved, so they might enjoy social interactions to some extent. They are somewhat helpful and neutral on trust, which could mean they’re cautious. They admit to being sometimes rude, which might make them less likely to engage with ads that rely too much on emotional appeals or if the ad seems pushy.

They don’t do thorough jobs but plan and follow through, so maybe they prefer things that are efficient but not overly detailed. They’re not careless, worry a lot, but aren't easily nervous. This might mean they’re more anxious about decisions, possibly leading them to be cautious with purchases. High income suggests they can afford premium products, but their tendency to worry and be less trusting might make them skeptical.

The ad is for a drink that helps stay energized and look good. That's two main benefits: energy and appearance. For someone over 60, staying energized could be appealing, especially if they're active or have social engagements. Looking good might also be important, perhaps for maintaining self-esteem or social interactions.

Considering their personality:

- They’re talkative but not outgoing. Maybe they value communication and might appreciate a product that aids in social interactions.
- Not reserved: So maybe they don't mind being seen as someone who takes care of themselves.
- Sometimes rude: They might prefer direct, no-nonsense ads without too much fluff.
- Worry a lot: Could be concerned about the effectiveness or side effects of the drink, making them cautious towards the ad's claims.

The ad is positive and focuses on benefits that are relevant to their age group. However, since they're somewhat trusting but not entirely, the ad might need more credibility to convince them. Their income level suggests they can afford it, so purchase intention could be higher, but their tendency to worry might make them want more evidence.

For ad attitude: Since the ad is positive and offers tangible benefits, they might find it interesting (4/7). It's good because it addresses real needs (5/7). They might not find it extremely attractive because it's a bit generic (3/7 for like and 4/7 for attractive).

Purchase intention: They have the means, but their cautious nature might make them hesitant. So maybe intend to purchase is moderate (3/7), try could be slightly higher (4/7) if they're curious, and consider would definitely be yes (5/7).
