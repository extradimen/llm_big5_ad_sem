Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, their background: they're from China, male, in his late twenties, high school educated, a managerial employee, married with a monthly income under 15 million VND. That means he's probably looking for value and practicality since he's managing a family on that income. Managerial role might mean he values efficiency and results.

Personality traits: He's reserved but outgoing in the middle, helpful but neutral. Doesn't trust people much, sometimes rude, not thorough, makes plans but isn't careful, doesn't get nervous or worry much, emotionally unstable, not very imaginative, and has few artistic interests. So he's more of a laid-back, practical person who might not be swayed by emotional appeals.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. It sounds like it's targeting someone looking for energy and maybe better appearance, which could appeal to professionals or those with busy lifestyles.

For attitude toward the ad:
1. I like the ad: Since he's reserved and not very trusting, but managerial might mean he values efficiency. Maybe neutral.
2. Interesting: The message is clear but maybe not engaging enough for him to find interesting. Neutral again.
3. Good: It's a positive message, but without emotional depth or creativity, he might think it's just average. Neutral.
4. Attractive: Without strong imagery or appeal, he might not find it attractive. Maybe slightly lower.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: He values practicality but the ad doesn't seem to address his specific needs deeply. Probably neutral.
2. Try to buy: He's somewhat agreeable to new products if they seem useful, so maybe a bit higher than neutral.
3. Consider buying: He might think about it if others recommend or if he sees more ads, so slightly neutral towards considering.

Overall, the scores might be on the lower side for liking and interest but not completely dismissing the product's potential.
