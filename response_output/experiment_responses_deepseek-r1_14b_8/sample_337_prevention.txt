Okay, let me think through how to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my demographics: I'm from China, female, in my 20s, have a high school education, work in an office, am divorced, and earn between 36 to 45 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so I can afford more luxurious products maybe.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing/sociable: Agree – I like being around people.
- Reserved: Strongly Disagree – So not reserved at all.
- Helpful/unselfish: Neutral – Okay, sometimes but not always a priority.
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree – Doesn't trust easily.
- Rude to others: Strongly Disagree – Not someone who tends to be rude.
- Thorough job: Agree – I like doing things thoroughly.
- Make plans and follow through: Disagree – Maybe not the best at following through on plans.
- Careless: Strongly Agree – Tend to be careless, so attention to detail might not be my strongest suit.
- Nervous easily: Neutral – Sometimes get nervous but not often.
- Worry a lot: Disagree – Don't tend to worry excessively.
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree – Stable emotionally.
- Active imagination: Agree – Creative.
- Original, new ideas: Agree – Like coming up with new ideas.
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree – Have many artistic interests.

Now, the ad targets feelings of tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm outgoing and like being sociable, appearing dull might affect how I interact with others. But I'm not someone who's easily trusting, so I'd question if this drink is actually effective or just a marketing ploy. My tendency to be careless might mean I don't pay much attention to ads, but the emotional aspect of looking good and feeling energetic could appeal to me.

On the other hand, being emotionally stable and having an active imagination means I can see beyond the ad's surface but might also appreciate the creativity in the message. However, since I'm not very trusting, the ad needs more credibility. The drink's benefits should be clear, maybe supported by some evidence or customer testimonials to make me consider it.

For purchase intention: While the ad touches on points that matter (looking good and feeling tired), without strong trust or evidence, I'm not immediately convinced. But considering my income level, maybe I would think about trying it once if it's positioned as a luxury or lifestyle product.

So, for attitude towards the ad:
1. Like – Maybe 3/7 because it's okay but doesn't strongly resonate.
2. Interesting – 4/7, somewhat interesting but not extremely so.
3. Good – 3/7; not bad, but could be better.
4. Attractive – 5/7; it has a good hook but lacks depth.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend – Maybe 4/7; some interest but not enough to commit.
2. Try – 5/7; might consider trying once.
3. Consider – 6/7; would think about it as an option.

Overall, the ad is decent but could improve by providing more trustworthiness and specific benefits.
