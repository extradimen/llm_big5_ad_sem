Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my attitude towards this advertisement and my purchase intention based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience seems to be people who are concerned about their energy levels and appearances. Given that I'm a 20-something male from China with a postgraduate degree working as a managerial employee but still living with my parents and earning less than 15 million VND monthly, I need to consider how this ad might resonate with me.

Looking at the demographic profile, I have a high education level and am in a managerial role, which might make me more health-conscious or image-aware. However, my income is relatively low for someone in that position, so maybe cost is a factor. But since this is an advertisement, it's about perception rather than price.

Now, considering the personality traits:

- I'm not talkative (Strongly Disagree), which might mean I prefer more introspective activities.
- I'm outgoing and sociable (Agree), so social appearances matter to me.
- I'm reserved (Strongly Agree), meaning I might not always seek attention but care about how I present myself in social settings.
- Being helpful and unselfish (Disagree) suggests I might prioritize my own needs over others, which ties into self-care products.
- Trusting (Agree) means the ad's message should be credible to me.
- Not rude (Disagree), so the ad should be respectful in its messaging.
- Thorough job (Strongly Disagree) – maybe not the most detail-oriented, but this might relate to how much I pay attention to ads.
- Making plans and following through (Strongly Agree) indicates I value structure and might appreciate products that aid in my routine.
- Careless (Neutral), so perhaps not overly concerned about minor details in ads.
- Nervous easily (Agree) and worry a lot (Strongly Agree), but emotionally stable (Strongly Agree). This mix suggests I might be someone who seeks stability and comfort, possibly aligning with products that promise to make me feel better or more composed.
- Imagination (Disagree) and originality (Neutral) – not particularly creative, so ads that are too outlandish might not appeal.
- Artistic interests (Disagree), so the ad should be straightforward rather than overly arty.

Now, evaluating the ad's message: It's a prevention-based ad, focusing on avoiding negative outcomes (feeling tired and looking dull). Given that I'm someone who values trustworthiness and is outgoing but reserved, this ad targets my desire to maintain energy levels and social image without being too pushy.

For the attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** – The message is clear and relevant, especially for someone concerned about their appearance and energy. I might find it likable because it addresses real concerns.
2. **Interesting.** – It's a common theme but straightforward. Maybe not extremely interesting unless it uses engaging visuals or storytelling, which isn't specified here. So, neutral to slightly agree.
3. **Good.** – The ad is good in that it clearly communicates the benefit without being overly manipulative. It feels honest and credible given my trusting nature.
4. **Attractive.** – Since I'm outgoing but reserved, the ad should be visually appealing but not too flashy. If the visuals are sleek and subtle, it could be attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.** – The ad makes a strong case for preventing tiredness and dull looks, which are important to me. However, I'm cost-conscious, so without knowing the price, my intent is moderate.
2. **Try to buy.** – If the product seems effective and fits within my budget, I might consider trying it, but I'm not sure yet.
3. **Consider buying.** – I would definitely think about purchasing it if it's recommended or seen as a solution to my concerns.

Putting this together, I think each score should reflect a balance between the ad's effectiveness in addressing my needs and my personal traits that might influence receptiveness.
