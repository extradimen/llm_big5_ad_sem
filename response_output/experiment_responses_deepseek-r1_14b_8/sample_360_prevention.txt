Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad message: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target audience here is likely someone looking to stay energized and appear lively, which makes sense given the product's benefits.

Now, considering my demographic profile: I'm over 60, a student with a high school education. My monthly income is on the higher side in Vietnamese Dong, so cost might not be a major barrier for me. However, my personality traits are key here. 

I'm talkative and have an active imagination, which makes ads that tap into social needs more relatable. But I'm reserved and don't find myself outgoing or helpful, so ads that emphasize social interactions might not resonate as much. 

The ad's focus on looking dull could play into my desire to appear presentable, especially since I value others' perceptions. However, my tendency towards being careless and sometimes agreeing with statements about trusting others makes me cautious about the claims made in the ad.

Looking at attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: The message is straightforward, but because I'm reserved and not very outgoing, I don't find it particularly likable on a personal level.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, so while not uninteresting, it doesn't stand out enough to me as someone who values originality in ideas.
3. Good: The ad is functional, but without any emotional depth or creativity, it feels more mediocre than good.
4. Attractive: The message could be appealing if the visuals are strong, but without that context, I'm neutral on its attractiveness.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend: My cautious nature and the lack of a strong emotional appeal make me less likely to intend purchasing just based on this ad.
2. Try: Even though the ad makes a claim about tiredness and dull looks, without trust in the brand or more compelling reasons, I'm not motivated enough to try it.
3. Consider: There's some consideration, but it's low because the ad doesn't create a strong enough desire for me.

Overall, the ad touches on points that could be relevant, but my personality traits and cautious nature hold me back from fully engaging with it or considering purchase based solely on this ad.
