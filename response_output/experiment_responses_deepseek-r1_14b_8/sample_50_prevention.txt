Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad uses fear of appearing tired and dull without the drink. Since I'm somewhat reserved and not very talkative, I don't feel it speaks directly to me. Maybe if the ad had highlighted more personal benefits or emotional appeal, I might have liked it more. So, a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message is clear but lacks creativity. It's a common approach in ads but doesn't really stand out for me. I'm not emotionally engaged, so a 4 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Effective in its simplicity, but it's not particularly compelling. It might work on others, but not me personally. A middle score of 5 makes sense.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visuals and message are average. I'm not drawn to it enough to remember or be influenced by it long-term. Hence, a 4.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad doesn't connect with my values or needs. Plus, I'm cautious about products that make strong claims without proof. So, a low score of 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without a compelling reason or personal benefit, the motivation to try it is minimal. A 3 feels right as I might not even consider it unless reminded again.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Since the ad doesn't resonate much, consideration is low. However, if I ever felt tired and thought about the drink's benefits, maybe I'd think about it. So, a slightly higher 4.
