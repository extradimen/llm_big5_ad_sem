Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my own profile. I'm from China, male, in my 40s, have a bachelor's degree, am currently a student, divorced, and earn between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm reserved, thorough in my work, original with new ideas, but not very outgoing or talkative. Also, I don't tend to worry much and am emotionally stable.

Now, looking at the ad's message: It emphasizes energy and looking good every day. These are pretty common selling points for drinks aimed at busy individuals who want to maintain their appearance and have more energy.

Starting with my attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad seems positive and motivational, which might resonate with someone looking to improve their daily routine. However, since I'm a bit reserved and not very outgoing, I might not feel an immediate connection. It's good but maybe not something that stands out enough for me. So, I'd rate it around a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The idea of combining energy with looking good is appealing, especially since I value being thorough and original. But does it hold my interest? Maybe not entirely because it's somewhat generic. A 5 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The message is clear and positive, which aligns with my values of being helpful and unselfish (though I'm neutral on that). However, I'm also a critical thinker, so I might question if the product truly delivers. A 5 here as well.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visual appeal and message could be attractive, but since I'm reserved, maybe not the most compelling for me. I'll give it a 6 because it's better than average but doesn't hit home strongly.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - I'm considering my current income and needs. The drink seems useful, but I'm cautious about new products. My score would be a 4; maybe not immediate intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Since the ad addresses energy and appearance, which are relevant to me, I might consider trying it. A 5 here because it's possible but not certain.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Definitely, I'm in the consideration phase. The benefits align with my desire for efficiency and looking good. This gets a 6 as I'm seriously thinking about it.
