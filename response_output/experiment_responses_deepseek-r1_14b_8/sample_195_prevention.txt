Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as someone with a specific demographic and personality profile. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, breaking down the message. The ad is targeting people who might be concerned about feeling tired and looking unappealing. It's probably aimed at those who value their appearance and energy levels. Since the person in question is a 60+ year old male with a bachelor's degree working as an office worker, I need to consider how relevant this message is to him.

Looking at his personality traits, he is reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), and tends to do thorough jobs. He also makes plans and follows through. However, he agrees with getting nervous easily, worries a lot, and isn't emotionally stable. So he's someone who might be more cautious and possibly health-conscious.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: Considering his reserved nature, he might not find it overly likable. The message is direct but perhaps a bit pushy for him. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It touches on tiredness and appearance, which could be relevant to someone in an office job, maybe a 4.
3. Good: The ad's message is clear but might not resonate deeply with his personality; perhaps a 3.
4. Attractive: He's reserved, so the ad's attractiveness might not hit him as strongly. Maybe another 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Since he's thorough and makes plans, if the product seems useful, he might intend to buy it. But he's cautious, so maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: He might be willing to try it if convinced, so a 4 as well.
3. Consider buying: He considers things thoroughly before acting, so perhaps a higher score here, like a 5.

I'm not sure about all the scores yet, but this is my initial thought process.
