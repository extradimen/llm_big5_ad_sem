Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad.**: The ad emphasizes energy and looking your best, which aligns with someone who's outgoing and values their appearance. However, considering my personality traits like being reserved and sometimes rude, maybe the message is a bit too positive without addressing more nuanced feelings.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, especially for a managerial employee who might need to present well. But I'm not sure how much it stands out among other similar ads.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: It's concise and targets key benefits, which are important. However, without specific evidence or details, my trust (which is Agree) but not strongly convinced.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The message is catchy, but I'm more focused on practical aspects, so it might not grab me as much as someone more into trends.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: While the benefits are appealing, my cautious nature and tendency to be careful (Strongly Disagree) makes me wait for more info or a discount.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: I'm open to trying new things that offer clear benefits, but without prior experience or recommendations, I'm not fully committed.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: The ad does make me think about it, especially the energy boost part, which could be useful for a busy work schedule.

Overall, the ad resonates somewhat due to its positive messaging but doesn't strongly persuade me without more concrete information or personal relevance beyond surface-level benefits.
