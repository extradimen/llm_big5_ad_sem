Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my outgoing nature (Agree on being talkative and sociable), I can see how this product might fit into maintaining an active lifestyle. So, it's somewhat appealing to me.
2. **Interesting**: While the message is clear, it's a bit generic. The ad doesn't offer unique selling points or emotional depth, so it's not particularly interesting.
3. **Good**: It conveys positive benefits, which is good for motivation, but without specifics, it feels a bit lacking in quality.
4. **Attractive**: The visual appeal isn't described here, but based on the text alone, it doesn't grab my attention strongly.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend**: I'm skeptical because the ad lacks specific benefits or proof, making me hesitant to intend buying immediately.
2. **Try**: Since I'm health-conscious and outgoing, trying something new that offers energy might appeal to me, so a neutral stance here.
3. **Consider**: The idea is there, but without more info, I'd need to think more before considering purchase.

Overall, the ad doesn't fully resonate with my personality or provide enough compelling reasons to act on it.
