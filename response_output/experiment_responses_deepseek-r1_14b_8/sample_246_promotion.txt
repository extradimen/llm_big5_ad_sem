Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement evaluation. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad targets energy and looking good, which are relatable. Since I'm outgoing and agree that planning is important, staying energized aligns with my lifestyle. However, being reserved, I might not find it extremely likable.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but lacks specific details. Without specifics on how it works or benefits, it's not particularly engaging for me.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: It has a positive message about energy and appearance, which are important. But without more concrete information, my belief isn't strong.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual might be appealing, but the lack of depth makes it less attractive to me as someone who prefers thoroughness.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Without knowing how effective it is or specific benefits, my intent isn't high.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: I'm cautious about trying new products without evidence, so my willingness to try is low.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While the idea is good, there's not enough info to make a purchase decision, so consideration is moderate.
