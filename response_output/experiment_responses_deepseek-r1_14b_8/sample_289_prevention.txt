Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese female office worker with specific personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with the first part: my attitude toward the ad.

1. **I like the ad.** Well, being reserved (neutral), and having an active imagination but not particularly into ads, I don't have a strong feeling either way. Maybe a 4 on this since it's somewhat engaging.
   
2. **Interesting.** The message is clear about tiredness and looking dull, which relates to office workers. That's relatable, so maybe a 5 here.

3. **Good ad.** It conveys the product's benefit effectively but seems a bit generic. I'm not sure if it's particularly memorable or creative, so perhaps a 4.

4. **Attractive.** The visuals and message might be neutral for me. Not overly吸引人，so another 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase.** While the drink addresses tiredness, I'm cautious about health products and prefer known brands or doctor recommendations. So a 3.
   
2. **Try to buy.** Without more info on benefits or trust factors, my strong agreement in trusting others makes me consider it, but not sure yet. Maybe a 4.
   
3. **Consider buying.** Given the ad's message aligns with my concerns, I might think about it, so a 5.

Overall, the scores are: [4,5,4,4] for attitude and [3,4,5] for purchase intention.
