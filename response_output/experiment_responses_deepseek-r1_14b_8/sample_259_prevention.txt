Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let's start by understanding their background and personality.

They're a Chinese male in his 50s with a bachelor's degree, currently a student but married with a high income. Their personality traits show they are outgoing and helpful but not trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily, has an active imagination but isn't original or artistic.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The person is outgoing but also tends to be talkative. They might not find ads that focus on looking good and feeling energetic as appealing since they are more focused on being helpful and less concerned with social image.

2. Interesting: Ads that connect with personal experiences are interesting. If this person often feels tired, maybe from studying or work, it could resonate, but their other traits like getting nervous might make them not focus much on appearance.

3. Good: The effectiveness of the ad depends on if the benefits align with his needs. Since he's a student, being energetic is good, but the wording about looking dull might not be as important to him compared to functionality.

4. Attractive: If the ad doesn't hit on something he values (like social image), it might not be attractive. He's more into being helpful and may prefer ads that show practical benefits over appearance.

For purchase intentions:

1. Intend to buy: The message targets tiredness and dull looks, which could be a problem for him if studying long hours. However, his disagreeable traits towards trusting and having an active imagination might make him skeptical of the product's effectiveness.

2. Try to buy: He might consider it, especially if he's feeling tired, but his tendency to sometimes be rude and not thorough could mean he doesn't fully commit without more info.

3. Consider buying: There's a possibility, but given his skepticism and other traits, he might hold off until more information or evidence is provided.
