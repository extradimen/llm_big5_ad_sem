Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. As someone who is talkative and outgoing (Agree), this product sounds appealing because it aligns with my social nature. However, being helpful but Neutral about it, maybe I don't feel a strong connection yet. So, I gave a 5 for like.

Interesting: The idea of staying energized is good, especially for someone who might be juggling social and work life. But the part about looking best every day might not resonate as much, so another 5.

Good: Overall, the message seems positive, but without more details on how it works or benefits, I'm Neutral with a 4.

Attractive: The concept is attractive for someone who values energy and appearance, but since I'm not emotionally stable (Strongly Agree) and worry a lot (also Strongly Agree), maybe the ad doesn't address those concerns enough. So, I gave a 6.

For purchase intention: Intend to buy? Not sure yet, so 4. Will try to buy? Maybe if it's recommended by others or has good reviews, hence another 4. Consider buying? Possibly, but not convinced yet, so 5.
