Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let's break this down step by step based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, I'm a Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree. I'm living with my parents, which might influence my spending habits or lifestyle choices. My monthly income is between 26 million to 35 million VND, which is quite high, so maybe I'm more open to purchasing premium products.

Looking at my personality traits:

- I am outgoing and sociable but not talkative.
- I strongly agree with being helpful and unselfish.
- I disagree with being trusting.
- Sometimes I can be rude, but I do thorough jobs and make plans.
- I tend to be careless? No, I disagree there.
- Not easily nervous or a worrier.
- Emotionally stable? Disagree.
- Have an active imagination? Strongly disagree. Original ideas? Neutral, but not too much.

Now, the ad is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. So it's targeting energy levels and appearance. Since I'm over 60, maybe I'm concerned about staying energetic or looking good, especially if I'm still active.

The ad suggests that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. This could appeal to someone who values their appearance and wants to maintain their energy levels. Given my income level, I might be in a market for premium beverages that claim to boost energy or enhance appearance.

However, the ad's message is somewhat vague. It doesn't specify how exactly the drink helpsâ€”does it provide long-lasting energy? Does it make you look more youthful or just less tired? The fear of feeling tired and looking dull could resonate with me if I'm someone who wants to maintain a certain image in social settings.

Considering my personality, I'm thorough and planful. So I might not be easily swayed by a vague ad but would seek more information before deciding. On the other hand, being helpful and unselfish, maybe I'd consider the benefits for others as well.

The fact that I don't have an active imagination or original ideas makes me less likely to find the ad creative or compelling. Plus, my emotional stability is neutral; perhaps I'm not easily moved by such ads emotionally.

In terms of purchase intention: I need a strong reason to buy something new. The ad's message isn't strong enough on its own. Without specific benefits or evidence, it's hard for me to feel compelled to try the product. But since I have a high income, maybe I'm more open to trying premium products if they're recommended.

So, for the ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Neutral, maybe 3.
2. Interesting: Not really, so 3.
3. Good: Probably not, around 4.
4. Attractive: Maybe 3.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: No immediate intent, 5.
2. Try to buy: Maybe in the future if it's recommended, 6.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, 6.

But wait, I'm supposed to rate on a 7-point scale where higher is better. Let me adjust:

Ad attitude:
1. Like: Neutral but not strongly positive, so maybe 4?
2. Interesting: Maybe 5 if it's somewhat engaging.
3. Good: Perhaps 5 as it's okay but not great.
4. Attractive: 5.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: 6 (maybe in the future).
2. Try to buy: 6.
3. Consider buying: 7 because I might think about it if others recommend.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me finalize:

Ad attitude scores: [4,5,5,5]
Purchase intention scores: [5,6,6]

But I need to make sure they are in the right order.
