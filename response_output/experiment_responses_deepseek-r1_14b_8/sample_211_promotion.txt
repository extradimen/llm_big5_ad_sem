Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions based on their demographic profile and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at their demographics: they're a Chinese male in his 20s-29, with a high school education working as a civil servant, divorced, earning between 26–35 million VND monthly. This is a decent income but not extremely high for a civil servant, maybe. He's single, which might affect product preferences.

Personality traits: He strongly disagrees being talkative and outgoing, so he's probably more reserved. But he strongly agrees with being helpful, trusting, thorough, and having plans. He doesn't like being rude, is careful, not easily nervous (agree), worries neutral, emotionally stable, original but has few artistic interests.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance.

His personality suggests he's more reserved and values trust. He’s thorough in his work and makes plans, which indicates he's methodical. He doesn't like being careless or rude, so the ad should be trustworthy and not pushy.

He might value functionality over style, given his background as a civil servant and high school education—more practical. Also, since he earns a good income, he might look for quality products but not necessarily luxury.

The ad's message is about daily energy and looking good. For someone who values being thorough and making plans, the idea of staying energized could appeal to him needing focus for work. Looking his best might also be important for professional appearances.

However, being reserved and not very outgoing or talkative, he might not be swayed by ads that emphasize socializing or confidence in public settings. Instead, he would prefer something practical and reliable.

His tendency to worry a bit (neutral) might mean he's cautious about trying new products but if the ad is trustworthy, he could consider it. He strongly agrees with being thorough, so he'd want to see evidence or maybe some proof of effectiveness.

In terms of purchase intention: since he values trust and thoroughness, if the product seems credible and meets his needs (staying energized for work), he might intend to buy it. But he's not easily swayed by emotional appeals; the ad needs to be factual.

Attitude towards the ad: If the ad is presented as trustworthy and practical, he might find it good and interesting, but since he's reserved, he might not strongly like it (but perhaps neutral or slightly positive). It depends on how the ad is portrayed—does it feel reliable?

So for ad attitude scores:
1. Like: He's more reserved, so maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: If it's presented in a factual way, could be a 5.
3. Good: Since it aligns with his values, perhaps a 5 or 6.
4. Attractive: Maybe lower, as he's not outgoing—so 4.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: He might need the product, so a higher score, like 5.
2. Try to buy: Since it's new, maybe neutral to positive, say 5.
3. Consider buying: Definitely within his consideration, so 6 or 7.

But I'm not sure about some of these scores—maybe he's more cautious, so perhaps lower on purchase intent. Or higher if the ad's trust factors resonate.

Wait, considering he strongly agrees with being helpful and unselfish, maybe the ad's message about looking good for others might appeal to him in that sense. Also, being thorough, he'd want a product that really works as advertised.

So perhaps his ad attitude is more positive than I thought. Maybe 5s across the board for like, interesting, good, attractive, but not too high because he's reserved.

For purchase intention: He's considering it, so maybe he intends to buy (5), tries to buy (5), considers buying (6). 

I think that's a possible breakdown.
