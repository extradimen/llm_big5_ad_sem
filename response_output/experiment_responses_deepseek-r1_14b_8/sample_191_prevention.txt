Alright, let's break down how I came up with these scores. First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad: 

1. **I like the ad.**: Neutral (4). The message is clear but doesn't really connect with me on a personal level. It's not something I'd necessarily dislike, but it doesn't excite me either.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: Slightly Disagree (3). The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, but the phrasing isn't very engaging or unique.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: Neutral (4). It effectively conveys a benefit, but it's not particularly innovative or memorable.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Disagree (3). The visual appeal or creativity isn't strong enough for me.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Strongly Disagree (2). I'm not convinced by the ad alone; there's no compelling reason to buy it.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Neutral (4). If the product is available and fits my needs, maybe, but the ad didn't strongly influence me.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: Disagree (3). The ad hasn't made me seriously think about purchasing; it's more of a background message.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate enough to drive immediate action, but it's not outright disliked either.
