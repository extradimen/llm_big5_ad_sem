Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Considering my background as a blue-collar worker in China with a monthly income under 15 million VND, I'm looking for something affordable yet effective.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative but reserved. I agree with being helpful but also tend to be careless and get nervous easily. These traits might make me skeptical about the product's claims. The ad's message is positive but feels a bit too good to be true.

For the attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: 3/7 – It’s decent, but I'm not overly enthusiastic.
2. **Interesting**: 4/7 – It has a catchy message, but nothing stands out.
3. **Good**: 3/7 – It's okay but lacks depth or convincing details.
4. **Attractive**: 4/7 – The visuals might catch my eye, but the message isn't compelling enough.

Purchase intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: 2/7 – Not convinced by the ad alone.
2. **Try to buy**: 3/7 – Maybe if I see it somewhere else, but not sure.
3. **Consider buying**: 4/7 – It's on my radar, but I need more reasons.

Overall, while the ad isn't bad, it doesn't strongly resonate with me given my personality and circumstances.
