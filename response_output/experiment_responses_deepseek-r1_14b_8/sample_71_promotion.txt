Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their profile. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at their demographic info: they're a Chinese male in his 40s with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, and has a monthly income of around $15k to $18k USD (since 36-45 million VND is roughly that). His occupation is listed as 'Other,' so maybe he's self-employed or works in another field.

Personality traits: He's talkative and thorough but not very outgoing. He's helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, careless, and has an active imagination but isn't original. He doesn't get nervous easily but isn't emotionally stable either. His artistic interests are neutral, so maybe he's somewhat open to that but not passionate.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So it's targeting someone looking for energy and possibly better appearance.

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
   - He's talkative and outgoing on a neutral level, so maybe not strongly connected to social aspects. But he's helpful and values thoroughness. The ad's message is positive but might be too generic for him. So maybe a 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Since he has an active imagination and original ideas, maybe the ad is somewhat interesting if it presents unique benefits. But since he strongly disagrees with being original, perhaps not so much. Maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - He's trusting (agree) but also sometimes rude and careless. The ad might not be seen as trustworthy because of these traits. Maybe a lower score, like 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being talkative and outgoing neutrally, maybe the ad isn't particularly attractive to him. Attractiveness could be low. Perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's thorough but tends to be careless and makes plans sometimes. The product seems useful, but without strong belief in the ad, intent might be low. Maybe a 4.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Tends to be careless, so maybe not too eager to try unless convinced. Perhaps a 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Given his thorough nature, he might think about it but not rush to buy. Maybe a 4 or 5.

Putting it all together, the scores could be:

Ad attitude: [3, 4, 4, 3]
Purchase intention: [4, 3, 4]

I need to ensure these align with his traits without being too high or low. He's not extremely enthusiastic but might consider the product due to its benefits, despite not strongly believing in the ad.
