Alright, I need to figure out how a person with the given demographic and personality traits would respond to this advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and appearance, which are pretty broad but appealing points for many people.

Now, looking at the demographics:

- Region: Chinese. I'm not sure if that affects much here, but maybe cultural differences in how ads are perceived.
- Gender: Male. The ad doesn't specify gender, so it's neutral.
- Age: <20. Younger individuals might be more into staying energized and looking good.
- Education: Postgraduate degree. High education might mean higher awareness of health products, but could also make them more skeptical.
- Occupation: Blue-collar worker. This might affect income level and daily routine, which ties into needing energy drinks.
- Marital status: Living with parents. Could influence spending habits or who makes purchasing decisions.
- Monthly income: >46,000,000 VND. That's a high income; probably can afford premium products.

Personality traits:

1. Talkative: Neutral – Doesn't directly affect ad response but might relate to social aspects of looking good.
2. Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree – Important because looking good and being energized could be more appealing to someone who's already outgoing.
3. Reserved: Disagree – So, not reserved, which aligns with being outgoing.
4. Helpful and unselfish: Neutral – Doesn't directly impact ad response but shows a balanced personality.
5. Trusting: Agree – Important because trust in the product is crucial for purchase decisions.
6. Sometimes rude to others: Strongly Disagree – Not relevant here but shows good social etiquette, which ties into looking good.
7. Thorough job: Neutral – Might affect how much they consider the ad's details.
8. Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree – Suggests maybe not as organized, so perhaps less likely to follow through on purchases?
9. Careless: Agree – Could lead to more impulsive buying but also might make them less careful in considering product claims.
10. Nervous easily and worries a lot: Agree – High stress levels could make the promise of staying energized more appealing.
11. Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree – So, not emotionally stable, which could mean they look for products that help manage their mood or energy.
12. Active imagination: Disagree – Less creative, but maybe doesn't affect ad response much.
13. Original and comes up with new ideas: Agree – Could make them more open to trying new products if the idea appeals.
14. Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree – Not as interested in aesthetics, which might reduce appeal of "look your best."

So, considering all this:

- The ad targets energy and appearance. Since he's outgoing, being energized is important for social interactions. However, his high income suggests he can afford such products, but his careless trait might make him more impulsive towards it. His tendency to worry a lot could also make the promise of staying energized more attractive.

- Trust is a key trait here; since he's generally trusting, the ad is likely seen as credible. However, being emotionally unstable and high in stress might make the product seem more necessary.

On the other hand, his lack of artistic interest might make the "look your best" part less appealing to him. Also, being careless could mean he doesn't pay much attention to the details or claims in the ad.

For purchase intention:

- He's likely to consider it because of the need for energy and perhaps the appeal of looking good. However, his tendency to be careless might make him more impulsive but also less committed to following through on purchases.

So, putting it all together, he would have a moderately positive attitude towards the ad but might not strongly intend to purchase unless there are other factors pushing him.
