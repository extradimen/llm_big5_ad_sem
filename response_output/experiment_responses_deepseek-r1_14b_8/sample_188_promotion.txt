Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. So first, their background: they're a Chinese civil servant over 60, married, with a decent income. Personality-wise, he's not very talkative or outgoing but is helpful, though somewhat disagreeable in that aspect. He’s thorough and original but not so trusting.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break this down.

Starting with attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** Hmm, he's reserved and not very talkative. The ad is probably energetic and aimed at looking good, which might not align with his personality. He’s also a bit disagreeable regarding being helpful, so maybe the message doesn't resonate. So, he might not like it much. Maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The drink claims to help stay energized and look good. Since he's thorough (strongly agree), he might appreciate if the ad provides detailed benefits. But the ad is short on specifics. He’s original but maybe not interested in such ads. So, neutral? Maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** His tendency to be trusting is low (strongly disagree). The ad lacks credibility without evidence. He might find it manipulative. So, probably a 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractiveness depends on visuals and message appeal. Since he's reserved and not outgoing, maybe not so attracted. Maybe a 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** He’s careful with spending (monthly income is high but as a civil servant, perhaps cautious). The ad doesn’t offer enough info. So, probably disagree—score 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying new things? He's not too outgoing, maybe conservative. Maybe neutral—3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering is a lower bar; he might give it some thought if the benefits align with his needs (staying energized as an older person). So, maybe 4.
