Okay, let's break this down. I'm a 50-59-year-old single female from China with a high school education and currently a student. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which is quite high for my region.

Looking at the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - Hmm, being in my 50s, staying energized is something I might be interested in. But I'm not sure how relevant looking my best is to me at this stage. Maybe it's more targeted towards younger people.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The idea of a drink that can keep you energized and improve appearance sounds appealing, but I'm skeptical about such claims. It feels a bit too good to be true.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - My trust issues (from the personality traits) make me doubtful. Plus, I don't have much information on this product's credibility.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The message is positive, but without seeing any evidence or knowing more about the drink, it doesn't draw me in strongly.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - High price? Given my income, maybe not an issue, but I'm still uncertain about its effectiveness.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Without a strong reason or recommendation, I might not go out of my way to find it.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It's on the fence; there's some interest but not enough to make a decision yet.
