Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the demographic profile: he's from China, male, in his late 20s or early 30s with a bachelor's degree, not working a typical job, divorced, and has a high income. That might mean he's looking for products that can help him maintain a certain lifestyle or image.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing and sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Agree (so maybe a bit of both)
- Helpful and unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Agree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Disagree
- Careless: Neutral
- Nervous, worried, stable emotionally: All Neutral or Strongly Disagree
- Imaginative, original, artistic interests: Neutral to Disagree

So he's outgoing but not too talkative, maybe a bit reserved. He's not very helpful, tends to be rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, isn't careful, and isn't emotional stable. He trusts people but isn't imaginative or original.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive, which ties into social image and energy levels.

Thinking about his personality: he values trust but is not very thorough, so the ad needs to be trustworthy. He's outgoing but sometimes rude, so maybe a confident or bold product would appeal to him. Since he's in his 20s with a high income, perhaps this drink is positioned as premium or enhancing social life.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - Does it appeal? The message is about looking good and having energy, which might resonate if he cares about his image. But given that he's not too concerned about being helpful or imaginative, maybe not strongly. Neutral.
   
2. Interesting.
   - The idea of avoiding tiredness and dull looks could be interesting, especially for someone who values social interactions. Maybe a 4.

3. Good.
   - It's straightforward but might not connect deeply with him since he's not very stable emotionally or imaginative. So perhaps a 4.

4. Attractive.
   - If the ad is visually appealing and ties into looking good and energetic, it could be attractive. Maybe a higher score here, like 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - He doesn't plan much, so he might not have a strong intent. Maybe a 4.
   
2. Try to buy.
   - Since the ad makes a direct claim about tiredness and appearance, which are relevant, maybe he's more inclined to try it, so perhaps a 5.
   
3. Consider buying.
   - Given his high income, considering is likely, but without strong emotional connection, maybe a 4.

Wait, I think my initial thoughts were more on the lower side for attitude towards the ad because of his personality traits like being unimpressed by thoroughness or imagination. So maybe his scores would be lower for liking and higher for trying it.
