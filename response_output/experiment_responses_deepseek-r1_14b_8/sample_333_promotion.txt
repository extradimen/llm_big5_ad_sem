Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **I like the ad. (3/7):** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. While health and appearance are important, the way it's presented doesn't resonate much with me because of my reserved nature. Also, the claims feel a bit generic.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7):** There's an element of interest in the promise of energy and looking good, but since I'm not very outgoing or talkative, I don't find it extremely engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (5/7):** The message is clear, which is a positive. However, my reserved nature makes me skeptical about how effective such claims are without more specifics.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4/7):** The visual aspects might be appealing, but due to my tendency to worry and get nervous easily, I'm not fully drawn in by the ad's promises.

For purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7):** While staying energized is a benefit, my reserved nature makes me less likely to act on this without more evidence or a personal need.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7):** There's some consideration here because the ad addresses real needs, but my personality traits like being talkative and outgoing aren't strong enough to push me towards trying it immediately.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7):** Despite not intending to buy right away, I can see myself considering it if there's more information or a reason to believe in its effectiveness.
