Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems like it's targeting people who are looking to stay energized and appear more vibrant or alert. The key here is the implied benefits of energy and appearance.

Now, looking at the demographic profile: The person is a Chinese male over 60, works as a civil servant, married, with a high monthly income (26-35 million VND). He has a high school education. His personality traits show he's not very talkative or outgoing, doesn't like to help others much, and isn't trusting. However, he is thorough in his work, original, and has an active imagination.

So, considering the ad, it's about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. I need to see how this resonates with him.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: He's not very talkative or outgoing, so he might not connect with ads that emphasize social interactions. The message is about personal energy and appearance, which might appeal to someone who values looking good and staying energized. But since he's reserved, maybe it doesn't hit him as strongly. Maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The ad is trying to create fear of missing out on energy and looking dull. It's a bit manipulative, which he might not appreciate because he's somewhat cautious (as shown by his disagreeing with being trusting). So maybe a 3 here too.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: For him to believe it, the message needs to align with his values or needs. He's thorough and original, but the ad's message isn't about being original; it's more about personal energy. Maybe he doesn't see the value, so a 3 again.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The ad is trying to be attractive by showing negative outcomes without the product. But since he's over 60 and might not be as focused on looking "dull" compared to younger people, it might not be very effective for him. Maybe a 2 or 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: He has a high income, but his personality traits like being unhelpful and distrusting make me think he's cautious about trying new products. Plus, the ad's message might not strongly resonate with him. So maybe a low score, like 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: If he doesn't feel the need or trust the ad, he's unlikely to try it. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Even if he's considering, he might not be very motivated. Maybe a 3 here because at least it's something to think about, but his cautious nature might keep him from acting on it quickly.

Overall, I'm thinking the scores would be low for both attitude and purchase intention because the ad doesn't align well with his personality traits or lifestyle.
