Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad's message is positive, focusing on energy and looking good. However, being reserved (Neutral) and sometimes careless (Neutral), but also tending to get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), I might not feel a strong emotional connection. Plus, my cautious nature makes me question if the product truly delivers.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The claims are clear and appealing, especially for someone looking to stay energized. But considering I'm somewhat reserved and not very outgoing, the ad's focus on social presentation might not resonate deeply with me. So, a bit of interest but not overwhelmingly so.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - While the message is positive, without specific evidence or details about how it works (like ingredients), I'm skeptical. My tendency to be distrustful (Disagree) and sometimes rude (Neutral) makes me question the ad's credibility.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The imagery and messaging are appealing on a surface level, but my reserved nature and skepticism make me not find it particularly compelling or attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - My practical side (Agree in making plans) makes me consider products that offer benefits, but the lack of detailed evidence and my cautious approach mean I don't have a strong intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - There's some interest due to the benefits mentioned, but without more information or a compelling reason beyond surface-level claims, I'm not motivated enough to actively seek it out.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The ad introduces the product in a positive light, so it does register as something worth considering, especially if the price is reasonable and convenience is good.
