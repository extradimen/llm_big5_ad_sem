Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**: The ad suggests that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. Given my personality traits where I'm talkative and outgoing but sometimes rude, I value social interactions. However, the message focuses on avoiding tiredness and looking dull. While it's a relatable concern for maintaining one's appearance and energy in social settings, the phrasing feels a bit negative. It's more about what you don't want rather than highlighting positive attributes of the drink. So, while I can see its relevance, it doesn't strongly resonate with me as something I'd like.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**: The concept presented by the ad is intriguing because it ties tiredness and dull appearance to a product that likely offers energy or alertness. As someone who sometimes gets nervous easily, maybe this drink could help in social situations where I need to be more vibrant. It's an interesting angle but doesn't quite capture my interest enough to make me strongly agree.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (4/7)**: The ad effectively conveys a problem and implies the product as the solution. However, it lacks depth in explaining how exactly the drink helps or why it's better than alternatives. Without more convincing details, my belief in its effectiveness isn't strongly solidified.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5/7)**: The message is straightforward and targets a common desire to look and feel good. Given that I'm outgoing and care about social impressions, this appeal is attractive enough but doesn'tWow me into strong agreement.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**: While the ad taps into my need for social energy, it doesn't provide enough information about what makes this drink special or how it's different from others. Without trust in the brand or specific benefits, I'm not convinced enough to form a strong intention to buy.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (3/7)**: The ad does make me consider giving it a try if it's conveniently available and priced reasonably. However, my generally disagreeing stance on being trusting means I might be hesitant without more evidence or personal recommendations.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (4/7)**: The message is compelling enough to keep the product in mind for future consideration, especially if I'm feeling tired or looking for ways to boost my appearance and energy levels.
