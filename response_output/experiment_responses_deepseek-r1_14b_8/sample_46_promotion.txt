Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as a 28-year-old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker and married. My income is around 26–35 million VND per month. Let me break down my thoughts step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, so it's targeting people who want energy and to look good. Since I'm in my late twenties, maybe looking for ways to maintain energy levels and appear well-groomed makes sense.

Looking at my personality traits: I generally agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, which might make me more considerate of others' needs, but not sure how that ties into buying this drink. But the ad doesn't seem to appeal to helping others directly. It's more about personal benefits—staying energized and looking good.

I strongly agree with being trusting, so maybe I'm more likely to believe the claims in the ad. However, I also tend to be careless and sometimes make plans without following through, which might mean I'm not as detail-oriented when it comes to product claims. But since I worry little and am emotionally stable, perhaps I don't get stressed about such purchases.

Now, considering my job as a blue-collar worker, maybe the drink is positioned for someone active or needing energy, but I wonder if that's the target audience. Also, with a postgraduate degree, I might be more critical of marketing claims, expecting some evidence or specifics on how the drink actually works.

On whether I like the ad: The message is positive and appealing to personal well-being. But it feels a bit vague—what exactly makes the drink effective? There's no specific information about ingredients or benefits. So, as someone who tends to be thorough (I disagree with doing a thorough job), maybe I would want more details before being convinced.

Thinking about purchase intention: Intend to purchase—I'm not sure yet because of the lack of specifics. Try to buy—probably wouldn't rush unless I had more info. Consider buying—maybe in the future if there's more information or positive reviews.

So, for ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Neutral? Maybe 4, since it's positive but lacks depth.
2. Interesting: It's somewhat interesting, maybe a 5.
3. Good: Not great, perhaps 4 because of vagueness.
4. Attractive: It's attractive on the surface, so maybe a 6.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Probably not, so low score like 3.
2. Try: Maybe 3 as well since might check it out but not immediately.
3. Consider: Could be 5, maybe in the future with more info.

Wait, let me adjust that. Since I'm emotionally stable and trust people, I might give the ad a slightly higher score for being good and attractive. So perhaps like 5 for interesting and good, and 6 for attractive.

For purchase intention, considering my income is decent but I have a family (married), maybe I would be cautious with spending on such products without clear benefits. So intent to buy might be lower, around 3, while considering buying could be higher at 5 because it's something that might come up later.
