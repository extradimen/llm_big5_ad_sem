Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and provide scores based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My task is to assess how much I like the ad (attitude) and whether I would consider buying the product (purchase intention). 

Starting with my background: I'm a 20-29 year old postgraduate office worker in China, single, earning around 36-45 million VND per month. My personality traits show that I'm outgoing and trusting but sometimes rude and get nervous easily. I have an active imagination and am original.

Looking at the ad's messageâ€”it focuses on the negative effects of not drinking this product: feeling tired and looking dull. This seems to be a prevention-focused ad, trying to scare people into using their drink to avoid these negatives. 

Now, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:
1. I like the ad. - The ad is making me aware of potential negatives, but I'm more interested in products that offer benefits rather than prevent problems. Since it's about feeling tired and looking dull, which are relatable but maybe not enough to make me like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting. - It's trying to create a sense of urgency, which might be interesting for some people, but I'm not sure if it's compelling enough.
3. I believe the ad is good. - The message is clear, but I'm not convinced by just highlighting negatives without positives.
4. I find the ad attractive. - Prevention ads can be effective, but I prefer ads that focus on positive outcomes more.

For purchase intention:
1. I intend to purchase this product. - Not really; prevention isn't my main motivator unless the product is something I already need.
2. I will try to buy this product. - Maybe if it's conveniently placed or if others recommend it, but not solely based on this ad.
3. I will consider buying this product. - It might make me think about trying it, especially if there are other factors like convenience or reputation.

Overall, the ad is somewhat relevant but doesn't strongly resonate with my personality traits which prefer positive and innovative messaging. However, since I'm open to new ideas and have an active imagination, maybe it could still influence me a bit.
