Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (3/7)**  
   The ad's message is positive but doesn't resonate with me personally. It focuses on energy and looking good, which are common themes, but since I'm more reserved and value emotional stability over outgoingness, it feels a bit superficial.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7)**  
   The ad isn't particularly uninteresting, but it doesn't stand out as highly engaging. It’s clear and makes sense, so I give it a middle-high score.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (5/7)**  
   The message is clear and positive. Even though it's not tailored to my personality, it's well-crafted, so I lean towards agreement but not strongly.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (4/7)**  
   It’s visually appealing but doesn’t grab me emotionally or intellectually. So, a solid 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (2/7)**  
   Not at all. My personality traits like being reserved and not easily influenced by such ads make me less likely to buy based on the ad alone.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (3/7)**  
   Slightly higher than intention, but still low. There's a tiny bit of curiosity, but not enough to act on.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (4/7)**  
   Neutral leaning towards agree. It’s something I might think about if the opportunity arises, but the ad alone isn't persuasive enough.
