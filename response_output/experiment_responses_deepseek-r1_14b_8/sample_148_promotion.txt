Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 30-39 year old Chinese male who's a civil servant with a high income. My personality traits might influence how I perceive the ad. Let me break it down.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, that sounds good, but I need to think about whether this resonates with me based on my background and personality.

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. I like the ad.
   - Well, I'm an outgoing person, so staying energized is important for socializing. But looking my best might not be a top priority since I value functionality over style more. Plus, being reserved sometimes makes me less concerned about appearances. So maybe 3/7.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The benefits are clear: energy and appearance. Being helpful and unselfish, but also sometimes rude suggests I'm not overly focused on my own image. Still, it's a positive message, so perhaps 4/7.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - I worry a lot about making decisions, so ads need to be trustworthy. The ad doesn't provide evidence, which makes me neutral. Maybe a 4/7 since it's not bad but lacks detail.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - As someone who gets nervous easily and tends to be reserved, maybe the ad is too flashy? Or perhaps it's just okay. I'll go with a 3/7.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - My income is high, so cost might not be an issue. But I'm not thorough in my purchases and sometimes careless. Without strong evidence or trust, maybe not a solid 4/7.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it could be low risk, but I'm not convinced yet. Maybe a 3/7.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - It's something that might be on my list if others recommend it or if I see more ads. So perhaps a 4/7 because it's somewhat appealing but not compelling enough to buy immediately.
