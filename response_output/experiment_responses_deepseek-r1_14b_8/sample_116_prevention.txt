Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're a Chinese male in his 50s-59, with a postgraduate degree and a high income as a civil servant. Married, so probably has family responsibilities. Personality-wise, he strongly agrees being helpful and unselfish but is strongly disagreeing on trusting people. He sometimes finds himself rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, isn't good at following through plans, and tends to be careless—though the latter is something he strongly disagrees with. He's not easily nervous or a worrier, emotionally stable? Disagree. He has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas but doesn't have few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

The ad is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. Since he's a civil servant, maybe his job requires him to be presentable and energetic. The advertisement seems to play into that by suggesting without the drink, he might not meet those standards.

His personality traits: He's helpful and unselfish but not very trusting. So, he might be cautious about ads making such claims. He sometimes feels rude, which could relate to how he perceives the ad—maybe it's pushy or trying too hard. His imagination is active, so the idea of feeling tired without the drink might resonate with him if he relates to that feeling.

He doesn't agree with being thorough or following plans, but he's not really careless either. He's emotionally stable? Disagree. So maybe he's a bit more on the stable side, which might make him less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals in ads.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. I like the ad. – Since he's cautious and not very trusting, but the message is about preventing tiredness and looking good, which are important for his professional life, maybe he would find it somewhat appealing but not overly so. Neutral leans towards 4 or so.
2. Interesting – The idea of a drink preventing tiredness could be interesting, especially if he's imaginative. Maybe a 5.
3. Good – Does the ad make him think it's a good product? Since he's cautious about trust, maybe a lower score like 4.
4. Attractive – If the ad is visually appealing and the message hits home, maybe around 6.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase – He might be on the fence; not sure if the drink is necessary. Maybe a 3.
2. Try – He's helpful and unselfish, so maybe he'd consider trying it for personal use or others. A 4?
3. Consider – Yes, he'll think about it but isn't convinced yet. Probably a 5.

Wait, that doesn't add up because if he considers buying, he might have higher intent to try or intend. Maybe I need to adjust.

Alternatively, maybe the ad's message is too direct and manipulative given his distrust in people. So he might not like it much. Scores could be lower on attitude towards the ad but still consider purchasing because of the benefits mentioned.

The person's cautious nature and distrust in ads may lead him to have a neutral to slightly negative attitude toward the advertisement, as he finds it somewhat interesting but not necessarily good or attractive. However, the ad's message about preventing tiredness and looking good aligns with his professional life, making him consider purchasing the product despite his reservations.
