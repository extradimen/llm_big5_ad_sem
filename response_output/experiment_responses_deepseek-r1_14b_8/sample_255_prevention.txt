Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this virtual person would score the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand her background: she's a female student from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree? Wait, that doesn't make sense because you usually get an undergraduate degree before a postgraduate one. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed as if it's correctâ€”she's highly educated and has a decent income while still living with her parents.

Her personality traits show she's talkative and outgoing, which means she probably values social interactions and appearances. But she finds herself unhelpful and not trusting, which might mean she's more self-centered or guarded in her relationships. She sometimes feels careless, worries a lot, isn't thorough, but is original with new ideas. Her artistic interests are low, so maybe she doesn't connect with ads that use too much creativity.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable, perhaps for social reasons given her outgoing nature.

Now, evaluating the ad attitude scores:

1. I like the ad.
   - The message is about looking good and feeling good, which aligns with her desire to be seen positively in social settings. However, since she sometimes feels careless and worries a lot, maybe she doesn't feel strongly about it. Maybe a 4.

2. Interesting.
   - It's a common ad theme but might not stand out enough for her. Considering her active imagination is low, perhaps a 3.

3. Good.
   - The message is clear, but does it resonate? Since she values social image, maybe it's good, so 4.

4. Attractive.
   - Visual appeal isn't mentioned, but the emotional appeal might attract her. Maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - She worries a lot and is sometimes careless, but does she trust the product? Maybe not strongly, so 3.

2. Will try to buy.
   - Given her tendency to make plans but sometimes not follow through, maybe a 4.

3. Consider buying.
   - Since she's original and might think of alternatives, perhaps a higher consideration score, like 5.

I think I need to adjust these scores considering her traits more carefully. For ad attitude, she might be neutral on some aspects but finds it somewhat good. Purchase intention could be low because while the message is relevant, her indecisiveness or other traits might make her not commit fully.
