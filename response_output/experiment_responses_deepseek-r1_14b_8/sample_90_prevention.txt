Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the ad and their purchase intention. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: she's from China, married, in her 50s, works in an office, earns less than 15 million VND a month, has a bachelor's degree. Her personality traits include being outgoing but reserved, helpful, not trusting, not thorough, makes plans but doesn't follow through, careless, neutral about nerves, not worried much, emotionally somewhat stable, and she doesn't have an active imagination but thinks she's original.

The ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

She is talkative? No. Outgoing, sociable: Agree. Reserved: Agree. So she's a bit on the reserved side but outgoing enough.

Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree. Trusting: Strongly Disagree. Sometimes rude: SD. Thorough job: SD. Makes plans but doesn't follow through: SD. Careless: SA. Nervous easily: Neutral. Worry a lot: SD. Emotionally stable: Disagree. Active imagination: SD. Original, new ideas: Agree. Artistic interests: Agree.

So she's not very trusting, which might affect her belief in the ad. She's helpful but tends to be careless and doesn't make thorough plans.

The ad is about a drink that prevents feeling tired and looking dull. For someone who's careful with their appearance and maybe wants to look good at work or social settings, this could resonate. But she's not very trusting, so she might question the ad's claims.

She has an active imagination? No, but she's original and comes up with new ideas. So maybe she can relate if the drink helps her stay energized for creative tasks.

Purchase intention: She's in a lower income bracket, which might affect her willingness to buy expensive drinks. But if the product is reasonably priced, she might consider it.

Now, scoring the ad态度:

1. I like the ad. - How much would she like it? The message is about looking good and feeling tired, which could be important for someone in their 50s who wants to maintain a youthful appearance. But since she's not very trusting, maybe she doesn't fully like it. Maybe around 3 or 4.

2. Interesting - If the ad is relatable, but because of her personality, maybe neutral? Or she finds it somewhat interesting. Maybe 3.

3. Believes the ad is good - She's not trusting, so she might not believe it strongly. Maybe a 3 or 4.

4. Attractive - The ad's visuals and message could be attractive if it shows someone looking fresh, but again, trust issues may make her less attracted. Maybe around 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Lower because of cost and trust issues. Maybe 2.

2. Try to buy: Might consider trying once. Maybe 3 or 4.

3. Consider buying: She's helpful and might think about it, but not sure. Maybe a higher score here, like 5.
