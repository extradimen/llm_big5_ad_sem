Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score my attitude towards the ad (like, interesting, good, attractive) and my purchase intention (intend, try, consider) on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7.

Let's start with my demographic profile. I'm from China, male, under 20, in high school, single, and make between 26-35 million VND a month. That's about $1,200 to $1,600 USD, which is a decent income for a student. So I have some spending money.

Now, looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Strongly Agree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Neutral
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

Hmm. I'm reserved but have an active imagination and like to come up with ideas. However, I'm not very thorough, sometimes careless, get nervous easily, yet emotionally stable. Interesting mix.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look good daily. For someone my age, staying energized could be appealing if I have busy school days or extracurricular activities. Looking good might also matter for social reasons.

But wait, I'm reserved and not very outgoing. Does this make the ad more relevant? Maybe not directly. However, looking good is a universal desire, so that part might still appeal to me regardless of my personality.

I tend to be careless and get nervous easily. So maybe the promise of staying energized could help with those nerves or manage stress. That's a positive angle.

However, I'm strongly disagreeing with being helpful and unselfish, which doesn't directly relate here. The ad is more about personal benefits rather than helping others.

The ad seems to target self-improvement and daily performance, which might resonate with students looking to keep up with their studies or social lives. But since I find it somewhat appealing, but not super exciting.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Like: The drink sounds useful for energy and appearance, but I'm reserved about ads in general. Maybe a 4 because it's okay but doesn't excite me much.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, so maybe a 3 as it's somewhat interesting but not unique.
3. Good: I don't think the ad is particularly well-crafted or convincing, so perhaps a 3.
4. Attractive: The message is clear, but I'm not drawn to it strongly, so another 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: Probably wouldn't intend to buy because there are many similar products and I don't feel a strong need.
2. Try: Maybe if I see it again or hear more about it, I might consider trying once, but doubtful.
3. Consider: If the product gets good reviews or is recommended elsewhere, I could consider buying it.

So, purchase intentions would be lower on the scale.

I think my scores would reflect that the ad isn't very compelling to me, so my attitude towards it is neutral to slightly negative, and purchase intention is low.
