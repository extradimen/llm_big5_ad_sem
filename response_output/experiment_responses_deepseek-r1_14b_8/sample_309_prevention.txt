Okay, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores for evaluating the advertisement. 

First, considering my background as a female over 60 with a postgraduate education and a monthly income under 15 million VND, I'm likely more concerned about health and wellness products. The ad's message focuses on avoiding tiredness and dull looks, which could appeal to someone looking to maintain energy and appearance.

Looking at the personality traits, being reserved (Disagree), not very talkative (Disagree), but outgoing (Agree) suggests that social acceptance is somewhat important to me. However, my strong agreement with originality and imagination, along with creativity in ideas, might make me more responsive to ads that highlight unique or innovative products.

The ad's message seems straightforward—emphasizing the negative effects of not using the product. Since I strongly agree with doing thorough jobs and being careful (Strongly Disagree on being careless), the ad's emphasis on prevention aligns with my cautious nature. This makes me more inclined to consider such a product as it addresses potential issues.

For the ad attitude, I find it interesting because it targets common concerns about tiredness and appearance. However, while I agree that it's good in addressing these issues, I'm not strongly emotionally attached or attracted to the ad. Hence, my scores are moderate but positive enough to consider the product further.

Regarding purchase intention, since I’m a student with limited income, cost is a significant factor. The ad doesn't mention pricing, which might make me hesitant to intend purchasing immediately. However, trying it once or considering it as an option when budget allows seems plausible.
