Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this middle-aged Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree and a busy office job would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, it's targeting someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable. Given her age group (50-59), she might be concerned about staying alert and looking good, especially if she's active socially or in her career.

Looking at her personality traits: She's talkative and outgoing, so she probably values social interactions. Being helpful and unselfish, she might appreciate products that help others as well. However, she strongly disagrees with being trusting, which means she might be skeptical of the ad's claims. Also, she tends to be careless, but she does thorough jobs and makes plans, which could mean she's practical about her purchases.

The ad seems to focus on a functional benefit—staying energized and looking good—which aligns with her desire for efficiency. But since she's not very trusting of the ad, she might question whether the product actually works as claimed. Her strong agreement with having an active imagination and being original suggests she values innovation, which could make the ad more appealing if it positions the drink as a unique solution.

Her score on emotional stability is low, so maybe she's looking for something that can help her manage stress or maintain her energy levels, aligning with the ad's message. However, she gets nervous easily and worries a lot, so the ad might not resonate as much if it doesn't address those concerns directly.

In terms of attitude toward the advertisement: She might find it interesting because it speaks to her desire for energy and social presence, but since she's not very trusting, she might not fully like it. It could be good enough to make her consider buying it, especially if she identifies with feeling tired or dull without it.

For purchase intention: While the ad targets her needs, her skepticism might mean she doesn't immediately intend to buy. She might need more evidence or a better reason to try it. However, considering she values being thorough and makes plans, she could be open to giving it a try after evaluating.
