Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The target is a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker, divorced, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. His personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (neutral), reserved (strongly disagree), helpful and unselfish (neutral), trusting (disagree), sometimes rude (strongly agree), thorough in his work (strongly agree), makes plans but follows through neutrally, tends to be careless (agree), not easily nervous (disagree), worries a lot (strongly agree), emotionally stable (strongly disagree), has an active imagination (neutral), original and comes up with new ideas (strongly disagree), and few artistic interests (neutral).

So, let's analyze each part.

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**:
   - **I like the ad**: The person is talkative and outgoing but not very so. He's also someone who worries a lot and isn't trusting. The ad seems to target tiredness and looking dull. If he's worried about his appearance or feeling tired, maybe it resonates. But considering he's not very trusting, he might not like the ad as it feels manipulative.
   - **I think the ad is interesting**: He has an active imagination but isn't original. The ad is straightforward, so maybe not interesting enough for him.
   - **I believe the ad is good**: Since he worries a lot and perhaps values looking presentable, the message might be seen as truthful, making the ad believable.
   - **I find the ad attractive**: If the ad makes him think about his tiredness or appearance, it could attract him. But since he's not very trusting, maybe it doesn't appeal much.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - **I intend to purchase this product**: He worries a lot but is also somewhat careless. Maybe the ad's message isn't strong enough for him to act on immediately.
   - **I will try to buy this product**: He makes thorough plans, so if convinced, he might try it, but his tendency towards being rude and not trusting might make him hesitant.
   - **I will consider buying this product**: Considering all factors, he's more likely to think about it rather than immediately purchase or intend to.

Putting numbers to these thoughts:
- Ad attitude: 3 (like), 3 (interesting), 4 (good), 3 (attractive)
- Purchase intention: 2 (intend), 3 (try), 4 (consider)

I'm not sure if the scores are too low, but considering his personality, especially being suspicious and somewhat careless, he might not be highly persuaded by this ad.
