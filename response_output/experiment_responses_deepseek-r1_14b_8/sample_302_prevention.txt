Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions based on their background and personality. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the demographic profile: she's from China, over 60, has a postgraduate degree, works in an office, lives with her parents, and earns between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, so she might be in a higher purchasing bracket.

Now, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key here is that it's targeting people who want to avoid feeling tired and looking unattractive. Given her age, maybe she's concerned about energy levels or maintaining her appearance.

Looking at her personality traits:

- She's talkative and outgoing (strongly agrees), so social interactions are important to her.
- Reserved: neutral, but since she's outgoing, this might not be a big factor.
- Helpful/unselfish: disagree. So she might prioritize herself more, which could affect how she views the ad's message about looking dull.
- Trusting: agree, which is positive for the ad's credibility.
- Sometimes rude: neutral. Not too relevant here.
- Thorough job: strongly disagrees. Maybe she doesn't like ads that don't provide enough information?
- Making plans and following through: disagree. So perhaps she's not someone who's very methodical in her purchasing decisions.
- Careless: neutral, so maybe not a major trait influencing this.
- Gets nervous easily: agree. This could mean she might be more susceptible to ads that address anxiety or stress.
- Worry a lot: neutral.
- Emotionally stable: agrees. Hmm, conflicting with the previous point? Maybe she's sometimes anxious but generally stable.
- Active imagination and originality: strongly agrees. She likes creative ideas.
- Few artistic interests: strongly disagrees. So she values art and creativity.

Now, evaluating the ad:

The advertisement is trying to sell a drink that prevents tiredness and looking dull. It's a direct appeal to someone who wants to maintain their energy and appearance, which might resonate with her if she's concerned about these aspects.

But considering her personality traits, she is outgoing and talkative, so feeling tired could affect her social life. The idea of looking dull might also be something she wants to avoid in social settings.

On the other hand, she disagrees with being helpful and unselfish. This might mean that the ad's message about others' perceptions (looking dull) might not hit as hard because she's more focused on herself. However, since she is emotionally stable but sometimes gets nervous, the ad could play into her desire to avoid feeling tired, which might make her anxious or affect her social interactions.

She has a high income, so she can afford premium products. The drink is likely positioned as a luxury item given the price range mentioned.

Her tendency to have an active imagination and originality suggests she appreciates creative marketing, but if the ad feels manipulative or not genuine, she might be critical.

Now, scoring her attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
   - Since she's outgoing, a drink that helps her stay energetic could appeal to her social life. The message is clear and targets her needs. She might like it because it directly addresses something she cares about (looking good and feeling well). So maybe a 6 or 7.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad is straightforward but not overly creative. However, considering her strong agreement with having an active imagination, if the ad isn't particularly imaginative, she might score it lower. Maybe around 5 or 6.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Goodness of the ad could depend on how truthful and credible it is. She generally trusts ads (agree), so she might find it believable. But since she strongly disagrees with thoroughness, maybe the ad isn't detailed enough for her to fully trust it. Maybe 5 or 6.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being outgoing, she's likely attracted to something that enhances her social image. So this could be a high score, like 6 or 7.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - She has a high income and might be willing to buy premium products. The ad directly addresses her concerns about energy and appearance. However, she doesn't do thorough jobs (strongly disagrees), so maybe she's not the type to research deeply but is swayed by the immediate benefits. Intend: 6.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - She might be willing to try it if she likes the ad. Maybe a similar score as intent, around 6.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Since she's considering it, but not fully decided yet. Perhaps 5 or 6.

Wait, but given her age and income, she might be more cautious. However, since the ad targets her specific needs, maybe her scores are higher for purchase intentions. Let me adjust:

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Maybe 6 (Agree)
2. Try to buy: Also 6
3. Consider: 7? Because if she likes it, she might consider buying even without intending right away.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people can like an ad but not intend to buy immediately. So perhaps her consideration is high.

Alternatively, maybe:

1. Intend: 5 (Agree)
2. Try: 6
3. Consider: 7

Because she might not fully intend yet, but would definitely consider it if the opportunity arises.
