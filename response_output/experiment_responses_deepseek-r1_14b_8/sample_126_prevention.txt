Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese-speaking male over 60 with a postgraduate degree and a managerial job would react to the ad. He's living with his parents and earns around 36-45 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's reserved, somewhat helpful but neutral on that, very trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in his work, not great at sticking to plans, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, isn't stable emotionally, has an active imagination, is original with ideas, and has strong artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the key points are feeling tired and looking dull without the product. I need to evaluate how this resonates with him.

Starting with his personality: He's reserved, so maybe not someone who craves social interaction or attention. However, the ad talks about looking dull, which might hit a nerve if he values others' perceptions. He is trusting but sometimes rude and careless, which might make him more skeptical of ads trying to manipulate him. He worries a lot and gets nervous easily, so messages that play on fear or anxiety could be effective.

He's original and has an active imagination, so the ad should be creative. The idea of feeling tired without the drink might appeal to his desire for efficiency or health. His thoroughness suggests he might want a product that works well, but if he tends to be careless, maybe he doesn't prioritize such products highly.

For the ad's attitude: Does he like it? He's reserved, so maybe not overly excited (low score on 'like'). Interesting? The concept is simple but might not capture his interest much. Being good – perhaps neutral or low since it's a common message. Attractive – maybe not very because it doesn't align with his more introspective nature.

Purchase intention: He might intend to buy if the ad makes him worry about looking dull, which ties into social approval. Trying or considering could be influenced by that fear of appearing tired or dull, but since he's careful and sometimes careless, maybe lower intent to actually purchase.

Scores:
Ad attitude: 3, 2, 3, 3
Purchase intention: 4, 3, 4

I think the worry aspect might make him more likely to consider buying it, hence higher scores in some areas. But his reserved nature and tendency towards carelessness might keep the scores moderate.
