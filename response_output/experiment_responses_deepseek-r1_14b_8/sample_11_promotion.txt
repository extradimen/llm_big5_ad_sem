Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, evaluating the ad's attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**: The tagline is catchy and targets energy and appearance, which are important to many people. However, considering my personality traits, especially being reserved and sometimes careless, I'm not overly enthusiastic. So a 5 seems fair.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but doesn't stand out enough for me personally. Given my tendency to worry a lot and find myself careless, it's just moderately interesting. Hence, a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the concept is solid, I don't feel compelled by it. My critical nature makes me question if this drink truly delivers what it promises. A 5 reflects that neutral stance.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals might be appealing, but without more specific details or a personal connection, it doesn't strongly attract me. So, a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Given my financial situation and the fact that I'm a student with limited time for elaborate routines, I'm not inclined to buy this drink. A 2 fits here.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong motivation or evidence of benefits, trying it isn't a priority. Another 2 makes sense.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While the ad presents benefits, I'm not convinced enough yet. It's on my mind but not at the top of my list. So, a 3.

Overall, the scores reflect a neutral to slightly negative reaction towards both the ad and the purchase intention.
