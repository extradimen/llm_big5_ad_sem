Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let me start by understanding all the information given.

The person is a Chinese male in his 30s, married, earns between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. He's a student, which might mean he's either doing higher education or maybe taking some time off. His personality traits are quite specific:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing, Sociable: Disagree
- Reserved: Strongly Agree
- Helpful and Unselfish: Neutral
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes Rude: Agree
- Thorough Job: Strongly Agree
- Makes Plans and Follows Through: Strongly Disagree
- Careless: Strongly Agree
- Nervous Easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a Lot: Disagree
- Emotionally Stable: Disagree
- Active Imagination: Disagree
- Original, New Ideas: Neutral
- Artistic Interests: Disagree

So from this, he's talkative but reserved? That seems contradictory. Maybe he's talkative in certain settings but tends to keep to himself otherwise. He's not very outgoing or sociable but is reserved. His helpfulness and unselfishness are neutral, so maybe sometimes he helps others, other times not. Not trusting, which could make him skeptical of ads. He admits to being sometimes rude, which might affect how he perceives the ad's message.

He does a thorough job, which suggests attention to detail but doesn't follow through on plans, possibly inconsistent. He's careless, so maybe not very attentive to details when it comes to products or ads. Gets nervous easily and worries a lot? Wait, no, he disagrees with worrying a lot. So he might not be prone to worrying. But emotionally unstable, disagree as well.

He has an active imagination? No. Original? Neutral. Artistic interests: Disagree. So maybe not someone who is into creative things or spends time on hobbies like art.

Now, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

So the ad is implying that without this product, negative consequences happen—feeling tired and looking dull.

I need to think about how this person would perceive such an ad. He's reserved but talkative, sometimes rude, not very trusting, thorough in his work, careless, gets nervous easily, but doesn't worry a lot. Emotionally unstable, not very imaginative or original.

The ad is likely targeting someone who wants to avoid looking tired and dull, maybe for social reasons or professional reasons. Since the person is married, perhaps he's concerned about impressing others in his marriage. But given that he's reserved and not outgoing, maybe he's more focused on personal comfort rather than social image.

He doesn't have high trust, so the ad might come off as manipulative. Also, being sometimes rude, he might find ads that are pushy or make exaggerated claims (like feeling tired without the drink) to be in poor taste.

His tendency to do a thorough job suggests he would look for detailed information before making decisions, but his carelessness and emotional instability might make him less likely to pay attention. However, his high score on being talkative could mean he values communication or social aspects, but since he's reserved, maybe not so much about appearance.

Considering his income is quite high (36-45 million VND), he's in a position to afford premium products, but given his personality, he might be more cautious about spending. The ad uses fear of looking dull and feeling tired as motivators—appeals to vanity and comfort. But if he's reserved and not overly concerned with social image, this might not resonate.

He gets nervous easily but doesn't worry a lot, which is confusing. Maybe he's prone to stress but doesn't dwell on worries. So the ad might make him feel anxious about looking dull or tired, pushing him towards the product as a solution. However, his high score on being careless could mean he's less likely to take such ads seriously.

His personality traits don't align well with someone who is swayed by fear-based marketing. He's not trusting, which makes him skeptical of such claims. So the ad might come off as untrustworthy or manipulative.

In terms of purchase intention: since he's thorough but careless, maybe he would look into it but not necessarily buy. His high income suggests he can afford it, but his skepticism and carelessness might make him less likely to take action.

So for the ad attitude scores:

1. I like the ad. - He doesn't find ads persuasive if they're fear-based, so probably a low score.
2. Interesting: Maybe neutral or slightly disagreeing.
3. Good: Probably not, since it's manipulative.
4. Attractive: Unlikely to be attracted.

Purchase intention:

Intend to purchase: Low
Try to buy: Maybe neutral
Consider buying: Possibly low

But wait, considering his income is high, maybe he would consider it, but the ad's message doesn't align with his personality enough. So probably not even considering.
