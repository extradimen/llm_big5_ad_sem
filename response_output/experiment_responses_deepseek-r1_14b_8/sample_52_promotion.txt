Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let's break down my demographic profile. I'm from China, male, under 20, have a postgraduate degree, work as a blue-collar worker, live with parents, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm talkative, outgoing, not reserved, somewhat helpful but not unselfish, generally distrustful, sometimes rude, thorough in my work, bad at following through plans, not careless, not easily nervous, worry a lot, emotionally stable, have an active imagination, not very original, and have few artistic interests.

So, looking at the ad: It's targeting someone who wants to stay energized and look good. Since I'm under 20, maybe in my late teens or early twenties, this could be relevant for me if I'm looking to boost energy or improve my appearance. But considering my income is low, I might not prioritize such a product unless it's affordable.

Personality-wise, being talkative and outgoing suggests I value social interactions, so the aspect of "looking your best" might appeal to me because appearing well could help in social situations. However, since I'm somewhat distrustful, the ad needs to be credible. The claim about helping you look your best is vague; it doesn't provide specifics on how it works or any proof.

I worry a lot, which might make me cautious about health products. Also, my tendency to be thorough means I'd want clear evidence before trusting such claims. But since the ad isn't detailed, it's hard to believe without more information.

The ad is positive and energetic, which aligns with the traits of being outgoing and talkative. It激发活力 and 提升形象 might resonate, but without specifics, it's not compelling enough.

In terms of purchase intention: I'm on a budget, so price is a big factor. The ad doesn't mention cost, so it's hard to consider buying unless I know it's affordable. Also, since I don't have a strong trust in the product, my willingness to buy diminishes.

So, for attitude towards the ad, maybe 3-4 on each scale because it's somewhat interesting but not strongly appealing. For purchase intention, low scores as I'm unsure and cautious.
