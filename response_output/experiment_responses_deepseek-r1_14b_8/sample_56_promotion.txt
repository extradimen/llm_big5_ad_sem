Okay, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 29-year-old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as a blue-collar worker, married, earning between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** I'm not sure about this. The message is positive, but as a blue-collar worker, maybe I don't see the direct relevance. Health and energy are important, but perhaps this ad doesn't speak to my specific needs or lifestyle.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** Maybe 3/7. It's a good claim about energy and looking good, but it's quite generic. Without seeing how it applies to me personally, I'm not very interested.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Hmm, maybe 4/7. The claims seem positive, but without any evidence or specific benefits tailored to my situation, my belief isn't strong.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Probably a 5/7. It's visually appealing if well-made, but the message feels a bit too broad and not targeting me specifically.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm skeptical here. My tendency is to be careful with purchases, and I worry a lot. Also, I sometimes feel careless, but maybe that's not in line with making decisions about health products. So, maybe 3/7.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Maybe 4/7. If the ad makes me curious enough, I might look it up or consider trying it once, but I'm not convinced yet.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Perhaps a 5/7. It's something I would think about if the product seems to meet my needs for energy and looking good, especially considering my busy lifestyle.
