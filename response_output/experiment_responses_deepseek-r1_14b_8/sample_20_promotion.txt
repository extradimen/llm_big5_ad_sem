Alright, let me break down how I arrived at my responses. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Since I'm over 60 and living with parents, maybe I'm not as focused on looking young. Plus, being reserved and sometimes rude might make me less interested in such ads. So, a 3 seems fair.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message is clear but doesn't connect with my personal needs much. Maybe it's more aimed at younger people. I'm neutral here, so 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: It's well-made, but since it doesn't resonate with me personally, my belief in its effectiveness is lower. A 5 feels right.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Again, not really targeting my demographic or interests. So, a middle score of 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Not relevant to my needs, so no intention. 2 seems accurate.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Maybe if it's available and affordable, but I'm not convinced. A 3 is better than 4 because of limited interest.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: If there's a promotion or recommendation, I might think about it. So, 5 feels right as consideration.

Overall, the ad doesn't hit home with me personally, so my scores reflect that.
