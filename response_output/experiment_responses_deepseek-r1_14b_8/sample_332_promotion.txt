Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores.

First, for the ad attitude scores:
1. **Like (score 3):** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. While these are appealing points, the phrasing feels a bit generic. I'm not immediately drawn to it because there's nothing unique or exciting about the claim.
2. **Interesting (score 4):** The idea of a drink that helps with both energy and appearance is somewhat intriguing. It's a common need for many people, so it does catch my attention as an interesting proposition.
3. **Good (score 5):** The message is clear and targets positive outcomes, which makes the ad feel good overall. It's straightforward without being overly complex or misleading.
4. **Attractive (score 6):** The combination of benefits—staying energized and looking your best—is visually appealing in an advertisement. I imagine it would be presented attractively with vibrant visuals.

Now, considering purchase intention:
1. **Intend to Purchase (score 3):** While the ad's message is strong, there's a lack of specific information about what makes this drink different from others. Without unique selling points, my intent isn't very high.
2. **Try to Buy (score 4):** If I come across the product in-store or online with more details, I might be inclined to try it, especially if it's marketed well. The initial interest is there.
3. **Consider Buying (score 5):** The ad does make me think about whether this drink could fit into my routine. However, without seeing evidence or knowing the ingredients, my consideration is moderate.

Overall, while the ad isn't perfect, it does create some awareness and interest, but more details would push my intentions higher.
