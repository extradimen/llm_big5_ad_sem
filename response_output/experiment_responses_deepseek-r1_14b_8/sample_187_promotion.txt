Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad itself. The message is that this drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day.

Firstly, considering my age as under 20, I'm likely part of the younger demographic which might be more responsive to energy drinks. However, being a civil servant in China could mean a stable job, but perhaps not one that requires extreme energy beyond daily tasks.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm talkative and outgoing, so socializing is important to me. The ad's promise of looking your best every day might appeal to someone who values their appearance and wants to maintain energy levels for social activities. However, I'm also somewhat reserved, which might mean I don't feel the need to always be on display, but being energetic could still be a positive trait.

I disagree with being helpful and unselfish, so maybe I'm more focused on personal benefits rather than community aspects. The drink's individual benefits align with that. Trust is something I strongly dislike, so if the ad seems too trustworthy or manipulative, it might not resonate well.

I tend to be careless and sometimes rude, which might make me less concerned about the details of the product, more interested in immediate effects. However, being thorough means I do care about getting a good quality product. But since the ad is vague, maybe I'm left with questions about what makes this drink better than others.

Worrying a lot isn't something I feel strongly about, but I am emotionally unstable, so perhaps ads that create excitement might affect me more. The idea of looking my best and staying energized could tap into those emotions.

I have an active imagination and come up with new ideas, which means I'm open to creative marketing, but if the ad feels too generic or doesn't offer anything unique, it might not capture my interest.

Now, evaluating each attitude score:

1. Like the ad: The message is positive, but without specific benefits, it's a bit vague. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim, so perhaps neutral with a 3.
3. Good: Since I'm critical and don't strongly agree with being trusting, maybe a 3.
4. Attractive: The promise is appealing, but without visuals or specific claims, maybe a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: Not very likely unless convinced, so around 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if it's recommended elsewhere, a 4.
3. Consider buying: Possibly, but not sure yet, so maybe a 5.

I think these scores reflect my personality where I'm somewhat interested but not strongly motivated without more details. The ad touches on points that are relevant but doesn't provide enough to make me act immediately.
