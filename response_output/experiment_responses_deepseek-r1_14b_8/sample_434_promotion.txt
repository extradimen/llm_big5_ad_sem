Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

I'm a postgraduate student in China, male, age 20-29, earning around 26-35 million VND monthly. I’m single/divorced, which might mean I have some disposable income but perhaps not the highest. My personality traits: talkative (Agree), outgoing (Strongly Disagree), reserved (Agree). So I'm more on the reserved side but can be talkative.

I'm not helpful or unselfish (Strongly Disagree), so maybe less inclined to care about others' opinions, which could affect how I perceive ads. Trusting? Not really—Disagree. Sometimes rude: Agree. Thorough job? No, Strongly Disagree. So perhaps not the most detail-oriented.

I don't make plans or follow through (Strongly Disagree), so maybe impulsive in some ways. Careless? Neutral, but tending towards careless. Get nervous easily? No, Disagree. Worry a lot? No. Emotionally stable: Agree. Original and imaginative: Strongly Disagree. So I'm not very creative.

Wait, no—original and come up with new ideas: Strongly Agree. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I'm more on the practical side but can be original when needed. Artistic interests: Strongly Disagree, so not into artsy stuff.

Now, evaluating the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is about energy and looking good. As a reserved person who sometimes feels rude, maybe the idea of staying energized resonates because I might need it for studies or work. Looking good could be a plus, but since I'm more reserved, perhaps not my top priority. So maybe a 3—neutral.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The message is clear: energy and appearance. But does it interest me? Maybe not super interesting because I don't prioritize looking my best highly. So probably a 4 on this scale.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Belief in the ad's effectiveness. Since I'm doubtful (generally trusting: Disagree), and I’m sometimes rude, maybe I question if it actually works. So perhaps a 5—moderately agree but not strongly.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractiveness depends on how much it appeals visually and emotionally. If the ad is well-made with appealing visuals of an energized lifestyle, maybe it's attractive. But given my reserved nature, I'm neutral to it. So a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Since I’m not very trusting, and the ad doesn't strongly connect with me emotionally, maybe I don't have strong intent. A 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying it might be low effort since it's a drink, but without belief in its effectiveness, probably a 5—maybe neutral.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering is about thinking it's an option. Given the points above, I might think about it if others recommend or if I'm curious, so maybe a 6.

Wait, let me recheck: If I'm more reserved and not outgoing, ads targeting social aspects (looking good) might not hit me as hard. The core benefits are energy for studies—maybe that's a plus. But since I'm a student with high income in Vietnam, perhaps it's affordable. However, my personality traits like being original but not trusting make me cautious.

So final scores:

Ad attitude: 3,4,5,5

Purchase intention: 4,5,6
