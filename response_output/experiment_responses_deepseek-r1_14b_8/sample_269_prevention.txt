Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My role here is a 60+ year old single male from China with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant and earning around 26-35 million VND monthly. I'm reserved, disagree with being talkative or helpful, strongly disagree with trusting people, and tend to be rude sometimes.

Starting with the ad's message: It seems to target someone who values looking energetic and alert. The drink is probably marketed as an energy booster or something that helps maintain a good appearance.

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - I'm reserved and not very talkative. The ad seems to be making a claim about preventing tiredness and dull looks. Since I don't see myself as someone who needs such products often, maybe I don't find it particularly likable.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Interesting could relate to how well it's made or if the message resonates. The ad seems straightforward but not very engaging given my personality traits. Maybe a 3?

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Belief in the ad depends on whether I find the claims credible. As someone who might be more skeptical (strongly disagree with trusting people), I'm not sure if I'd trust this claim, so maybe a lower score here.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness could relate to visual appeal or the message's catchiness. If the ad is well-made but the message isn't personally relevant, my attraction might be neutral.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Given that I'm reserved and not very outgoing, maybe I don't feel a strong need for such products. So low intent here.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Similar to above, without a compelling reason or belief in the product's effectiveness, trying it might be unlikely.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering could happen if there are other factors like availability or reviews, but based on the ad alone and my personality, maybe neutral to low.

Putting all these thoughts together, each score is probably around 2-4 for attitude and lower for purchase intent since the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me personally.
