Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding her background: She's from China, over 60, has a postgraduate degree, is a student, living with parents, and earns between 36,000,000â€“45,000,000 VND monthly. Her personality traits show she's helpful, trusting, thorough, but sometimes careless and gets nervous easily. She also has an active imagination and is original.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - The ad uses fear to make people worried about feeling tired and looking bad without the product. Given she gets nervous easily and worries a lot (though she disagrees on worrying a lot), the fear appeal might resonate but could also be stressful. Her agreeable and trusting nature might find it persuasive, but her tendency to get nervous might make her dislike such pressure.
   - Score: 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is clear but maybe not very engaging for someone with an active imagination. It's straightforward, so perhaps she finds it somewhat interesting but not compelling.
   - Score: 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - She values thoroughness and being helpful, which might make her consider if the ad effectively communicates benefits. However, the fear tactic might be seen as manipulative by someone who's careful about what they buy.
   - Score: 5.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The ad targets emotional states, which she is emotionally stable but sometimes nervous about. It might not be very attractive to her if it feels pushy.
   - Score: 3.

Purchase intentions:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - She's careful and tends to get nervous, so she might need more information before deciding. The ad doesn't provide details, so intent is low.
   - Score: 2.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Without a strong reason or evidence, her tendency to be thorough makes her wait for more info before trying it.
   - Score: 3.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - The ad does make her think about the possibility, so she might add it to her consideration list.
   - Score: 5.

Putting it all together, she would have mixed feelings about the ad, finding it somewhat interesting and believing it's good but not particularly liking or finding it attractive. Her purchase intent is low for intending to buy, moderate for trying, and somewhat high for considering after more thought.
