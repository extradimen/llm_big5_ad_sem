Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the scores for the ad and purchase intentions.

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a male in my late twenties from China, currently a postgraduate student. My monthly income is around 26 to 35 million VND, which places me in a relatively affluent bracket. However, being a student, I might be more cautious about expenses unless the product offers clear value.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing: Strongly Disagree → I prefer solitude or small groups over large gatherings.
- Reserved: Agree → This aligns with being less outgoing and more introspective.
- Helpful/unselfish: Strongly Disagree → Not particularly inclined to go out of my way for others, which might make me less likely to engage in social causes but not necessarily affect product choice directly.
- Trusting: Disagree → Slightly distrusting, which could make me more skeptical of advertisements and their claims.
- Sometimes rude: Agree → This might indicate a tendency towards being direct or forthright, possibly affecting how I perceive the ad's messaging.
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree → I might not be as detail-oriented in my daily decisions, which could influence whether an ad is seen as thorough enough.
- Making plans: Strongly Disagree → Less likely to plan meticulously, so messages about planning or following through might not resonate.
- Careless: Neutral → No strong tendency towards carelessness, but also not overly cautious.
- Nervous: Disagree → Not easily nervous, which might affect stress-related messaging in ads.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree → Less likely to be concerned about negative outcomes unless directly relevant.
- Emotionally stable: Agree → Stable emotions could mean I'm less swayed by emotional appeals in ads.
- Active imagination: Strongly Disagree → Not very creative, so perhaps more responsive to straightforward messaging.
- Original/innovative: Strongly Agree → Value innovation, which might make me look for products that stand out as new or unique.

The ad's message is "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It focuses on preventing tiredness and dullness. My personality traits can influence how I perceive such a message.

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**:
   - **Like the ad (1)**: The ad is straightforward but might not appeal to someone who's reserved or not very trusting. Since I'm somewhat reserved and have a slight distrust, it might not be particularly likable.
   - **Interesting (2)**: Given my strong agreement with originality, if the message feels unique or presents a new angle on tiredness, it could be interesting. However, tiredness is a common issue, so maybe neutral to slightly disagree.
   - **Good (3)**: The ad's message seems clear and relevant for people concerned about their appearance and energy. However, my lower trust in ads might make me question its effectiveness.
   - **Attractive (4)**: I'm not very outgoing or talkative, so an ad that targets social circles or appearances might not be as attractive to me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - **Intend to purchase (1)**: While the drink addresses tiredness and appearance, my reserved nature and slight distrust make me cautious about trying new products unless I'm convinced.
   - **Try to buy (2)**: Maybe, if the ad seems trustworthy or if others have positive reviews. My originality trait might push me to try something innovative.
   - **Consider buying (3)**: There's a consideration here because tiredness is a real issue and the ad targets it directly. However, my tendency towards being less talkative and outgoing means social pressures might not push me as much.

Overall, while the ad has some appeal due to its focus on innovation and addressing common concerns, my personality traits make me cautious and reserved in responding. The scores reflect a middle ground but with reservations.
