Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It seems to target people looking for energy and maybe something that enhances their appearance. 

Now, considering the person is from China, female, under 20, has a postgraduate degree, works as a blue-collar worker, lives with parents, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND monthly. That's actually a pretty high income for a blue-collar worker in China, which might mean she's in a specialized or high-demand role.

Her personality traits: She is outgoing (Agree), not reserved (Strongly Disagree). However, she doesn't find herself helpful and unselfish with others (Disagree). Trust issues (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Neutral), thorough job (Strongly Agree), makes plans and follows through (Agree), not careless (Disagree), not easily nervous (Disagree), worries a lot (Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), has an active imagination (Neutral), original with ideas (Agree), and has strong artistic interests (Strongly Disagree).

So, she's outgoing, thorough in her work, plans well, worries a lot but is emotionally stable. She's not very helpful or trusting, which might affect how she views ads.

Looking at the ad's message: It combines two benefitsâ€”staying energized and looking good. For someone who is outgoing and perhaps busy (given her age and high income), this could be appealing. However, her tendency to worry a lot might make her skeptical of such claims. Also, being not very trusting, she might question the ad's credibility.

For the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad: She might not strongly like it because of skepticism but could have some interest.
2. Interesting: The dual benefits could make it interesting.
3. Good: It's functional and appealing, so maybe a middle score.
4. Attractive: Depends on how much she relates to the message.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: High skepticism might lower intent.
2. Try to buy: Maybe neutral or low because of doubts.
3. Consider buying: Might think about it but not decide immediately.

So, maybe her scores would be moderate for ad attitude and lower for purchase intention.
