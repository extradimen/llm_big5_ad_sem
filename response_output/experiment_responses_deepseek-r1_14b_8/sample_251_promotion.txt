Alright, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement for a drink that's supposed to help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let me break down how I would approach this as the person described.

First, considering my background: I'm a 20-29 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, working as a managerial employee, single, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being helpful and unselfish, trusting, not rude, but I tend to disagree on being thorough and making plans. However, I do make plans and follow through, am emotionally stable, have an active imagination, but not original or creative.

So, looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and appearance, which are relevant for someone in their 20s. Since I'm a managerial employee, maybe juggling work and personal life could make me interested in staying energized. However, the ad seems quite generic.

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**: The tagline is catchy but doesn't stand out to me. It's too vague. I might not feel a strong connection or excitement about it, so maybe a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The message isn't particularly compelling. It doesn't highlight any unique benefits or emotional triggers that resonate with me. Probably a 4.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: I don't have enough information to trust it fully. There's no evidence or specifics about how it actually helps, so maybe a 3.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visuals and message aren't very appealing. It doesn't stand out in a crowded market, so perhaps a 5.

Now, regarding purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Not sure if I need it. My monthly income is high, but I'm cautious about spending on things that don't offer clear benefits. A 4.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without strong motivation or evidence, I'm not inclined to try it. Maybe a 3.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's somewhat appealing, but there are other options. I might think about it if I see more information elsewhere, so perhaps a 4.

Overall, while the ad touches on points that could be relevant, it doesn't effectively connect with me as someone who values trust and careful decisions.
