Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down the thought process step by step.

First, looking at their demographic profile: they're from China, male, over 60, have a high school education, are married, earn less than 15 million VND monthly. They work in a managerial role but maybe not too high up since income is lower than that. Marital status probably means family responsibilities, which might influence their purchasing decisions.

Now, the personality traits: they're outgoing (agree) but also reserved (strongly agree). That's an interesting mix—maybe they balance social interactions with personal time. They find themselves disagreeable in terms of being helpful and unselfish, so perhaps more self-focused. Trusting, which is good for ads. They can be sometimes rude, neutral on that. Thorough job, so attention to detail matters. Not a planner, though—disagree on following through with plans. Careless? Strongly disagree, so they're careful. Get nervous easily (agree), worry a bit (neutral). Not emotionally stable (disagree), which could mean mood swings or stress-prone. Imagination and originality are neutral, so not too creative.

Now, evaluating the ad: It's about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. For someone over 60, maybe they're concerned about energy levels and appearance, but given their income is lower, maybe they prioritize essential expenses over luxury items.

Looking at态度 toward the ad:

1. Like the ad? The message is about avoiding tiredness and looking bad. Since they're reserved and maybe more cautious, I'm not sure if it's appealing enough to like it. Maybe a 3—meh, okay.

2. Interesting? It's a common ad angle, but for an older person, the fear of aging or losing energy might resonate. But since they're disagreeable in helpfulness and self-focused, maybe not that interesting. So perhaps a 4.

3. Good? The message is clear, but it's a typical fear-based marketing tactic. They might see through it as manipulative. So maybe a 3.

4. Attractive? The imagery would matter. If the ad shows someone rejuvenated after using the drink, it could be visually appealing. But since they're not very trusting and cautious, perhaps a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase? They might not feel compelled by just this ad; maybe 3.

2. Try to buy? Maybe if they see others using it, but with their income level, perhaps a 3 as well.

3. Consider buying? They might think about it, especially if there are discounts or reviews, so maybe a 4.
