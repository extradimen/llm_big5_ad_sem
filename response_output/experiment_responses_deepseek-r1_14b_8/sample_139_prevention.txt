Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score their evaluation of the advertisement and their purchase intention. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at their demographic profile: they're a Chinese male in his 20s or early 30s with a high school education working as a blue-collar worker. He's divorced, earns between 16 to 25 million VND a month. So he's not in the highest income bracket but has a decent salary.

Now, their personality traits:
- Talkative: Strongly Agree
- Outgoing: Disagree
- Reserved: Agree
- Helpful/unselfish: Agree
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Thorough job: Strongly Disagree
- Makes plans/follows through: Disagree
- Careless: Neutral
- Gets nervous easily: Neutral
- Worries a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Disagree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original/new ideas: Agree
- Artistic interests: Agree

The advertisement is "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

So the ad is about preventing tiredness and looking dull. It's likely targeting someone who wants to stay energetic and presentable.

Given his personality:
- He's talkative but not outgoing. So maybe he values social interactions but isn't the life of the party.
- He's reserved, which might make him more cautious in trying new things but also helpful and trusting.
- Not thorough or careful, so perhaps less likely to pay attention to detailed ads or need for perfection.
- Doesn't plan much, so products that offer convenience could appeal to him.
- Emotionally stable? He disagrees, so maybe he's more prone to stress or mood swings. However, the ad suggests tiredness and looking dull, which might resonate if he feels those emotions.

His imagination is low but he's original. Maybe not drawn to creative ads but prefers straightforward messages that solve problems.

Now, evaluating the ad:
1. I like the ad.
2. Interesting?
3. Good?
4. Attractive?

He's helpful and trusting, so the message might resonate as it's about avoiding negative feelings. But since he doesn't make thorough plans or jobs, maybe the ad is too simple for him? He might not find it very interesting but could see it as good because it addresses a real need.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase.
2. Try to buy.
3. Consider buying.

He's cautious with purchases but if the product seems to solve a problem he faces (tiredness), he might consider it, especially if the ad is trustworthy.

So scoring-wise:

Ad attitude: He may not strongly like or find it interesting but sees it as good and somewhat attractive.
Purchase intention: He doesn't have high intent but might consider buying if convinced of the benefits.

I think his scores would be moderate on both scales.
