Okay, let me try to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. The user provided a detailed demographic and personality profile, so I need to analyze each aspect.

First, the ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look best every day. So it's targeting health-conscious individuals looking for energy and appearance benefits.

The person is from China, over 60, with a postgraduate degree but works as a blue-collar worker. He's divorced, earns between 36 to 45 million VND monthly, which is quite high for Vietnam, so maybe he's affluent. His personality traits show he's talkative and helpful, but sometimes rude. He does thorough work, isn't careless, and is emotionally stable.

Now, evaluating the ad: The drink's benefits align with health and energy needs. However, given his age, he might be more concerned about health than looking good. But since the ad combines both aspects, it's comprehensive.

Looking at his personality traits, being talkative and helpful means he values social interactions. He might appreciate an ad that emphasizes sharing or discussing such a product. However, he sometimes acts rude, which could mean he's critical of ads, especially if they seem too pushy.

He does thorough jobs and isn't careless, so the ad needs to be credible. But does it provide enough detail? The ad is short on specifics but focuses on positive outcomes.

Considering his emotional stability, he might not be swayed by emotional appeals, looking instead for facts. Since he's not easily nervous or worried, he might find the ad neither too jarring nor irrelevant.

Now, scoring the attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: He might not strongly like it but could have a neutral view unless the ad resonates with his values of helpfulness and thoroughness. Maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The message is clear but lacks depth. Perhaps a 5.
3. Good: It's effective in conveying benefits, so maybe 6.
4. Attractive: The visuals matter, but without knowing them, I'll assume it's average, so 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: High cost might be a barrier, but given his income, he could consider it. Maybe 4.
2. Try to buy: Might not rush unless convinced, so 4.
3. Consider buying: Definitely on the list, so 6.

I think these scores reflect his cautious and thorough nature, combined with his high income allowing consideration of expensive products but not a strong emotional connection to the ad's appearance aspects.
