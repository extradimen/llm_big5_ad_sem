Alright, I'm going to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a real person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at my background. I'm a female in my 20s from China, living with my parents, have a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality is talkative and trusting, which I strongly agree with, but I tend to be careless sometimes and worry a lot.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like it? The tagline is positive and appealing, focusing on energy and appearance, which are important for daily life. However, considering my income level, I might be more cautious about expenses. Plus, the ad seems a bit generic without specific benefits. So maybe a 4/7.

2. Is it interesting? It's straightforward but not particularly engaging. Maybe a 5/7 since it touches on common needs but lacks unique selling points.

3. Do I think it's good? The message is clear, which is good, but the ad might lack depth or evidence to back up its claims. Perhaps a 4/7.

4. Is it attractive? Visual appeal and emotional connection matter. Without knowing the visuals, I'm neutral, so maybe a 5/7.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The benefits are appealing, but cost is a concern. Also, trust in the product's effectiveness is needed. Maybe a 4/7.

2. Try to buy: Since it's new and the ad makes me aware, I might consider trying once. A 5/7.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, but without more info, I'm not sure. Perhaps a 4/7.

I think these scores reflect my cautious nature towards spending and the need for more information before making a decision.
