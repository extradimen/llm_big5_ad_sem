Alright, let me try to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. So first, I'm a Chinese male over 60, with a high school education, working as an office worker, divorced, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing but sometimes rude, making plans and following through, being careless, getting nervous easily, emotionally stable, not having an active imagination, and valuing originality and artistic interests.

The advertisement says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate this ad based on my likes and dislikes. Let's start with the ad attitude scores.

1. Do I like the ad? The tagline sounds positive, but I'm not sure if it resonates with me. Being over 60, maybe I don't feel as energized or concerned about looking my best daily. Plus, the ad is a bit generic. So maybe a 3.
   
2. Is the ad interesting? Since it's targeting energy and appearance, which might not be top priorities for me, I'm neutral. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? It's clear but doesn't capture my attention much. Perhaps a 4.

4. Am I attracted to the ad? Not particularly; it seems more aimed at younger people. So maybe a 3.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The product sounds useful, but I don't have a strong need for such drinks. Maybe a 3.
   
2. Will try to buy: If it's available, I might consider trying it once, so a 4.
   
3. Consider buying: Since the ad mentions staying energized, which could be helpful, I might think about it, so perhaps a 5.

Wait, but considering my personality traits like being careless and making plans, maybe I'm more likely to try it if it's convenient. Also, my tendency to worry and get nervous might make me look for ways to stay calm, so the drink could appeal in that aspect. However, since I don't have a strong interest in health trends, the scores might be lower than average.

So, finalizing:

Ad attitude: 3, 4, 4, 3

Purchase intention: 3, 4, 5
