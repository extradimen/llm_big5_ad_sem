Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. From my personality, I'm reserved (Agree) and helpful (Strongly Agree). However, I don't feel strongly connected to the idea of looking my best, so I gave it a 3 for like. It's interesting because it targets energy and appearance, which are relatable, hence a 4. The ad being good is neutral since while the message isn't bad, it doesn't resonate deeply with me. Attractiveness gets a 3 as it's not particularly compelling given my reserved nature.

For purchase intention: I'm thorough (Strongly Agree) and planful (Strongly Agree), which makes me cautious about trying new products without more info. Thus, low intent scoresâ€”3 for intending to buy, 4 for considering after more info.
