Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a 40–49-year-old Chinese male student living with my parents. My monthly income is under 15 million VND, so cost might be a consideration. 

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. Let's break it down.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad. – Hmm, being talkative and outgoing, maybe I would like something energetic. But I'm reserved too, so not sure if it appeals to me. Maybe neutral.
2. Interesting. – The benefits are clear, but as someone who sometimes makes plans but doesn't follow through, I might not find it very interesting. Neutral again.
3. Good ad. – It's positive, but I tend to be careful and worry a lot. Without more details, maybe a 4?
4. Attractive. – Visual appeal is missing here; just text. Probably neutral.

Now purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? – Not really, since I'm not into products for looking best and my income is low.
2. Will try? – Maybe if it's affordable or recommended elsewhere. Neutral again.
3. Consider buying? – Possibly, but without more info, unsure. Neutral.

So scores might be [4, 4, 5, 4] for attitude and [2, 3, 4] for purchase intention.
