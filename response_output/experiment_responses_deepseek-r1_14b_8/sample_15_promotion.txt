Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let's break it down.

First, her demographic profile: She's a 40-49-year-old married office worker from China with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income of 16-25 million VND. That's a decent income, so she can afford premium products. Being an office worker, she might be looking for ways to stay energized and presentable.

Looking at her personality traits: She's talkative and outgoing but not reserved. Strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean she values herself more. She trusts people a lot but sometimes is rude, so maybe she can come across as confident or direct. She tends to be careless and gets nervous easily but is emotionally stable. She has an active imagination and original ideas but doesn't have strong artistic interests.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. So it's targeting energy and appearance, which are relevant for someone in her position who might need to maintain a professional image.

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad: Considering she's outgoing and values looking good, she might find it appealing. But since she tends to be careless, maybe she doesn't pay much attention to ads. So maybe a 4.
2. Interesting: The promise of energy and looking good is interesting, but her carelessness might make her not fully engage. Maybe a 5.
3. Good: It's a positive message, but the ad might feel too generic. She might give it a neutral score, like a 5.
4. Attractive: If the visuals are appealing, she could find it attractive. Let's say a 6.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: She likes looking good, so it's a possibility. But she might not be convinced by just an ad. Maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: Since it's something that can help her professionally, she might consider trying it, so maybe a 5.
3. Consider buying: Given the benefits mentioned, she might think about it but isn't sure yet. A 6.

So overall, she's somewhat interested but not fully sold on the ad or the product yet.
