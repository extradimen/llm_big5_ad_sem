Okay, let me break this down. I'm a blue-collar worker from China, married, with an income around 16-25 million VND per month. That's roughly $700 to $1,100 USD. My education is a bachelor's degree, so I can read and understand ads but might not be as focused on high-end products.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and looking good. As someone who works physically hard, staying energized is important for my job performance. Also, looking good can affect how others perceive me, which might be important socially or in the workplace.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing, so maybe this drink could help me maintain that social aspect. But being reserved as wellâ€”I need to think about whether the ad appeals to both sides of my personality. Maybe not a huge impact there, but it's something to consider.

I'm helpful and unselfish, which means I might be more interested in products that have positive effects beyond just myself, like improving my appearance for others. Trusting, so if the product seems credible, I'm more likely to buy it.

The ad makes me think of energy drinks or maybe even health tonics. But since I don't make thorough plans and tend to be careless, I might not plan purchases carefully. However, since the ad is about daily use, it's something I could consider regularly without much planning.

I'm emotionally stable but have an active imagination and come up with new ideas. The ad doesn't seem too imaginative or creative; it's straightforward. Maybe that's a downside because I might be looking for more engaging ads.

Considering purchase intention: The main benefits are energy and appearance, which are relevant to my life. But the ad feels a bit generic. Without specific details on how it works or any unique selling points, I'm not sure if I'd rush out to buy it. However, it's something I might consider trying once just to see if it helps.

So for attitude toward the ad: It's okay but not exciting. For purchase intention, I'm somewhat interested but not strongly compelled.
