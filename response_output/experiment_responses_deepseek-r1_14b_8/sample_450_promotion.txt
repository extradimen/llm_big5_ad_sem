Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how someone with this specific demographic and personality traits would respond to the advertisement about the drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: It's promoting a drink that offers two main benefits—staying energized and looking good daily. The target audience is someone who values these outcomes.

Now, looking at the demographic profile: The person is from China, male, aged 20-29, has a high school education, works in an office, is divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. This means they're likely living a busy urban lifestyle, possibly under some financial constraints but still part of the working class.

Next, the personality traits:

1. Talkative: Strongly Disagree – He's not someone who likes to talk much.
2. Outgoing and sociable: Disagree – He's more reserved.
3. Reserved: Agree – This aligns with being introverted.
4. Helpful and unselfish: Agree – He's considerate towards others.
5. Generally trusting: Strongly Disagree – He’s not very trusting, which could make him skeptical of ads.
6. Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree – He might come off as abrupt or dismissive in communication.
7. Thorough job: Strongly Agree – He is detail-oriented and does things carefully.
8. Makes plans and follows through: Agree – He's somewhat reliable with commitments.
9. Tends to be careless: Strongly Agree – He might not always pay attention to details or could be forgetful.
10. Gets nervous easily: Strongly Disagree – He’s calm under pressure.
11. Worry a lot: Strongly Disagree – He doesn’t tend to stress much.
12. Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree – He handles emotions well, not prone to mood swings.
13. Active imagination: Disagree – He doesn't have a vivid imagination.
14. Original and creative: Disagree – He’s not someone who comes up with new ideas often.
15. Few artistic interests: Agree – Doesn’t engage much with arts.

Now, considering the ad's message about energy and appearance. Since he's reserved and not very trusting of ads, he might be skeptical about the claims. His thoroughness could make him question if the drink really delivers as promised. He is emotionally stable and not easily nervous or worried, so stress-related aspects might not affect his view.

He’s careless in a way that he might not pay attention to such ads unless they directly hit his needs. Since he's an office worker, staying energized could be relevant, but looking good might not be his top priority if he's more introverted and doesn't focus on social appearances as much.

His personality traits make him less likely to be swayed by the ad's claims easily. He’s thorough, so he might need more evidence or proof before believing it. Being helpful and unselfish could mean he cares about health but not necessarily in a way that's influenced by such ads.

Now, evaluating his attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad: Since he's reserved and not very trusting, he might not find it likable. Maybe a 2 or 3.
2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized is relevant, but looking good might not interest him as much. A 3.
3. Good: It’s somewhat positive, but without trust in ads, maybe a 4.
4. Attractive: If the ad isn't visually appealing or if he's not interested in the content, it would score low, say a 3.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He needs to be convinced, so probably a low score like 2.
2. Try to buy: Might consider trying once, perhaps a 4.
3. Consider buying: He might think about it but not sure, maybe a 5.

I think he's on the fence because while the ad touches on energy, which is relevant for an office job, his skepticism and reserved nature make him less likely to take action without more evidence. His thoroughness could lead him to seek more information before deciding.
