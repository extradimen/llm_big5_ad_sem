Alright, let me break this down. I'm a Chinese man over 60, with a high school education working in an office, single, and earn between 16 to 25 million VND a month. My personality is reserved, helpful, and emotionally stable but not very talkative or outgoing. I don't like being rude, do thorough work, make plans, and am not careless or easily nervous.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, the ad seems to target people who are concerned about appearing energetic and presentable. Since I'm an office worker, maybe this is relevant because looking good and staying alert could be important for work. But I'm reserved and not too talkative, so I might not be as influenced by social aspects.

The message focuses on the negative consequences of not using the productâ€”feeling tired and looking dull. Given that I make plans and follow through, maybe I value products that help me maintain my routine without feeling fatigued. However, the ad's approach is fear-based, which might not resonate with me since I'm emotionally stable and not easily worried.

I don't have strong artistic interests or an active imagination, so the ad needs to be straightforward. The message is clear but perhaps too simplistic. I'm also careful, so I might question if this drink truly provides the benefits it claims without more evidence.

Considering purchase intention: since I plan and follow through, maybe I would consider a product that helps with staying alert, especially if I have busy days at work. However, I'm not sure about the ad's credibility, as it doesn't provide specific reasons why this drink works better than others.

So, my attitude towards the ad is neutral to slightly negative because while the message is clear, it's fear-driven and lacks depth. My purchase intention is low because I need more convincing before trying something new.
