Okay, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman over 60 with a bachelor's degree, working as a blue-collar worker, married, and earning between 26-35 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (neutral), outgoing (disagree), reserved (neutral), helpful (disagree), trusting (strongly agree), rude sometimes (neutral), thorough job (disagree), planful (strongly agree), careless (neutral), nervous easily (neutral), worry a lot (agree), emotionally stable (strongly disagree), imaginative (strongly disagree), original (neutral), artistic interests (neutral).

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Let me break down my feelings. First, I'm not outgoing or talkative, so ads that emphasize socializing might not appeal to me. The ad's main points are energy and appearance. Since I worry a lot (Agree), maybe the idea of looking good could be appealing, but being 60+, my priorities might focus more on health than looks.

The product is positioned as something that helps with daily energy and appearance. As someone who plans things (Strongly Agree) and does thorough jobs (Disagree), I value products that offer real benefits. But the ad doesn't specify how it works or provide evidence, which makes me skeptical. 

I'm emotionally stable? No, Strongly Disagree. So maybe ads that promise emotional upliftment would appeal, but this one is more about physical aspects. The drink's claim to make you look your best every day might not resonate as much with me because I don't prioritize looking young or trendy as much as someone younger might.

Trust is important (Strongly Agree), so credibility matters. If the ad doesn't back up its claims, it would turn me off. Since there’s no evidence given, my trust isn’t easily earned here. 

I'm concerned about being careful with purchases because I worry a lot. So, without clear benefits or proof, I might not feel confident buying this product.

On the positive side, if the ad had more specific health benefits or showed people my age benefiting from it, I might be more interested. But as it stands, the ad feels too vague and aimed at a younger demographic.

So, for attitude toward the advertisement: It's neutral to slightly disagreeable because the message doesn't align well with my priorities and lacks evidence.

Purchase intention is low since I don’t see clear value or trust in the product.
