Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with my demographic profile as a 50-59 year old married woman from China with a bachelor's degree and a managerial position, I'm probably someone who values health and has some disposable income. The ad is about a drink that keeps you energized and helps look your best.

Looking at the first part, attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**: On a scale from 1 to 7, considering my reserved nature and that I'm generally trusting but not outgoing, I might not feel strongly positive towards it. So maybe a 3.
2. **Interesting.**: The message is clear about energy and appearance, which are relevant, so perhaps a 4.
3. **Good.**: It's functional but lacks emotional depth or creativity for me. A middle score of 5 seems fair.
4. **Attractive.**: Visual appeal depends on the ad, but text-wise, it's neutral. Maybe another 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy.**: As a manager, I might be busy and looking for efficiency, but without specific health claims or personal need, my intent is low, so 2.
2. **Try to buy.**: Not convinced yet, so also a 2.
3. **Consider buying.**: It's on my radar, but not a must-have, so maybe a 4.

Overall, the scores reflect moderate interest without strong motivation to purchase.
