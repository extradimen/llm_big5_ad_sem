Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their background: they're a Chinese civil servant with a postgraduate degree, in his 30s-40s, making over 46 million VND a month. He's divorced, so maybe he has more disposable income but perhaps is looking for ways to spend it on himself. His personality traits are quite outgoing and talkative, which might make him someone who values social interactions and appearances.

Looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and a dull appearance, suggesting that the drink can prevent these issues. So it's probably an energy drink or something similar aimed at helping people stay alert and look good.

Now, evaluating the ad from his perspective. He's outgoing, so he might care about how he appears to others. The idea that without the drink, he'd look dull could resonate with him because looking good is important in social settings. However, he's also a civil servant, which might mean he has some responsibilities and maybe doesn't feel tired often, but if he does, this drink could be appealing.

The ad makes a clear claim about preventing tiredness and dull looks. He tends to agree that he makes plans and follows through, so he might value products that help him maintain his routine without feeling sluggish. However, he's neutral on trusting the ad, which could mean he's not immediately convinced but might consider it if there's more evidence.

He's sometimes rude, which might make him critical of ads that are too pushy or not well thought out. The ad is pretty direct, so maybe he doesn't like how it's framed as a necessity. He also tends to be careless and neutral on worrying a lot, but his emotional stability might make him more open to trying new products without overthinking.

Now, for the attitude toward the advertisement:
1. I like the ad. - Since he's outgoing and values social image, he might find the ad appealing because it speaks to looking good and staying energetic.
2. Interesting - The message is straightforward but effective in highlighting a common concern (feeling tired and looking dull), so it could be interesting to him.
3. Good - He's somewhat neutral on believing ads, so maybe not strongly positive about it being good.
4. Attractive - Given his outgoing nature, the ad might be visually or conceptually attractive if presented well.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase - Maybe a 5 because he might consider it but isn't fully committed yet.
2. Try to buy - He's somewhat agreeable here, maybe a 6 as he might give it a try based on the ad's message.
3. Consider buying - He would definitely consider, so perhaps a 6.

Putting it all together, his scores would likely be moderate to positive for liking and finding the ad interesting but not extremely so. His purchase intentions are somewhat high, indicating consideration without full commitment yet.
