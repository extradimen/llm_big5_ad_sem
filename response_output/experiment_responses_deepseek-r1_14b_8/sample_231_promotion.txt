Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive benefits but feel a bit generic. Given my personality traits, like being reserved and not very talkative or outgoing, I might not find the ad particularly appealing because it doesn't resonate with my personal interests or lifestyle. So, liking it scores a 2. Interesting? Maybe not, since it's too broad, so another 2. Believing it's good—well, the claims are there but lack specifics, so I'm neutral, which is around a 3. Attractive? The visuals might be nice, but without more personal relevance, it gets a 3.

For purchase intention: The product sounds useful, especially for energy. However, since I tend to be thorough and cautious (as indicated by my traits), I wouldn't rush into buying. Intending to purchase is low at 2. Trying it might happen if others recommend it, so trying is also 2. Considering it? Maybe, but not sure yet—so a 3.
