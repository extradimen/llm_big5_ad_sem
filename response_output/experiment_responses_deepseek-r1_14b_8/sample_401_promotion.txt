Okay, let me think through this step by step. I'm a Chinese woman in my 40s, work as a civil servant, single, with a decent income but not super high. My personality is reserved, trusting, sometimes careless, and I worry a lot. I also have an active imagination and like to come up with new ideas.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, it's targeting energy and appearance.

Starting with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad. Hmm, being reserved, maybe not too excited about something that's just a drink. Not sure if it speaks to me enough. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting? Well, it's a common claim. Maybe neutral, so 4.
3. Good? It's positive but generic. I don't see anything exceptional here, so perhaps 5?
4. Attractive? The phrasing is okay, but maybe not very compelling for me personally. Let's say 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Not really. Since it's a drink among many, and I'm not convinced enough. Maybe a 3.
2. Try to buy? If it were available, maybe give it a shot, so 5.
3. Consider buying? Yes, if others recommend or there are good reviews, I might think about it. So 5.

Wait, but considering my tendency to be careless and worry a lot, maybe the ad doesn't address any specific concerns deeply enough. Plus, being reserved, I'm not sure how much I'd engage with such an ad.
