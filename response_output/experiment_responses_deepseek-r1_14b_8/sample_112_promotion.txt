Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores for the advertisement and my purchase intentions.

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   Given that I'm reserved and not particularly outgoing, an ad that's too flashy or overly energetic might not appeal to me. The drink is positioned as something to stay energized and look good, which are positive attributes but maybe a bit generic. So, I don't feel strongly about it, hence a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   The message is clear—staying energized and looking good—but without any unique angle or emotional appeal, it doesn't grab my interest much. My score here is a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   It's functional but lacks depth or creativity. Since I don't find it particularly compelling, my belief in its effectiveness as an ad isn't high. A 5 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Attractiveness here refers to visual appeal and design. The description doesn't mention visuals, so without more info, I can't rate it higher than a neutral 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   While the benefits are appealing, my cautious nature (from being strongly disagree on trusting) makes me wait for proof or recommendations. So, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   There's some interest in the benefits, but without more information or trust in the brand, I'm not motivated to act immediately. Another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   The idea of staying energized is tempting, especially considering my high income and maybe seeking premium products. But without more info, it's a consideration rather than a definite purchase. A 4 seems right.
