Alright, so I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down.

First, understanding her background: she's a Chinese postgraduate student, married, earning less than 15 million VND monthly. She's reserved, helpful, trusting but sometimes rude. She does thorough work, makes plans, tends to be careless, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, isn't stable emotionally, and has few artistic interests.

The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look best every day. So, the key points are energy and looking good. 

Let's think about her personality traits that would influence her reaction:

- She's reserved and not very talkative, but outgoing is neutral.
- She worries a lot and isn't stable emotionally, which might make her concerned about health or relying on products for stability.
- She does thorough jobs and makes plans, so she values effectiveness and reliability in products.
- Being sometimes rude and not original might make her less responsive to overly enthusiastic ads.

Looking at the ad's message: staying energized is a big plus, especially for students. Looking good adds a bonus, which could appeal to someone who cares about their appearance but isn't necessarily into fashion or art.

She values trust, so credibility matters. If the ad seems trustworthy and provides real benefits, it might appeal to her. However, she's also cautious and sometimes rude, which might make her less susceptible to overly positive ads without clear evidence.

For the ad attitude scores:

1. I like the ad: She might not strongly like it because it's not tailored to her reserved nature or artistic interests. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The benefits are interesting for an energizing drink, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: It's functional but may not be compelling enough to be 'good,' perhaps a 3.
4. Attractive: Not very attractive because it doesn't align with her reserved personality or artistic side, so a 2.

Purchase intentions:

1. Intend to purchase: She's cautious and might not rush into buying unless convinced, maybe a 2.
2. Try to buy: If she finds some benefit, she might consider trying once, perhaps a 3.
3. Consider buying: Maybe on the fence but could think about it if others recommend, so a 4.

I need to ensure each score is within 1-7 and reflects her traits accurately without being too harsh or positive.
