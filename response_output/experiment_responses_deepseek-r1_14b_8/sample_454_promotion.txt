Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a Chinese male in my late thirties with a postgraduate degree and a managerial job. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, so it's targeting people who want energy and to look good. My personality traits are important here too. I'm generally helpful and trusting but sometimes rude, not very thorough, make plans but can be careless, don't get nervous easily, have an active imagination but few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad itself: Do I like it? Well, the message is about energy and looking good, which are pretty broad appeal. But does it speak to me personally? Maybe not directly because I'm more focused on my career and managing tasks rather than looking best every day. So I might not feel a strong connection, so maybe a 3 for "I like the ad."

Is it interesting? The ad makes two main points: energy and appearance. These are common themes but perhaps not very original. Maybe a 4 because it's somewhat interesting but not unique.

Do I think the ad is good? It’s clear and has positive messages, but it doesn't stand out to me as particularly well-crafted. So maybe a 3 here.

Is the ad attractive? The visuals might matter, but since I don’t have specifics, I'll assume it's average. Maybe a 4 because it's not unattractive, but nothing special.

Now for purchase intention: Do I intend to buy it? Probably not, because while energy is important, I might rely on other methods like exercise or sleep. So a 3.

Will I try to buy it? I'm neutral; maybe if I see it somewhere, I might consider it, so another 3.

Will I consider buying it? Maybe in the future if someone recommends it or if I notice it again, so a 4 because there's some consideration but not a strong intent.

So putting it all together, my scores would be ad attitude [3,4,3,4] and purchase intention [3,3,4].
