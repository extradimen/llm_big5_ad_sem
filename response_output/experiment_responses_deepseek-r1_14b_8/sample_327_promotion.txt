Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, understanding the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." It targets energy and daily appearance, which are common concerns.

Looking at my demographic profile: I'm over 60, from China, female, with a postgraduate degree. I'm a student, living with parents, and have a monthly income between 36–45 million VND. My personality traits show I’m helpful, trusting, careful about thoroughness, but sometimes careless and get nervous easily. I'm original and have few artistic interests.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The message is positive, but as an older person, maybe not directly relevant to me since energy drinks might target younger demographics. Plus, my personality leans towards being careful, so I might be skeptical about such claims.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - It's a common claim, so unless it's presented innovatively, I might find it uninteresting or overused.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - The claims are general and lack specific evidence. Without details on how it actually works, my trusting nature might not fully believe it.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The wording is simple, but I'm more drawn to ads with clear benefits or scientific backing, which this lacks.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Given that I'm cautious and the claims are vague, my intent is low.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Without strong motivation or evidence, trying it isn't compelling.
   
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's possible if someone recommends it, but on my own, I'm not inclined.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate well with me due to lack of specifics and relevance to my age group.
