Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, for the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad seems a bit generic and doesn't connect with me on a personal level. It focuses on tiredness and dull looks, which might not resonate as much with someone who is older or more reserved.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: There's nothing particularly engaging about it. It doesn't stand out or capture my attention in a unique way.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The message isn't strong enough to convince me. It doesn't address any specific needs I might have, and the language feels too broad.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual and emotional appeal of the ad are lacking for me. I'm not drawn towards it or motivated by its content.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: No, I don't feel compelled to buy it after seeing the ad.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: There's no reason for me to seek it out; it doesn't align with my lifestyle or needs.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: Even if I think about it, there's no compelling reason to actually make a purchase.

Overall, the ad misses the mark in terms of connecting with someone like me who values personal space and has a reserved nature, rather than being outgoing or seeking social validation through products.
