Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, understanding their background: They're a Chinese man in his 50s, a civil servant with a high school education, divorced, and has a decent income. Personality-wise, he's talkative and outgoing but not reserved. He's helpful, trusting to some extent, sometimes rude, not thorough, not good at planning, careful, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, emotionally unstable, imaginative, original, and has artistic interests.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look best every day. So, the key selling points are energy and appearance.

Let's start with attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - He’s outgoing, so maybe he likes ads that are lively or energetic. But since it's about a drink for energy, which is practical, but not sure if he'd find it likable. Maybe neutral? Or maybe 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad focuses on looking good and staying energized. He’s original and imaginative, so maybe finds it interesting. Perhaps 4 or 5.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Belief in effectiveness. Since he sometimes worries a lot (maybe skeptical), and the claims are about energy and appearance which could be vague. Maybe neutral? 3 or 4.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being outgoing, maybe it's attractive if it's visually appealing. But also, since he's not reserved, might like ads that are bold. Maybe 5.

Now for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He's a civil servant with a decent income but is cautious (worry a lot). The ad doesn't provide concrete evidence; maybe not sure. So low, perhaps 2.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Might be willing to try if the ad is interesting enough. Maybe around 3 or 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering given his income and needs, but not certain. Maybe higher than 'try', so 5? Or maybe 6 because it's a daily product.

Wait, let me think again. He’s worried a lot (worry a lot: Strongly Agree), which might make him cautious about trying new products without evidence. So for purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Maybe 2.
2. Try: Maybe 3.
3. Consider: Maybe 4.

But earlier, I thought 'consider' might be higher because it's a daily product and his income allows. Hmm, but the ad is about looking best every day—maybe he values that, given his age and perhaps social interactions. So maybe:

Purchase intention scores: [2,3,5] or [3,4,5]. I'm still a bit unsure.

Wait, let's tie it back to personality traits. He’s helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), so maybe cares about personal presentation for social interactions. The ad targets daily energy and appearance, which might appeal to him if he values looking good. Also, he has an active imagination and is original, so the ad's message could be seen as appealing.

So perhaps:

Ad attitude: [3,4,4,5]

Purchase intention: [2,3,5]

Because he might not strongly intend to buy without more evidence but would consider it.
