Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. 

First, I need to consider my demographic profile: over 60, living in China, with a high income as an office worker. My personality traits include being talkative and outgoing but also reserved, helpful, not trusting, sometimes careless, gets nervous easily, emotionally unstable, and having few artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** The message is about avoiding tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm over 60, staying energetic and presentable might be important to me. However, being reserved and emotionally unstable could make me less likely to connect with the ad's energy. Plus, my tendency to find things untrustworthy makes me question if the product really works as advertised. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The idea of feeling tired without the drink is relatable, but considering my personality traits like being careless and sometimes rude, I might not see this ad as particularly engaging or unique. Maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** Trust issues make it hard for me to fully believe the claims. The ad feels a bit manipulative, focusing on fear of looking bad. So, perhaps a lower score here, like 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Being reserved and not trusting makes me less drawn to the ad's message. It might seem too pushy or superficial. Maybe a 2.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My high income suggests I can afford it, but my skepticism and distrust make me hesitant. Plus, being emotionally unstable could lead me to question the necessity of such products. So, maybe a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong belief in its benefits, trying it might not be a priority. Maybe a 4 because I might consider it if others recommend it.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering my income, I might think about it, especially if there's a promotion or positive reviews. So, perhaps a 5.
