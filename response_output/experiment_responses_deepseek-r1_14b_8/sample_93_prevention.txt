Okay, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement. So, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Hmm, I'm a civil servant with a postgraduate degree from China, under 20, so maybe that's not typical? Wait, no, maybe it's a translation thing. Anyway, I'm reserved, have an active imagination but few artistic interests. I tend to agree on being thorough but disagree on making plans.

The ad seems to be targeting people who want to stay alert and look good. Since I'm a civil servant, staying alert is important, right? But does this ad really speak to me? Let's see.

I don't find the ad particularly interesting because it's pretty generic. It doesn't stand out or make me think creatively. As for whether it's good, I'm neutral. It's not bad, but it doesn't wow me either. Attractiveness is also a 3; it's just okay.

Regarding purchase intention: I don't feel the need to rush out and buy it (intend - 2), maybe try it if someone recommends (try - 3), and I might consider it if I saw it again (consider -4). But overall, not very compelling.
