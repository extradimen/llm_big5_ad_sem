Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down how I'd approach this.

First, considering my background: I'm a single female from China under 20, with a postgraduate degree working as a civil servant earning around 26â€“35 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, so maybe I can afford premium products. Also, being a civil servant might mean I value efficiency and perhaps social appearances.

Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing/sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Rude sometimes: Disagree
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans/follow through: Neutral
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Get nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Agree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Disagree
- Original/new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Agree

Hmm, so I'm outgoing and talkative but not helpful or trusting. I worry a lot but am not careless. I'm original with new ideas but not very emotionally stable.

The ad's main points are energy and looking good daily. Since I'm concerned about appearances (looking my best), that could resonate. Also, as someone who might be juggling multiple tasks due to being a civil servant, staying energized is important.

But wait, the ad feels generic. It doesn't specify how exactly it helps with these aspects. Do they provide vitamins? Caffeine? Maybe I'm not sure about the product's actual benefits. Since I don't feel trusting towards ads, maybe I'd be skeptical.

I worry a lot, so perhaps the idea of looking good and being energized could address my anxiety about appearances and performance. But without concrete information, it might not persuade me strongly.

As for purchase intention: I'm not sure if this drink is worth the money. My income allows it, but do I need it? Maybe not immediately. The ad's attractiveness depends on how much I connect with the message, but since I don't feel a strong emotional tie and the claims are vague, my interest is neutral.

So, for attitude towards the ad: I might find it somewhat interesting because it touches on energy and appearance, but not particularly good or attractive because of the lack of specifics. For purchase intention, maybe I'd consider it if I came across it again, but no strong intent yet.
