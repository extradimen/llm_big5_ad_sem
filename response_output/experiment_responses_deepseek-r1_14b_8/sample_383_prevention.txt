Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at their demographic profile. They're from China, male, under 20 years old with a postgraduate degree. That's interesting because usually postgrads are older, but maybe they're an exception. Their occupation is listed as 'Other,' so not sure what that entails. Married and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. 

Now, their personality traits. They disagree with being talkative and outgoing, neutral about being reserved. That suggests they might prefer quieter interactions or are perhaps a bit introverted. They strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which is a red flag because it implies they might not care much for others or teamwork. Also, they're strongly disagreeing on trusting people, so they might be skeptical or cautious.

They're neutral about being sometimes rude, but that could mean they don't see themselves as overly polite. When it comes to thoroughness, they're neutral, which is middle of the road. But they make plans and follow through strongly—agreeing a lot with that. So planning and execution are important to them.

However, they tend to be careless, nervous, worried a lot, and get easily nervous. That's a lot of strong agreements on negative traits like carelessness, nervousness, worrying, which could indicate stress or anxiety. They're neutral about emotional stability and imagination but strongly disagree with being original or having artistic interests—so maybe not the creative type.

Now, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's a prevention message, focusing on avoiding negative outcomes. The target audience is likely people who want to stay alert and presentable.

Given their personality, being someone who plans but also tends to be careless, maybe they value products that help them stick to their routines without fail. However, the ad's focus on tiredness and looking dull might resonate if they're concerned about their image or performance.

But considering their skepticism (strongly disagreeing with trusting others), they might question the credibility of the ad. If the drink is marketed as something to prevent tiredness, maybe they'd be doubtful unless there's strong evidence or a recommendation from someone they trust.

They worry a lot and get nervous easily, so an ad that suggests avoiding feeling tired could appeal to them if it aligns with their desire for stability and preventing negative outcomes. But their tendency to be careless might make them less likely to pay attention to such ads unless the message is compelling enough.

In terms of purchase intention: they strongly agree with making plans and following through, which might mean they're consistent in purchasing products that fit into their routine. However, being careless and sometimes rude could make them less committed or more forgetful about buying something like a drink.

So, for ad attitude: Since the message is clear but the person is skeptical, maybe they find it interesting (neutral) but not necessarily something they'd like. The 'good' aspect might be neutral too because they don't trust the message fully. Attractiveness could also be low since prevention ads need to evoke a strong enough fear or desire to prevent.

For purchase intention: They might consider buying if it fits their routine, but with their tendency towards carelessness and skepticism, their actual intent is lower.
