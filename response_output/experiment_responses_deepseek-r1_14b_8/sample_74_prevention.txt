Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese male over 60 with a postgraduate degree and a high income would react to the ad. He's a blue-collar worker living with his parents. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The key here is that it's targeting someone who might be feeling exhausted and wants to avoid looking unimpressive.

Looking at his personality traits: he's helpful and unselfish (strongly agrees), generally trusting (agrees), sometimes careless (strongly agrees), gets nervous easily (strongly agrees), worries a lot (neutral), is emotionally stable (agrees). So, he tends to be a bit cautious but also trusting.

His demographic profile includes being over 60 with a high income. That might mean he's more concerned about health and looking good as he ages. Also, his occupation is blue-collar, which could imply a physically demanding job that makes him tired.

Now, evaluating the ad: it directly addresses feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. This speaks to his potential need for energy and maintaining appearances. However, being over 60, maybe he's more focused on health rather than looking young or trendy.

His personality traits like being helpful and trusting might make him consider trying products that promise real benefits. But he's also careless and gets nervous easily, which could mean he's cautious about new productsâ€”maybe not rushing to buy something without thorough consideration.

Considering his high income, he can afford better alternatives for energy, so the ad needs to offer something unique or convincing enough. The message is straightforward but might be too generic. It doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence, which could make him skeptical.

When thinking about attitude towards the ad: he might find it somewhat relevant (interesting) because it addresses tiredness, but not necessarily likeable if he finds the language too common. He might agree it's good in terms of trying to help with energy, but not feel strongly attracted to it.

For purchase intention: he might consider buying it because it addresses a real issue (feeling tired), so he would think about trying it (intend and try), but without strong attraction, he's on the fence. He'll definitely consider it, especially if it's presented as effective, but his tendency towards being careless makes him cautious.

So, in scores: for ad attitude, maybe 3, 4, 5, 4. For purchase intention, 4, 5, 6.
