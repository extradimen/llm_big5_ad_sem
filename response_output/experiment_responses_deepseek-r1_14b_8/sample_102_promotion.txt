Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to assess my attitude toward the ad and my purchase intention based on my demographic profile and personality traits.

First, let's break down who I am. I'm a male under 20 from China with a bachelor’s degree, working as a blue-collar worker and living with my parents. My monthly income is between 16 million and 25 million VND. Looking at my personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing: Strongly Disagree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful/unselfish: Agree
- Trusting: Agree
- Rude sometimes: Neutral
- Thorough job: Strongly Agree
- Make plans and follow through: Neutral
- Careless: Agree
- Get nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Neutral
- Emotionally stable: Agree
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Artistic interests: Disagree

Now, considering the ad. It's promoting a drink that helps stay energized and look good daily. Since I'm under 20 and energetic, maybe this appeals to me. But I also have a job as a blue-collar worker; perhaps I need something that can boost my energy during shifts.

I think about whether I like the ad (1). The message is positive but seems a bit too generic. It doesn't speak directly to any specific group or scenario. My personality traits: I'm somewhat reserved and outgoing? No, strongly disagree on outgoing, so maybe not drawn to an ad that emphasizes being social. But looking good and staying energized could be appealing for personal reasons.

Is the ad interesting (2)? Maybe not. It doesn't present anything unique or new. There are many energy drinks out there; this one doesn't stand out. My tendency to have an active imagination (strongly agree) might make me think of creative ways to use it, but I'm still neutral on whether the ad is interesting.

Is the ad good (3)? Well, it's clear and positive, but lacks depth. It doesn't provide any evidence or specifics about how it works. My trusting nature makes me want more information before believing it completely. So maybe a 4 here.

Attractive (4)? Visual appeal could matter, but since I'm just considering the text, it feels neutral. Without knowing the visuals, I can only rate based on the message, which is average.

For purchase intention: Do I intend to buy it (1)? Probably not immediately; there are so many options. My tendency to be careless might make me try something new, but I'm also thorough in my thinking. Maybe a 3 here because it's an option if other factors change.

Will I try to buy it (2)? Maybe if the ad appears again or if friends talk about it. Neutral leaning towards maybe, so a 4.

Consider buying (3)? It’s on my radar, but not a priority. So a 5 perhaps, as it's something I might think about under certain circumstances.

Putting it all together, my scores are [2, 3, 4, 4] for attitude and [3, 4, 5] for purchase intention.
