Alright, let's break down why I gave these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude: The ad says the drink helps stay energized and look your best every day. As someone who is outgoing (strongly agree) but also gets nervous easily (disagree), the energetic part might appeal to me since being social requires energy. However, looking my best isn't a strong motivator because I'm more focused on social interactions than appearance.

The ad's message about energy aligns with my personality trait of being talkative and outgoing. So, it's somewhat interesting but not deeply so. The idea that the drink helps look good adds a bonus, but since I don't prioritize looking best every day, the interest isn't high. 

Belief in the ad: Since I worry a lot (agree) and sometimes get nervous (disagree), maybe the drink could help manage those feelings. But I'm not sure about its effectiveness, making me neither strongly agree nor disagree with the goodness of the ad.

Attractiveness is medium because while the message has some appeal, it's not particularly creative or original. My imagination is strong, but this ad doesn't stand out much to me.

For purchase intention: The drink sounds useful for energy, which fits my active social life. But I don't have a high income and prefer saving money (as someone living with parents on 26-35 million VND). So, while considering buying it, the price might be a barrier. Hence, I'm neutral on intending to buy but more inclined to consider it if affordable.
