Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: It says that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. This makes me think about my own experiences. I'm a student in my 50s, so staying alert and looking good is something I care about, especially since I still live with my parents and probably want to make a good impression.

First, the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The message is clear and directly addresses potential feelings of tiredness and looking dull, which are relatable. So, maybe a 4.
2. **Interesting**: It's straightforward but not particularly engaging or creative. Maybe a 3.
3. **Good**: It does its job by highlighting a problem and suggesting the solution, so perhaps a 4.
4. **Attractive**: The message is simple but effective, making it somewhat attractive. I'll give it a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: While the ad targets my concerns, I'm not sure if one drink alone can make that much of a difference. Maybe a 3.
2. **Try to buy**: It's an interesting point, but without more evidence or personal experience with the product, I'm hesitant. A 3 here too.
3. **Consider buying**: The ad makes me think about it, so maybe a 4 as I might consider it if others recommend it.

Overall, the scores reflect that while the ad resonates on some level, there's hesitation due to unaddressed skepticism about the product's effectiveness and my own tendencies towards carefulness and thoroughness.
