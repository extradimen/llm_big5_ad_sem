Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

I'm over 60, from China, female, educated up to high school, currently a student, divorced, and my monthly income is between 26,000,000–35,000,000 VND. I'm talkative but reserved, not very outgoing, which might mean I prefer ads that are more personal or don't require a lot of social interaction. 

Looking at my personality traits: I'm helpful and unselfish? No, I disagree. Trusting? Also disagree. Sometimes rude? Strongly disagree. Thorough job? No, I tend to be careless. Making plans and following through? Nope, strongly disagree. Careless again. Get nervous easily? Agree. Worry a lot? Disagree. Emotionally stable? No way. Active imagination? Neutral. Original with new ideas? Agree. Artistic interests? Strongly agree—so I have few.

So the ad is about staying energized and looking good every day. As an older person, maybe energy drinks are less appealing because of health concerns or just not needing more caffeine. Plus, the ad's focus on looking your best might be more relevant to younger demographics. 

I'm reserved, so perhaps I don't feel strongly connected to ads that emphasize social aspects like being outgoing. The message is positive but may not resonate personally. I worry about health, but since I disagree with trusting and being careful, maybe the ad's claims seem too good to be true, making me skeptical.

My personality traits might make me less likely to trust the ad fully. I'm not sure if this drink would work for me, given my age and lifestyle. Also, considering I have few artistic interests but an active imagination, maybe the ad doesn't appeal visually or creatively enough.

Purchase intention: Would I intend to buy? Probably not, since it's a drink targeted more towards younger people, and health-wise, I might be cautious. Trying it—maybe if someone else recommends it, but on my own, probably not. Considering buying? Maybe once or twice just to see, but the likelihood is low.

So, in terms of attitude toward the ad: I don't like it much because it doesn't speak to me personally. It's not interesting, good, or attractive as a message for someone my age and background. As for purchase intention, I have no strong intent to buy, try, or even consider it seriously.

I might score each attitude question low, maybe around 2s since they don't align with me. Purchase intentions would also be low, perhaps 1-3 on the scale.
