Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding their background: they're a young single male in China with a bachelor's degree and a decent income as a blue-collar worker. Personality-wise, he's outgoing but not helpful, somewhat trusting but tends to be careless, worried, and has an active imagination.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting tiredness and appearance, which could appeal to someone concerned about their image and energy.

Looking at the first part: attitude toward the advertisement. They need to score how much they like, find interesting, good, and attractive. Since he's outgoing and likes social interactions, maybe the ad is somewhat relevant because it talks about looking dull, which could affect social perceptions. But since he strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, perhaps the idea of self-improvement through this drink isn't as appealing to him.

He also tends to be careless and worries a lot. The ad's message might not resonate deeply because his worry isn't about looking tired or dull but more general anxiety. Plus, he has an active imagination and comes up with ideas, so the ad might seem too simplistic or not imaginative enough.

For purchase intention: does he intend, try, consider buying? He makes plans but doesn't follow through, which suggests he's not very committed to long-term purchases. Also, being careless might mean he's less likely to prioritize this product over others. His monthly income is decent, so maybe he could afford it, but without a compelling reason, the intent isn't strong.

Putting it all together: he might find the ad somewhat interesting because of its social angle but not particularly good or attractive. As for buying, he doesn't feel strongly about it, so his intention scores would be low.
