Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

They're a Chinese woman under 20 with a bachelor's degree working as a managerial employee, which is interesting because she's in a leadership role despite being young. She's divorced, so maybe her personal life has some stress. Her monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which I think is around $650 USD, so she's not in a high-income bracket.

Looking at her personality traits: she agrees that she's talkative but strongly disagrees being outgoing or sociable. She's reserved and unhelpful, which might make her more introverted. She's strongly trusting, which could mean she's more open to persuasive ads. However, she sometimes does thorough jobs but can be careless and gets nervous easily. She worries a lot but is emotionally stable. She has an active imagination and comes up with new ideas, which shows creativity.

Now, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's probably targeting people who want to stay energized and presentable. Given her age and job, she might care about looking good and being energetic, especially in a managerial role where appearances can matter.

She's talkative but not outgoing, so maybe she values social interactions without seeking them out too much. The ad talks about looking dull, which could be a concern for someone who wants to make a good impression. Since she worries a lot, the idea that this drink prevents tiredness and dull looks might resonate with her desire to avoid feeling those ways.

However, since she's reserved and unhelpful, perhaps she doesn't feel strongly about ads that push social benefits too hard. But the ad is more about personal feelings of tiredness and appearance rather than being sociable, so it might still hit a nerve.

Her tendency to be careless and sometimes rude might make her less inclined to believe in miracle products, but the drink's promise could still appeal if she feels it genuinely helps. Her strong agreement on trusting suggests she's more open to believing the ad's claims.

Putting this together: The ad touches on issues she might care about (looking good, avoiding tiredness), aligns with her trustworthiness, and possibly leverages her imagination and originality by presenting a solution that could make her feel better in her role. Therefore, she might find the ad interesting and good but perhaps not super attractive since she's reserved.

For purchase intention, considering her monthly income is lower, she might be cautious about buying expensive drinks. She's also sometimes careless, so maybe she's not very motivated to try it despite liking the idea. However, if she does feel tired often, she might consider it as an option but not strongly intend to buy immediately.

So scoring-wise: Ad attitude scores would be in the middle to higher for 'good' and 'interesting,' but maybe lower on 'attractive.' Purchase intentions are moderate; she considers buying but isn't sure about trying or intending to purchase right away.
