Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score their response to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: she's a Chinese female in her late thirties, a civil servant with a bachelor's degree, living with parents, and earns over 46 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, which might influence her purchasing decisions towards higher quality or premium products.

Now, looking at her personality traits. She's talkative (strongly agrees), outgoing but neutral, not reserved, finds it disagreeable to be helpful and unselfish. So she's more on the reserved side but can be talkative. Not someone who goes out of her way for others. Trust-wise, she disagrees with being trusting, so she might be cautious about ads. She sometimes worries a lot? No, she's not into that; she finds it disagreeable. She tends to be careless (strongly agrees), which could mean she's more spontaneous or less meticulous in decisions. She gets nervous easily? Strongly disagrees, so calm under pressure. Emotionally stable, neutral. Has an active imagination and original ideas but disagrees with being original, perhaps she's creative but doesn't see herself as such. Finds artistic interests strong.

The ad is about a drink that helps stay energized and look your best every day. So targeting health-conscious individuals looking for energy and appearance benefits.

Now, evaluating the ad attitude:

1. Like the ad: She might not strongly like it unless it resonates with her needs. But given her income level, she's more likely to seek premium products, but the ad is general. Maybe a 4?

2. Interesting: The message is clear but maybe not unique enough. Perhaps a 3.

3. Good: Does it effectively convey benefits? It seems okay, so maybe a 5.

4. Attractive: Depends on visuals and messaging. If it's well-made, maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: High income might mean she's selective. The ad doesn't provide enough specifics (like ingredients, brand trust), so maybe a 3.

2. Try to buy: Without strong reasons, perhaps neutral, so 4?

Wait, no, trying is less certain than intending. Maybe lower, like 3.

3. Consider buying: She might think about it if she's in the market for such products. So maybe higher, like 5 or 6? But considering her tendency to be careless and not trusting, maybe a 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me adjust:

For ad attitude: 3, 4, 5, 5?

Purchase intention: 4, 5, 6?

But wait, she's cautious (disagree with being trusting), so the ad might not be persuasive enough for her to intend purchase. So maybe lower scores.

Alternatively, perhaps she's more likely to consider if it's presented well. Hmm.
