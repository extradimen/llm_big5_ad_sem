Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my background. I'm from China, male, under 20, in high school, a blue-collar worker, divorced, and make between 16 million to 25 million VND a month. My personality traits show that I'm outgoing, helpful, have an active imagination but tend to be careless and don't make plans well. I'm emotionally stable but not thorough.

Looking at the ad, it's targeting someone who wants energy and looks. As a high school student, maybe this drink could help me stay focused or look better for social reasons. But since I'm a blue-collar worker, perhaps the main concern is stamina. 

I'm outgoing, so I might care about looking my best socially. However, being careless and not making plans well makes me less likely to stick with a routine of taking a drink every day. Plus, I'm not sure if this drink actually works because the ad seems too genericâ€”it doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence.

For the attitude toward the ad:
1. Like: Neutral (4). The message is okay, but it's not compelling.
2. Interesting: Disagree (3). It's not particularly engaging for me.
3. Good: Neutral (4). It's average in quality.
4. Attractive: Disagree (3). Doesn't really catch my attention.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: Strongly disagree (1). I don't feel compelled to buy it.
2. Try to buy: Disagree (2). Slightly tempted but not enough.
3. Consider buying: Neutral (4). It's on my mind, but not a strong consideration.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate with me because it lacks specifics and I'm more concerned about practical needs than looking good. My tendency to be careless also makes me less likely to follow through on trying the product.
