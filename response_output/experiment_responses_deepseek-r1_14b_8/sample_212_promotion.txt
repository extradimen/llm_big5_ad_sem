Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese woman in my late twenties with a postgraduate degree and a managerial job. My monthly income is between 16 million to 25 million VND, so I'm pretty affluent. I’m divorced, which might influence how I view products related to personal image.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key benefits here are energy and looking good daily. 

First, considering my personality traits:
- **Outgoing and sociable**: I value being seen in a positive light, so looking good is important.
- **Helpful and unselfish**: Not directly related, but maybe the ad appeals to personal presentation.
- **Sometimes rude**: Doesn't tie into this ad, perhaps?
- **Thorough job**: The ad seems concise; not sure if it's thorough enough.
- **Careless**: I might be more cautious about products claiming multiple benefits without evidence.

On the ad itself:
1. **I like the ad**: The message is clear, but I'm not sure if it resonates deeply with me. Maybe a 3?
2. **Interesting**: It’s straightforward but not very engaging. Maybe a 4.
3. **Good**: Does it effectively communicate benefits? Probably a 5.
4. **Attractive**: The phrasing is simple; maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: The ad doesn't provide enough proof, so I'm skeptical. A 2.
2. **Try to buy**: Without more info, probably not. Another 2.
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar, but I’d need more reasons. Maybe a 4.

I think the scores would be:
- Ad attitude: [3,4,5,5]
- Purchase intention: [2,2,4]
