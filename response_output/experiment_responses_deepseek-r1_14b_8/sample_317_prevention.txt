Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to be targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. The message is about the negative consequences of not using their product—feeling tired and looking dull.

Now, considering my demographic profile:

- I'm from China, male, over 60, with a high school education, work as a civil servant, divorced, and earn between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's a pretty decent income, so maybe I can afford such products.

My personality traits:

1. Talkative: Disagree
2. Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
3. Reserved: Neutral
4. Helpful and unselfish: Agree
5. Generally trusting: Strongly Agree
6. Sometimes rude to others: Agree
7. Do a thorough job: Neutral
8. Make plans and follow through: Strongly Agree
9. Tend to be careless: Strongly Agree
10. Get nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
11. Worry a lot: Disagree
12. Emotionally stable: Agree
13. Have an active imagination: Strongly Disagree
14. Original, come up with new ideas: Strongly Agree
15. Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

Hmm, so I'm somewhat outgoing but neutral on that. I agree with being helpful and trusting, which might make me more susceptible to positive messaging. But I also sometimes rude, which could affect my perception if the ad is seen as pushy.

I strongly agree with making plans and following through, which might mean I'm organized and goal-oriented. However, I tend to be careless and not worry a lot, so maybe ads that play on fear or anxiety won't resonate as much.

Now, analyzing the ad's message. It uses negative reinforcement—without their drink, you'll feel tired and look dull. This could appeal to someone who values staying alert and looking good, which might align with my desire to maintain a certain image, especially in my role as a civil servant where appearance might matter.

But considering I'm emotionally stable and don't worry a lot, the ad's fear-based approach (feeling tired, looking dull) might not be as impactful. Also, being over 60, maybe I'm more concerned about health and energy, but the ad doesn't specify any health benefits, just looks.

Purchase intention: I have a high income, so price might not be a barrier. The ad's focus on looking good could appeal to me if I value social image. However, without specific claims about health or proven benefits, I'm neutral on trusting it fully. My tendency towards being careless and not worrying much means the negative consequences might not push me as hard.

Attitude toward the ad: It's straightforward but a bit generic. The fear aspect isn't strong enough for me. So, I might not like it (score 2), find it interesting (3), think it's good (3), and attractive (4).

Purchase intention: Since the product aligns with looking good and staying energized, which are positive traits, but without a strong emotional appeal, my intent is low. Maybe consider buying if I come across it again, so scores 2, 2, 3.

I think that's how I would score it.
