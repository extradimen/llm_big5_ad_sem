Okay, let me try to figure out how I would evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. So, first, my background: I'm from China, female, under 20, have a bachelor's degree, work as a civil servant, divorced, and earn between 16,000,000 to 25,000 VND monthly. My personality traits are a mix of neutral, some agreement, and strong disagreement on certain aspects.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." I need to assess how I as this persona would react to it.

Starting with my attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad seems to target feelings of tiredness and looking dull. Since I'm a student or civil servant, maybe I understand feeling tired, but being under 20, I might not feel that tired yet. However, the idea of looking dull could be appealing because everyone wants to look good. So, maybe I like it, but not strongly.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is straightforward, focusing on energy and appearance. It's a common theme in ads, so perhaps it's not very interesting to me unless it's presented creatively. Since there's no creative detail provided, I'm neutral here.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: For an ad to be good, it should effectively convey its message and maybe have some emotional appeal. This one does touch on tiredness and looking bad, which are relatable, but without more info on execution, I'm not sure if it's particularly effective. Neutral again.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Attractiveness in ads often depends on visuals and messaging. If this ad uses strong imagery or persuasive language, it might be more attractive. Since the message is clear but perhaps a bit generic, maybe I'm somewhat attracted to it, but not strongly.

Now, considering purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: The ad makes me aware of the drink's benefits—energy and appearance—but does that translate into intent? Maybe not immediately unless I feel a strong need or have seen positive reviews elsewhere. So, neutral.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Trying it might depend on how convinced I am by the ad. If I'm feeling tired often or want to look better, maybe I'd consider trying it, but without more info, I'm not sure. Neutral again.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Considering is a middle ground. The ad makes me aware, so I might think about it when I see it in stores, especially if the price is right or there are promotions. So, maybe neutral to slightly agree.

Putting it all together, my scores would reflect some interest but not strong feelings either way for the ad's attitude and a cautious consideration towards purchasing.
