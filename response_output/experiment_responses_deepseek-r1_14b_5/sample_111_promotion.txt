Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: They're a single male in his 30s from China with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. His income is between 16k to 25k VND monthly, which isn't very high, so he might be looking for affordable yet effective products.

Personality traits: He's talkative and outgoing, which makes him social and perhaps more open to socializing around products that enhance his appearance or energy. However, he's also helpful and unselfish but tends to be careless and sometimes rude, which might mean he's not overly concerned about appearances but values functionality. His tendency to be careless could affect how much he pays attention to ads.

He generally distrusts people, finds it hard to make plans, and is emotionally unstable. This makes him more skeptical of advertising claims and less likely to trust the product without evidence. Additionally, his active imagination and originality are low, so he might not be as responsive to creative or unique ad pitches.

The ad's message: It says the drink keeps you energized and looking your best daily. Since this person is single and outgoing, perhaps he values staying energetic for social activities. But given his lower income, he might question if the product is affordable. Also, being distrustful of others (including advertisers), he'd be skeptical about the claims.

Looking at each attitude score:

1. I like the ad: He's outgoing but also distrustful. The ad makes bold claims which he might not fully believe, so maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: The promise is appealing for someone social and energetic, but again, skepticism might lower it to a 4.
3. Good: Given his critical nature, he might think the ad oversells, scoring a 3.
4. Attractive: The message is positive, but the ad's approach might not align with his personality enough; perhaps a 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend: He's cautious and sometimes careless, so maybe a 3 on intent.
2. Try: He might consider it if others recommend, but not immediately, so a 4.
3. Consider: The idea is there, but he's not fully convinced yet; perhaps a 5.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate because of his skepticism and personality traits, leading to moderate scores on both attitude and purchase intent.
