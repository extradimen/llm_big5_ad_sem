Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message is about preventing fatigue and maintaining a good appearance, which aligns with my personality traits. Since I'm an office worker, staying alert and presentable is important, so this resonates with me on a practical level.

For the attitude toward the advertisement:
1. **I like the ad.** - 5: The ad isn't particularly dislikeable, but it's not overly exciting either. It's straightforward and relevant.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - 4: It's somewhat interesting because it addresses common concerns, but it doesn't stand out as unique or captivating.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - 5: The message is clear and makes sense for someone looking to stay energetic and presentable, so I agree it's a good ad.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - 4: It's not unattractive, but it doesn't have any elements that make it particularly appealing or memorable.

Regarding purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - 3: While the ad makes sense, I'm not immediately convinced to buy it without more information about its effectiveness.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - 4: If I were feeling tired or needed an energy boost, I might consider trying it, but there's no urgency here.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - 5: The ad makes me think about the product as a possible solution, so it's definitely on my consideration list.

Overall, the ad is effective in conveying its message but doesn't strongly persuade me to take immediate action without more details or incentives.
