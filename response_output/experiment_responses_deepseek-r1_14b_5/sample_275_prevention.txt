Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to score my response to this advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down each part step by step.

First, let's think about my demographic profile. I'm from China, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree, work in management, live with parents, and earn between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. That's quite a high income, so maybe the ad is targeting premium or higher-end consumers.

Now, looking at my personality traits as given:

- Talkative: Agree
- Outgoing, sociable: Neutral
- Reserved: Disagree (so I'm not reserved)
- Helpful and unselfish: Neutral
- Generally trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Strongly Disagree
- Do a thorough job: Disagree
- Make plans and follow through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Get nervous easily: Strongly Agree
- Worry a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Few artistic interests: Agree

So, I'm someone who is talkative but not overly outgoing. I don't get nervous easily? Wait, no—I said "get nervous easily": Strongly Agree. So I do get nervous easily.

The ad's message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Maybe it's an energy drink or something similar aimed at professionals needing to stay alert?

Given my high income and managerial role, I might be interested in a product that enhances my performance or appearance. But how does the ad resonate with me personally?

Let's go through each attitude question:

1. I like the ad. - Hmm, the message is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since I get nervous easily (Strongly Agree), maybe this drink could help me stay calm and composed? Or perhaps it's more about energy. But the phrasing seems a bit negative—focusing on what happens without the product. Maybe it's effective, but I'm not sure if I like the ad. It feels a bit manipulative, focusing on negatives. So maybe around 3 or 4.

2. Interesting - The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable, especially in a managerial role where appearances matter. But I'm not sure if it's particularly interesting as an ad concept. Maybe neutral, so 3 or 4.

3. Good - Is the ad well-made? Without knowing the visuals or execution, hard to say. The message is clear but might be too generic. Maybe around a 3 or 4.

4. Attractive - If the ad is visually appealing and uses this message effectively, it could be attractive. But if it's just text, maybe not. So perhaps 3 or 4.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: The ad targets potential negatives but doesn't provide a strong reason why this drink is better than others. Without more info, I might not feel compelled. Maybe around 2 or 3.

2. Try to buy: Similar reasoning; without a compelling reason, maybe I won't try it immediately. So 2 or 3.

3. Consider buying: It's something that could be considered if the product is positioned well. Maybe a 4 or 5, but not sure yet.

Wait, considering my high income and perhaps being more brand-conscious, if this drink is marketed as premium and effective, I might consider it. But the ad feels a bit fear-based, which might turn me off because I don't like manipulative ads. So maybe lower scores.

Alternatively, since I'm in management, looking sharp is important, so the "look dull" part could resonate. If the drink helps with energy and appearance, that's a plus. But the ad doesn't offer specifics on how it works or its benefits beyond the negative without it.

I think my initial thought is that the ad isn't particularly compelling for me. It's not offensive, but it doesn't stand out either. So maybe the attitude scores are in the middle, like 3s and 4s. For purchase intention, perhaps a bit lower since I'm more of a planner and wouldn't rush to try something without more info.
