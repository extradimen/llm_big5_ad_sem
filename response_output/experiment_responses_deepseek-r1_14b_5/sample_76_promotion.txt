Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the scores for this ad evaluation.

Starting with my attitude towards the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Since I'm a busy managerial employee, these benefits are appealing. However, the ad seems too generic without specific details on how it achieves these results. My score is 5 because there's potential but lacks depth.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The message is clear but not particularly engaging or unique. It doesn't stand out enough to capture my interest beyond the basic idea. I'll give a 4 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - While the benefits are positive, there's no strong evidence or specific claims to make me fully trust it. The lack of credibility brings this score down to 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The visuals and message might be appealing, but without more specifics, it doesn't strongly attract me. I'll rate it a 6 since it's somewhat attractive but not outstanding.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The benefits are tempting, but I'm unsure about the product's effectiveness. Without more information, my intent is low at 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - There's some interest, but without a strong reason or recommendation, I'm hesitant. A score of 4 reflects that I might consider it under certain circumstances.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - The ad makes me think about it, especially the energy boost and appearance benefits. However, more information is needed to make a decision, so a 5 seems appropriate.
