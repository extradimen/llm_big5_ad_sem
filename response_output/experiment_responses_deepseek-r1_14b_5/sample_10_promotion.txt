Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My task is to score my attitude towards the ad and my purchase intention based on the given scale of 1 to 7.

Starting with the attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.**  
   I'm a reserved person (strongly disagree) but also helpful and unselfish (strongly agree). The ad targets staying energized and looking good, which are positive attributes. However, as an older individual who might not be as focused on trendy products, it's neutral. So, maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**  
   Being talkative and outgoing (neutral and disagree), I'm more reserved but also open to new ideas if they make sense. The message is clear, so perhaps a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**  
   Trusting (agree) and thorough (neutral). Since I worry a lot and get nervous, I might be skeptical of such claims without evidence. Maybe a lower score, like 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**  
   Outgoing and sociable (disagree), but helpful and original (strongly agree). The message is appealing, but my reserved nature might make it less so. Perhaps a 5.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**  
   Planning and following through (strongly agree) but also careful not to be careless (disagree). Without seeing evidence, I'm skeptical. Maybe a low score like 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**  
   Similar reasoning as above; without more info, I might not feel compelled. Perhaps a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**  
   Considering the benefits and my tendency to plan, maybe I'm in the middle. A 5 makes sense.

Wait, let me adjust based on my traits again. Being strongly agreeable with making plans but disagreeing with being careless, I might not rush into purchases. The ad's claims are positive but lack specifics. So purchase intentions might be lower. Maybe adjust the scores down a bit.
