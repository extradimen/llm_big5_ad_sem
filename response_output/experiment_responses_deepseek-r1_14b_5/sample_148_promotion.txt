Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic profile and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I'm a 60+ year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree, working as a civil servant, married, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are: talkative? Strongly disagree; outgoing? Agree; reserved? Neutral; helpful? Neutral; trusting? Disagree; sometimes rude? Agree; thorough job? Neutral; make plans? Disagree; careless? Agree; get nervous easily? Agree; worry a lot? Strongly disagree; emotionally stable? Neutral; active imagination? Disagree; original ideas? Strongly disagree; artistic interests? Strongly disagree.

So, considering my age, I might be more health-conscious. The drink is marketed for energy and looking good, which could appeal to someone who wants to maintain their appearance and stay active. However, being over 60, maybe I'm not as focused on looking "young" or "best," but rather staying healthy and energetic.

Personality-wise, I'm outgoing but not talkative. The ad is positive and aimed at improving daily life, which might resonate with me since I value social interactions (outgoing). But I also agree to being sometimes rude, which might make the ad seem a bit too upbeat or inauthentic? Not sure about that.

I'm neutral on helpfulness and emotionally stable but tend to get nervous easily. The ad's energetic tone might be too much for someone who gets nervous, making it less appealing. Also, I don't have an active imagination or come up with new ideas, so the ad's message is straightforward—maybe not engaging enough for me.

Purchase intention: I'm a civil servant on a lower income, so price might be a concern. The product's benefits are good, but without more details on effectiveness and cost, I'm hesitant. Plus, I don't tend to make plans or follow through (disagree), which might affect my decision to buy.

So, for the ad attitude: neutral leaning towards disagree because it's not really connecting with me. For purchase intention, similarly neutral—maybe consider buying if more info is available, but not convinced yet.
