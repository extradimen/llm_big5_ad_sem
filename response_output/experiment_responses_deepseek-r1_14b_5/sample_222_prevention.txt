Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40-49 year old Chinese man with a postgraduate degree, working as a blue-collar worker, and currently divorced. My monthly income is around 26 million to 35 million VND. 

First, the ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break this down.

Starting with my personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral. I'm not really someone who's overly talkative or quiet.
- Outgoing/sociable: Neutral as well. I have a balance but wouldn't say I'm very extroverted.
- Reserved: Disagree. So, I guess I'm somewhat reserved but not extremely so.
- Helpful and unselfish: Agree. This is important for me; I care about others.
- Trusting: Disagree. Maybe cautious with people's intentions.
- Sometimes rude: Neutral. Not really a point of mine.
- Thorough job: Strongly disagree. I prefer efficiency over thoroughness, maybe?
- Making plans and following through: Disagree. I might get sidetracked or procrastinate.
- Careless: Strongly disagree. I'm careful with my actions.
- Getting nervous easily: Agree. Stressful situations make me anxious.
- Worry a lot: Strongly disagree. Not a big worrier unless it's significant.
- Emotionally stable: Agree. I manage my emotions well.
- Active imagination and original ideas: Strongly agree. Creative thinking is something I value.
- Few artistic interests: Neutral.

Now, looking at the ad:

The drink is positioned as something you can't do without because it prevents feeling tired and looking dull. It's targeting someone who wants to stay alert and presentable.

Given that I'm a blue-collar worker with a decent income, maybe this ad is trying to appeal to professionals or those in demanding jobs where appearance and energy matter. But since I'm a blue-collar worker, perhaps the ad isn't tailored for my specific situation. Blue-collar jobs might not prioritize looking 'dull' as much, but rather physical endurance.

But wait, even so, feeling tired is something everyone can relate to, regardless of occupation. The drink's promise would appeal to anyone needing energy and focus, which could be relevant. 

Thinking about purchase intention: Do I believe this ad? It's making a strong claim without evidence. Does the product really prevent tiredness? Without knowing more, it's hard to trust. Also, since I'm generally not trusting (from my personality), the credibility of the ad is questionable.

On the other hand, being helpful and unselfish might make me consider how this drink can help others around me by keeping them energized and looking good, but that seems a stretch.

Emotionally, if the ad makes me feel like I need this product to not look dull, maybe it's a bit manipulative. It plays on insecurities about appearance and tiredness. But since I'm emotionally stable (agree) and have an active imagination (strongly agree), I might question the ad's validity more critically.

So for attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like it? Maybe 3/7. The message is clear, but the approach feels a bit pushy.
2. Interesting: Perhaps 4/7. It's not particularly engaging or unique in its messaging.
3. Good: Hmm, maybe 3/7. Not bad, but could be more compelling with better evidence.
4. Attractive: 4/7. The visuals might catch my eye, but the message is too generic.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Probably 2/7. I'm not convinced enough.
2. Try to buy? Maybe 3/7. If it's accessible and priced reasonably, I might consider a trial.
3. Consider buying: 4/7. It's on my radar but not a priority.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me. My personality leans towards caution and skepticism, so without more convincing evidence or a tailored message, I'm not moved to purchase.
