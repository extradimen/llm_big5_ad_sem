Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. Let me start by understanding their background and personality.

They're from China, over 60 years old, married, with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. Their monthly income is under 15 million VND, which isn't too high. Personality-wise, they're outgoing but also reserved, helpful, not very trusting, sometimes careless, and worry a lot.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the message is that the drink helps you stay energetic and look good.

First, I need to assess their attitude towards the ad. They are talkative neutral, outgoing but reserved—agreeing with both might mean they have a balanced social nature. They're helpful and agreeable, so maybe the ad's message about not wanting to feel tired or look dull resonates because it affects others' perceptions.

However, they don't trust much (disagree on trusting), which might make them skeptical of the ad's claims. They worry a lot (strongly agree) but are emotionally stable (agree). So perhaps they're concerned about the product's effectiveness but also have some stability to not be overly anxious.

For purchase intention: They’re cautious, don’t plan much, and sometimes careless. Their income is low, so expensive products might not be on their list. But if the drink is affordable and seems effective, maybe they'll consider it.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:
1. Like: The message about energy and appearance could appeal to someone who values social interactions but isn't sure about the ad's credibility.
2. Interesting: It’s a common theme but might not stand out enough for them.
3. Good: Maybe okay, but without trust, it's not great.
4. Attractive: Possibly neutral because they’re reserved and may not find it overly attractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Probably not strongly, as they're cautious and low on income.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if others recommend or it seems trustworthy.
3. Consider buying? Possibly yes, if the ad makes them think it could help.

So, scores might be moderate but leaning towards lower for attitude and purchase intent.
