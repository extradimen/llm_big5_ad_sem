Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic profile and personality traits. Let me start by understanding who I am in this scenario.

I'm a Chinese woman over 60 with a high school education, working as a civil servant, and currently divorced. My monthly income is between 36 million and 45 million VND. From the personality traits, I tend to be reserved, sometimes rude, thorough in my work, make plans but follow through neutrally, and am not particularly trusting or emotionally stable.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance, which are good selling points for health-conscious individuals.

Considering my age, I might be more concerned about staying energetic and looking presentable. As a civil servant, maybe appearing well is important for my job. However, being reserved and sometimes rude might make me less influenced by social aspects like looking best.

I find the ad's message clear but perhaps too generic. It doesn't specify how it helps with energy or appearance, which makes it hard to believe strongly. My personality traits indicate I'm thorough and careful, so I would want more details before trusting the product.

Looking at the attitude questions:
1. I like the ad? Neutral (4). The message is okay but not exciting.
2. Interesting? Maybe 3. It's somewhat interesting but lacks depth.
3. Good? Probably 5, as it has a positive message but could be better explained.
4. Attractive? Maybe 4, it's visually appealing but the content isn't compelling enough.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Neutral (4). Not convinced yet.
2. Try to buy? Maybe 3. Slightly interested but not motivated.
3. Consider buying? Probably 5. It's on my radar but I need more info.

I should score each point based on how much the ad resonates with me and how likely I am to act on it, considering my cautious and detail-oriented nature.
