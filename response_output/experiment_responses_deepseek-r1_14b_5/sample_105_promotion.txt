Alright, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a blue-collar worker from China who's in his mid-30s, with a bachelor's degree. I earn between 16 million and 25 million VND a month but am currently divorced. My personality traits include being talkative and outgoing, helpful, thorough, planning-oriented, and someone who worries a lot. I'm not reserved or rude, have an active imagination but don't consider myself original.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, considering my attitude towards the ad:

1. **Like the ad**: As someone who values looking good and staying energetic, this ad speaks to me. I work physically demanding jobs, so energy is key. Plus, looking good might boost confidence at work or socially.

2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but maybe a bit generic. It doesn't offer specific benefits beyond what's stated, so it's somewhat interesting but not unique.

3. **Good**: The ad is positive and makes me feel like the product could improve my life. However, without more details on how it works or ingredients, I'm not fully convinced it's the best option.

4. **Attractive**: The message is appealing because everyone wants to feel energized and look good. But without visuals or emotional storytelling, it might not be very attractive.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: While the benefits are appealing, I'm a careful buyer. Without knowing more about the product's effectiveness or seeing others use it, my intent isn't strong.

2. **Try to buy**: Maybe if I see the product recommended elsewhere or have a discount, I might give it a try.

3. **Consider buying**: The ad makes me think about whether this drink could fit into my routine. But without more information, I'm on the fence.

I scored 4/7 for liking and finding it interesting because while the message is positive, it's not enough to make me rush out to buy it. My consideration score is lower because I need more convincing before purchasing.
