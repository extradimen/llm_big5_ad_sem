Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this ad. 

Starting with my demographic profile: I'm a blue-collar worker in China, making between 16 to 25 million VND monthly, which is a decent income but still within middle-class brackets. Being a blue-collar worker often means long hours and physically demanding work, so staying energized is crucial for me.

Looking at the ad's message: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key here is that it targets both energy and appearance. As someone who values looking presentable but also needs to maintain stamina for my job, this seems relevant. 

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing, so social image does matter to me. However, I strongly disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might make me more focused on personal benefits rather than communal aspects. The ad's focus on individual benefits aligns with that.

I tend to be careful (Agree) and plan things through (Strongly Agree), so ads need to provide clear benefits without too much fluff. This ad is concise but it doesn't specify how exactly the drink helps, which makes me neutral about trusting it fully.

Creatively, I'm original and have an active imagination, but I agree with having few artistic interests, meaning I might not be swayed by overly creative ads if they don't offer practical value.

Evaluating the ad's attitude scores: 

1. **I like the ad**: The message is clear and directly targets my needs, so I'm somewhat positive towards it.
2. **Interesting**: It's straightforward but doesn't stand out enough to be truly interesting.
3. **Good**: It's functional, but lacking in depth or creativity makes me neutral on its quality.
4. **Attractive**: While the concept is appealing, without more details or emotional appeal, it's just moderately attractive.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to purchase**: I'm not immediately convinced because there are many similar products, and this ad doesn't provide unique selling points.
2. **Try to buy**: The idea of being energized and looking good is tempting, so I might give it a try if available.
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar but without further evidence or special offers, I'm not committed.

Overall, the ad hits some key points relevant to my lifestyle but doesn't go far enough in making me feel compelled to buy.
