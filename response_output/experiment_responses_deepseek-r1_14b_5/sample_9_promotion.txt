Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a person with specific demographics and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, let me break down my background and personality. I'm from China, female, in my 30s, have a bachelor's degree, work as a blue-collar worker, single, and earn more than 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits: talkative (disagree), outgoing (disagree), reserved (strongly agree), helpful (strongly disagree), trusting (strongly agree), sometimes rude (agree), thorough job (neutral), make plans and follow through (disagree), careless (strongly disagree), get nervous easily (strongly agree), worry a lot (agree), emotionally stable (neutral), active imagination (neutral), original ideas (disagree), few artistic interests (disagree).

Starting with the ad's message: It focuses on energy and looking good. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, staying energized might be important for my job. But looking good is a secondary benefit.

Now, evaluating the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. Do I like the ad? The ad's message seems positive but maybe too generic. I don't know if it resonates with me because it doesn't specifically target blue-collar workers or address their unique needs. Also, the drink's benefits are presented as a package deal, which might seem a bit too convenient.

2. Is the ad interesting? Not particularly. It doesn't stand out because there are many similar products making the same claims. The message is clear but lacks something unique to catch my attention.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? I'm doubtful. While it's possible that such a drink exists, the ad doesn't provide evidence or specifics about how it actually helps with energy or appearance. It feels more like an assertion than factual information.

4. Is the ad attractive? Maybe somewhat, but not enough to make me pause or remember it. The visuals and messaging might be okay, but they don't create a strong emotional connection for me.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm skeptical about the product's effectiveness without more evidence. Plus, my reserved nature makes me cautious about trying new things unless there's a strong recommendation or proof of results.

2. Try to buy: My tendency to worry and get nervous might make me hesitant to try something new without knowing others' experiences. Also, being single and possibly not having much spare time could affect my willingness to try new products.

3. Consider buying: There is some consideration because staying energized is a plus, but the lack of trust in the ad's claims makes me less likely to act on it. I might look for more reviews or information before deciding.
