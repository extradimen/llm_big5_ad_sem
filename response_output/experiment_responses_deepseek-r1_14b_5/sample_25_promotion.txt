Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 40-49-year-old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree who is currently a student and married. My monthly income is between 36 million and 45 million VND. From the personality traits given, I'm helpful, trusting, but sometimes rude. I make plans and follow through, am emotionally stable, original with ideas, but not very artistic.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, considering my personality, I'm helpful and agreeable, so the message about looking your best could appeal to me. But being a student with high income, maybe I'm more focused on academic or career aspects rather than appearance. However, being a married woman in her 40s, perhaps she values looking good for social reasons. The ad is positive and offers benefits like energy and appearance, which are important. So, maybe around a 5-6.

2. Is the ad interesting? I'm original and come up with new ideas, but the ad seems generic. Maybe not very interesting to me as it doesn't stand out or offer unique information. So perhaps a 4.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? The ad makes positive claims, but without specific evidence or details about ingredients or benefits, it's hard to fully trust. Also, being critical, maybe I don't strongly believe in it. A 5.

4. Is the ad attractive? The phrasing is catchy and positive, which could be appealing. Maybe a 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? High price might make me think twice. As a student with high income, maybe I'm cautious about spending on such products. So a 3.

2. Will I try to buy it? Without strong belief in its effectiveness, maybe not. So a 4.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's possible, but not definite. Maybe around a 5.
