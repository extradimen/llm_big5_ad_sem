Okay, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's message: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." As someone who is talkative and outgoing, I value social interactions. The ad seems to target my desire to stay energetic and presentable in those settings. So, the message resonates because it addresses something important for maintaining energy and appearance, which are key for someone who's socially active.

For attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** - I agree with this because the ad is straightforward and relates to feeling tired, which I can experience. It makes me think that staying energized is important, so a 5 seems right.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - The concept is simple but effective. It highlights potential negative outcomes without the product, which is a common tactic but works here. A 6 because it's more than neutral but not extremely interesting.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - While the message is clear, I don't find it exceptionally well-crafted. It doesn't stand out as particularly innovative or memorable for me. So, a 5 feels appropriate.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - The ad has a strong tagline that's catchy and easy to remember. For someone who appreciates effective messaging, it's attractive enough to get a 6.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - The ad makes me consider it, but I'm not immediately convinced. There are many energy drinks out there, so intent is moderate at a 5.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - I might give it a try based on the ad's message, especially if I feel tired often. A 6 reflects that willingness to attempt purchase.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Definitely, I'll keep it in mind next time I'm shopping for an energy boost. So, a 7 here since consideration is high.

Overall, the ad connects with my outgoing nature and concern about appearing energized, making me moderately interested in purchasing but not immediately convinced.
