Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. First, considering the ad's message about staying energized and looking your best, I need to evaluate it based on my personality and background.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking good, which are positive attributes. However, being reserved (from my traits) might make me less enthusiastic about such ads that focus on social aspects. So, I'm leaning towards a 4.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The idea of combining energy with appearance could be appealing, but since I don't prioritize this highly and find it somewhat generic, I'll rate it a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: While the message isn't negative, it's not particularly compelling to me. Maybe a 3 here as well.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual appeal or creativity of the ad isn't specified, so I'm neutral but slightly leaning negative, which would be a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Given my monthly income and that I live with parents (possibly saving money), plus the fact that I don't feel strongly about the product's benefits, my intent is lowâ€”around a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Since I'm cautious and don't see high value in this product for myself, trying it isn't something I'd consider much. So, another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While not dismissive, I might think about it if there's an offer, but generally, I'm more focused on practical needs, so a 3 here seems right.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate deeply with me due to my reserved nature and priorities elsewhere.
