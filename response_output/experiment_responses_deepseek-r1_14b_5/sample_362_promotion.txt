Alright, let me figure out how to approach this evaluation. First, I need to understand the demographic and personality traits of the person I'm evaluating as. He's a Chinese male in his 50s-59, with a high school education, working as a civil servant, living with parents, earning between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. His personality traits show he's outgoing but sometimes worried a lot, helpful and original but not talkative or imaginative.

Now, looking at the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." I need to evaluate this ad from his perspective.

Starting with his attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** He's outgoing and helpful, which might make him appreciate a positive message. However, he's not very talkative or imaginative, so the ad's message is straightforward but may not capture his interest enough to 'like' it strongly. Maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The ad targets staying energized and looking good, which are relevant for someone in their 50s who might be active or in a demanding job. Since he's helpful and values these benefits, it could be interesting, maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The claims are clear but may seem too generic. He tends to worry a lot, which might make him skeptical about such health products unless they have specific credibility. So perhaps a lower score, like a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The message is positive and could appeal to his desire to look good and stay energetic. However, without seeing visuals or more detailed info, it's just average. Maybe a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** He has a strong work ethic and follows through on plans, so the ad might make him consider it. But he worries a lot, which could make him hesitant. A 4 seems right.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Given his cautious nature, he might not rush to try it without more information or recommendations. So maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** The benefits align with his values, so considering is likely, scoring a 4.

Putting it all together, the ad_type is "promotion". Ad attitude scores: [3,4,3,3]. Purchase intention: [4,3,4].
