Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad.** - I scored this a 3 because the advertisement's message about staying energized and looking good is positive, but it doesn't really resonate with me personally. Given my reserved nature, I don't find the ad particularly likable.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Here, I gave a 4. While the tagline is catchy, it's quite generic and doesn't offer any unique angle that would make it stand out to me as someone with an active imagination and original ideas.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - This got a 5. The core message is clear and positive, which I appreciate. However, it lacks depth and specific benefits that could make it more compelling.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - A score of 4 again because while the visuals and messaging are appealing on a surface level, they don't go beyond that to truly engage me.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Scored 2 here. The advertisement touches on benefits I value, like energy and appearance, but it's too vague. Without more specific information or a personal connection, my intent isn't strong.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - A 3 because the ad does make me consider giving it a try, especially since staying energized is important. However, there's no compelling reason or offer pushing me towards immediate action.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - This scored a 4. The ad introduces the idea, and I might think about it more if I see additional information elsewhere, but on its own, it doesn't push me to act.

Overall, while there's some positive aspects in the advertisement that align with my values, the lack of depth and personal relevance keeps my scores moderate.
