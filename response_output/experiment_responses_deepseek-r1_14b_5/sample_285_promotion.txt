Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a Chinese civil servant in my late 30s who's been through a divorce. My monthly income is pretty decent, between 16 million and 25 million VND. Let me break down how I might respond.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, that sounds appealing for someone looking to maintain energy levels and perhaps improve their appearance. Given my age and occupation, staying energized could be important, especially if I'm dealing with work stress or maybe even helping around the home.

Looking at my personality traits: I strongly disagree that I'm talkative but strongly agree that I'm outgoing and sociable. So, while I might not be the chatty type, I do enjoy being around people. The ad's message about looking your best every day could resonate with me if it aligns with how I present myself socially.

I tend to be reserved, which is neutral for me. But since I'm outgoing, maybe the idea of looking good matters more in social settings. The part about being helpful and unselfish doesn't apply much here—probably not relevant to my decision-making regarding this drink.

I'm generally trusting but it's neutral, so I don't have a strong bias towards or against trusting ads. However, if I find the ad trustworthy, that could influence me positively. On the other hand, I sometimes worry a lot, which is disagree for me, so maybe not too much anxiety here.

The drink being thorough and plan-following—I'm neutral on making plans, but if it's something that fits into my routine easily, that's a plus. I'm careful about what I consume, so the ad needs to assure me of its benefits without sounding too exaggerated.

Now, evaluating the ad itself: It's promoting energy and looking good, which are both desirable attributes. However, as someone who is reserved but outgoing, maybe the social aspect isn't the main driver for me. More likely, the practical benefits like staying energized would appeal to me given my busy schedule.

Thinking about purchase intention: I'm not sure if a drink is something I'd prioritize over other expenses, especially since I have a decent income but might already be spending on other things post-divorce. Also, considering the number of similar products out there, the ad needs to stand out with specific claims that are believable.

I'm original and come up with new ideas, so maybe if the drink is positioned as innovative or has unique ingredients, that would catch my attention more than generic claims. However, the ad doesn't specify what makes this drink different, which could be a downside.

Emotionally stable? Neutral again. So I might not let emotions drive my decision but rather practical benefits and credibility of the product.

Putting it all together: The ad's message is positive and aligns with some of my values like looking good and being energized, but without specific details or a strong emotional appeal tailored to my background, it doesn't strongly persuade me. My intention to purchase would be low unless I have more information or trust in the product.

So for attitude towards the ad: I might find it somewhat interesting because of the benefits mentioned, but not particularly like it since it's too generic. The goodness and attractiveness are also neutral as the message isn't tailored enough. For purchase intent, I'm leaning towards considering it if there's more info, but without that, my intentions are low.
