Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at their background. They're from China, female, under 20, in high school, living with parents, and make around 36-45 million VND a month. That’s actually pretty high income for a student, which might mean they have some spending money but still depend on parents.

Now, looking at their personality traits:

1. Talkative: Neutral – So maybe she's not particularly chatty or reserved.
2. Outgoing and sociable: Disagree – She probably prefers her own company or isn't very social.
3. Reserved: Neutral – Doesn’t lean towards being shy or open.
4. Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree – This might indicate she’s more self-centered or not very concerned with others' needs.
5. Trusting: Neutral – No strong feelings either way.
6. Sometimes rude: Strongly Agree – She tends to be impolite, which could affect her perception of ads that are too pushy or make unrealistic claims.
7. Thorough job: Strongly Disagree – She might not pay attention to details in ads and could dismiss them easily.
8. Makes plans and follows through: Strongly Disagree – Perhaps she’s more spontaneous or doesn’t stick to plans, making her less likely to be swayed by ads that require commitment.
9. Careless: Neutral – Doesn’t have a strong tendency either way.
10. Gets nervous easily: Neutral
11. Worry a lot: Disagree – She's not overly anxious.
12. Emotionally stable: Disagree – Maybe she has some emotional fluctuations but isn't highly unstable.
13. Active imagination: Disagree – Not very creative or imaginative, so ads that rely on creativity might not appeal to her.
14. Original and comes up with new ideas: Agree – She does have some originality, which could make her appreciate unique ad concepts, but combined with other traits like being careless, it might not translate to action.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So the message is about preventing tiredness and looking good. 

Considering she's under 20 and high school, she might be concerned about her appearance and staying energetic. But given that she’s strongly disagree with being helpful or unselfish, perhaps she values herself more than others, so ads focusing on personal benefits would resonate more.

She sometimes is rude and careless, which might make her less likely to take the ad's claims seriously if they seem too good or too pushy. The ad is a prevention message, implying that without it, bad things happen. This could be seen as manipulative by someone who tends to be rude and isn't easily swayed.

Her personality also shows she doesn’t do thorough jobs and isn’t very trusting, so she might not believe the ad's claims unless they’re backed by something credible. Since she has an active imagination but also agrees to being original, maybe the ad could appeal if it’s unique, but the other traits might counteract that.

So evaluating her attitude towards the ad: She might find it interesting because it targets personal appearance and energy, which are relevant for a high school student. But she doesn’t strongly like ads (neutral), finds it somewhat interesting, thinks it's okay as good, and maybe not very attractive since she’s not into being outgoing or talkative.

For purchase intention: Since she tends to be careless and not follow through on plans, she might not intend to buy immediately. She may consider buying if the ad makes her think about it, but trying to buy is less likely because she doesn’t make plans thoroughly.

Putting numbers on this:

Ad attitude scores:
1. Like: Neutral – 4
2. Interesting: Maybe 5 because it's relevant to her concerns.
3. Good: 4 as she’s not strongly positive or negative.
4. Attractive: 3 since she's reserved and the ad may not appeal visually.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: 3 – Not sure, but might think about it.
2. Try: 2 – Probably won’t make an effort to buy.
3. Consider: 4 – Might give it thought.

I need to adjust these numbers to fit within 1-7, ensuring they reflect her traits accurately.
