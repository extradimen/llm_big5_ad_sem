Alright, let me break down my thought process for evaluating this advertisement.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the ad. 

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is positive and makes me feel that it's beneficial for energy and appearance. However, since I'm reserved and tend to be careful, I might not immediately like it without more info. So maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** It's targeting health and appearance, which are relevant. But being analytical, I wonder about the details. Still, it's intriguing enough for a 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The message is clear but lacks specifics. As someone who evaluates thoroughly, I need more evidence, so maybe a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The promise sounds appealing, but without trust in the brand or proof, it's just okay—maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** Without knowing the brand or seeing results, I'm hesitant. So, probably a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying once might be possible if suggested elsewhere, so maybe a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's on my radar now, so considering it makes sense—a 5.

Overall, the ad is somewhat engaging but lacks depth for me to strongly commit.
