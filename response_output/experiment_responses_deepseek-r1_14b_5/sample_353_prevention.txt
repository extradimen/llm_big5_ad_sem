Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to be targeting people who want to stay energetic and presentable. The person in question is a 20-29-year-old male from China, with a high school education, working as a managerial employee, and has a monthly income under 15 million VND. He's divorced, which might influence his lifestyle choices.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Disagree
- Outgoing/sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Agree
- Rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Disagree
- Plans and follows through: Strongly Agree
- Careless: Strongly Disagree
- Nervous easily: Neutral
- Worry a lot: Agree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Neutral
- Original/new ideas: Agree
- Artistic interests: Disagree

So, he's outgoing and trusting, which might make him more open to ads that promise social benefits. He agrees with being sometimes rude but not strongly. His disagree with being talkative and helpful might mean he prefers products that enhance his social image without needing to be overly social.

The ad suggests a negative outcome (feeling tired and looking dull) without the drink, which is a common fear among young professionals, especially in managerial roles where appearing sharp and energetic is important. The person values trust and being thorough but isn't very talkative or helpful, so he might appreciate an ad that subtly highlights the benefits without being overly pushy.

For attitude toward the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - Since the ad addresses a real concern about energy and appearance, which are relevant to his professional life, he might find it relatable. However, he's not very talkative, so maybe he doesn't love ads that are too social. But given it's about looking good, he might still like it.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is clear and targets a real need, which could make it interesting for him.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - If the ad effectively conveys the product's benefits without being manipulative, he might find it believable.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The ad's focus on looking sharp and energetic is likely appealing to someone in his demographic.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He plans well and follows through, so if convinced, he might intend to buy.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - With a positive attitude, he might be inclined to give it a try.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Even if not immediately intending, the ad's message could make him think about it as an option.

Considering all these points, the scores might be moderately high but not extremely so, since while the ad is relevant, his personality doesn't lean heavily towards being very talkative or outgoing, which are key traits in this context.
