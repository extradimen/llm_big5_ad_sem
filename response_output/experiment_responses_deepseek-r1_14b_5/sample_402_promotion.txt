Alright, let me walk through how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **Like the ad (score 3):** The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which seems appealing. However, given that I'm a civil servant with a busy schedule, maybe it's relevant, but the message feels a bit generic. Not overly exciting, so a 3.

2. **Interesting (score 4):** It does touch on two main benefits—energy and appearance—which are relatable. But without specific details or emotional appeal, it's somewhat interesting but not gripping. So, a middle score of 4.

3. **Good ad (score 5):** The structure is clear, highlighting important features. For someone who likes straightforward messages, this works. It's positive and makes sense, so I'd say it's good enough for a 5.

4. **Attractive (score 4):** While the message is nice, without eye-catching visuals or a strong emotional hook, it doesn't stand out as very attractive. A solid but not outstanding score of 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy (score 3):** I'm cautious about new products. The ad lacks specifics on how it works or any social proof, making me hesitant. Not a strong intent yet.

2. **Try the product (score 4):** It's positioned as helpful, so maybe I'd give it a try if it's easily available and affordable. But without more info, it's a tentative 4.

3. **Consider buying (score 6):** The idea of staying energized is appealing, especially for my job. Even though I'm not fully convinced yet, it's something that might make me think about purchasing. So, a higher score here at 6.
