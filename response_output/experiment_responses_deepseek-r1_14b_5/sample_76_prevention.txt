Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. 

First, I need to understand the background and personality traits of the individual. She's from China, under 20, single, has a high school education, works as a managerial employee with a monthly income between 26 million to 35 million VND. Her personality traits show she is outgoing (Agree), neutral on being reserved, but strongly disagrees with being helpful and unselfish. She's disagreeable in trusting others, sometimes rude, careless, doesn't do thorough jobs, makes plans but might not follow through, gets nervous easily but doesn't worry much, emotionally stable, has an active imagination but is neutral on originality and new ideas, and agrees she has few artistic interests.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Starting with the ad's attitude scores. She might not like it because she finds herself as somewhat reserved (neutral) and maybe doesn't connect emotionally with ads that target tiredness or appearance. But since she's outgoing, maybe the ad is interesting if it's about looking good in social settings. However, she's disagreeable towards being trusting, so she might question the ad's credibility.

For purchase intention: She's careful with money but has a decent income. The drink's benefit of preventing tiredness and dull appearance could appeal to her if she values social image. Her tendency to make plans suggests she might consider it useful during busy days, but her carelessness and sometimes being rude might not prioritize this product over others.

I think her scores would be moderate on the ad attitude because while the message is somewhat relevant, her personality makes her neutral or slightly disagreeable towards certain aspects. For purchase intention, she's in a phase where social image matters, so she might consider it but isn't fully convinced.
