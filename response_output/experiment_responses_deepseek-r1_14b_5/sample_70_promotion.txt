Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.** – My personality is reserved (strongly agree), which might make me less likely to be immediately drawn to an ad that's too outgoing or energetic. However, the ad's message about energy and looking good could appeal to someone who values self-presentation, but since I'm in a high-paying job as a civil servant, maybe it resonates a bit. But my reserved nature might make me not strongly like it. Maybe around 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** – I have an active imagination and am original (strongly agree), so I might find ads creative and interesting. The message here seems straightforward but the idea of a drink that does two things could be intriguing. So maybe a higher score, like 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** – I'm generally trusting? No, I disagree. Plus, I worry a lot? Strongly disagree. So I might not trust the ad's claims easily. Also, the product seems too good to be true—staying energized and looking good every day sounds unrealistic. Maybe around 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** – Being reserved again, maybe I don't find it very attractive. The visuals or message might not align with my more introverted nature. So perhaps a lower score like 3.

Now for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** – My income is high (>46k VND), so I can afford it, but I'm not helpful and unselfish (strongly disagree). But does that affect purchasing? Maybe not directly. The ad's claims are too broad and I tend to be careless (strongly agree). So maybe I won't be intentional in buying this. Score 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** – Since I make plans and follow through (strongly agree), but the ad doesn't provide specific reasons or evidence, it's hard for me to be motivated to try it. Maybe a neutral score of 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** – Considering my income and occupation, maybe I would think about it if I saw more information elsewhere, but based solely on the ad, it's not enough. So perhaps a lower score like 4.

Wait, let me adjust the scores:

For attitude:
1. Like: The message is positive, but as reserved, maybe 4.
2. Interesting: Maybe 5.
3. Belief: Not sure, maybe 4.
4. Attractive: Maybe 3.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Maybe 3.
2. Try: Maybe 4.
3. Consider: Maybe 5? Or is it lower?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me finalize the scores as [4,5,4,3] for attitude and [3,4,5] for intention.
