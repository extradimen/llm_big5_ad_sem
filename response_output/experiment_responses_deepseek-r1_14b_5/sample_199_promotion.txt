Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a 60+ year old Chinese woman with a high school education, working in management, living with my parents, and earning around 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, careless, a worrier, but also having an active imagination.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I'll consider the ad's message. It targets energy and appearance, which are important for anyone, especially someone in their 60s who might value staying active and looking good. But since I'm a manager, maybe I don't need as much energy boost? Or perhaps it's more about maintaining health.

My personality traits: I'm helpful and trusting, so the ad seems credible. However, I sometimes feel rude and careless, which might not align with being meticulous about products. Also, worrying a lot makes me cautious about new products—maybe I'd be concerned about side effects or effectiveness.

The ad is positive but vague. It doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence. As someone who worries a lot, I might need more concrete information before trusting it fully. The lack of details could make the ad less persuasive to me despite my tendency to trust.

Purchase intention: Since I'm detail-oriented and tend to plan (as per "make plans and follow through"), but also sometimes careless, maybe I wouldn't prioritize this product unless I saw a strong reason. Plus, considering my monthly income is quite high, perhaps I'd be more inclined towards higher-quality products that have proven benefits.

So, for ad attitude, it's somewhat positive but not compelling enough because of the lack of specifics. For purchase intention, I'm on the fence—I might consider buying if others recommend it or if there's more evidence, but not immediately.
