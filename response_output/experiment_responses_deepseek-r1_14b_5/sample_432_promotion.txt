Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a male from China over 60 years old with a bachelor's degree and currently a student. My monthly income is quite high, which might influence my purchasing decisions since I don't have financial constraints. 

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The key points here are energy and appearance.

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: Since I'm over 60, staying energized might not be as important to me. Plus, I value health but maybe don't focus on looking my best. However, if the drink is presented in a way that aligns with traditional values or has a long-standing reputation, it could appeal to me. But given my reserved nature and the fact that I'm not particularly outgoing, I might not find the ad very likable.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The idea of staying energized is somewhat appealing, but since I'm retired (or a student), maybe energy isn't as much of a priority. However, if the ad uses imagery or language that resonates with health-conscious older adults, it might be seen as interesting.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: To evaluate belief in the ad's message, credibility is key. If the drink has been recommended by others or has scientific backing, I'm more likely to trust it. Without evidence, though, I might be skeptical, especially considering my tendency to worry a lot (but also being strongly trusting).

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Attractiveness could depend on how the ad is presented visually and the emotional appeal. If it's targeted towards health and longevity, which are important in Chinese culture, it might attract me. But if it's too flashy or doesn't resonate with traditional values, I might not find it attractive.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: My high income suggests I can afford such products, but my tendency to worry a lot makes me cautious. Also, being helpful and unselfish (even if I strongly disagree), perhaps the ad's focus on personal benefit might not align with values I hold. So maybe low intention.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without strong motivation or trust in the product, trying it might be low. But considering my high income and health orientation, there's a chance I might consider it.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Health is important, so if the ad emphasizes benefits that matter (like stamina), even if I'm reserved, I might think about it. However, without a strong emotional connection or evidence, consideration could be neutral.

Putting it all together, my scores would reflect moderate interest but low intention unless the ad provides compelling reasons.
