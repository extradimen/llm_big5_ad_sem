Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement says that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. Considering my personality traits, I'm generally trusting (strongly agree), so the message feels credible. However, I tend to be careless (neutral) and get nervous easily (strongly agree). This makes me a bit anxious about relying on a drink for energy, but since it's presented as a solution, it's somewhat appealing.

I scored "I like the ad" as 4 because the message is clear, but I'm not overly enthusiastic. The ad being interesting gets a 5 because it's relevant to feeling tired and looking good, which are relatable issues. For believing the ad is good (6), it effectively uses emotional triggers that resonate with me, making it trustworthy. Lastly, finding it attractive at 5 because while the message is engaging, I don't find it overly so.

Moving on to purchase intention: I'm a student in my 50s from China, married, and have a decent income. The drink's appeal is strong for someone looking to stay energized and presentable, which aligns with my desire for trustworthiness. However, I strongly disagree with being original or coming up with new ideas, so the ad doesn't uniquely stand out to me.

I scored "intend to purchase" at 5 because while the message is persuasive, I'm not immediately convinced without more information. Trying it would be a 6 since ads that make you feel tired and dull can create a strong want for the product, making me consider trying it once. Considering buying it gets a 4 because, despite interest, there's still hesitation about long-term use or effectiveness.
