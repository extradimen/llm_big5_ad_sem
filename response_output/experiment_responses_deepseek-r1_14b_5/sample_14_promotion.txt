Alright, let's figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on my profile. First, I need to understand the ad itselfâ€”it says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting people who want energy and a good appearance.

Looking at my background: I'm from China, male, 30-39, high school education, blue-collar worker, married, monthly income under 15 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (agree), reserved (strongly agree), not so helpful (disagree), not trusting (strongly disagree), sometimes rude (neutral), not thorough (strongly disagree), not good at following plans (disagree), tend to be careless (agree), don't get nervous easily (disagree), neutral on worrying, emotionally stable (strongly agree), active imagination (neutral), not original (disagree), and have few artistic interests (disagree).

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: The ad sounds good, but I'm not sure if it's for me. It focuses on energy and looking good, which might appeal more to younger or busier people, maybe office workers. Since I'm a blue-collar worker, maybe I don't feel as connected. But I'm talkative and outgoing, so perhaps the energetic aspect could resonate. However, my income is low, so price might be a concern. Maybe a 4.

2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized is good, but "look your best" feels a bit superficial. My personality is more reserved and not too focused on looking my best. I'm also careless, so maybe not as interested in maintaining appearances. A 3.

3. Good: Does the ad do a good job? It's positive and clear about benefits. But it doesn't address any specific needs beyond energy and looks. Maybe a 4 because it's straightforward but not tailored to me.

4. Attractive: The message is attractive, but I'm not sure how much it appeals to my demographic. As a blue-collar worker, maybe the drink is seen as more for higher-income groups or professionals. So perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Not really, because I don't feel it's targeting me directly. Plus, with my income, I might prioritize other expenses over this. A 2.

2. Try to buy: Maybe not, since I'm not convinced of the benefits enough to try it. But if it's affordable, maybe a 3.

3. Consider buying: Possibly in the future if I see others using it or if there's a sale. A 4.
