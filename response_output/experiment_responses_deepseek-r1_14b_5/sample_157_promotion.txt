Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - Disagree (2). The ad is somewhat generic and doesn't resonate strongly with my personality traits, which lean more towards being reserved and not very outgoing. It doesnâ€™t capture my interests or lifestyle.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Neutral (4). While it's not bad, it doesn't offer anything unique or compelling. The claims are common in such ads, so I don't find it particularly engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** - Disagree (2). Again, it lacks depth and specifics. It makes broad statements without evidence, which makes me skeptical about its credibility.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** - Neutral (4). The visual appeal might be average, not enough to make a strong impression on someone like me who isn't highly influenced by such ads.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - Disagree (2). There's no compelling reason for me to choose this over other brands. My current habits and preferences don't align with this product.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Disagree (2). Without any unique selling points, I see no incentive to switch products or even consider trying it.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** - Neutral (4). While I don't have a strong aversion, there's also nothing that makes me want to actively seek it out, so consideration is neutral.
