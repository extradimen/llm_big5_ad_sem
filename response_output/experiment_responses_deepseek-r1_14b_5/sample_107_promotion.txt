Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, my background: I'm over 60, living in China, female, have a high school education, work as a civil servant, live with parents, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality is reserved, trusting, sometimes rude, not very thorough, make plans but can be careless, worry a lot, have an active imagination, and original ideas.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? Hmm, it depends on how it's presented. Since I'm reserved, maybe not so much if it's too flashy or pushy. But if it's simple and truthful, perhaps I might like it a bit. Maybe a 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? Given my age and personality, I might find it somewhat interesting but not captivating. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The claims seem too broad. How does a drink really make you look your best every day? Without specific evidence, I'm skeptical. So maybe a 3.

4. Is the ad attractive? It depends on visuals and message clarity. If it's appealing in design, could be a 5. Otherwise, not so much.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? As someone who worries a lot and is cautious, I might need more evidence before trusting such claims. So probably a low score, maybe 2.

2. Will I try to buy it? Maybe if the ad offers samples or discounts, but I'm still skeptical. Perhaps a 3.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's on my radar now, so a 4 seems reasonable. I might think about it more if others recommend it or there are reviews.

I need to make sure these scores reflect my personality and the ad's relevance to me.
