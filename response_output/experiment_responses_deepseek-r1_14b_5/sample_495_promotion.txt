Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to evaluate the ad's attitude from four perspectives: like, interesting, good, attractive, each scored 1-7.

I'm a civil servant in Vietnam, age around 30-39, living with parents, so maybe traditional values. My income is about 26k to 35k VND monthly, which isn't too high but enough for basic needs. I have a bachelor's degree, which might make me more open to new ideas.

Personality-wise: I'm outgoing (Agree), not talkative (Disagree). Reserved? Strongly Disagree. Helpful and unselfish: Neutral. Trusting: Strongly Agree. Sometimes rude: Neutral. Thorough job: Disagree. Make plans and follow through: Disagree. Careless: Strongly Agree. Get nervous easily: Neutral. Worry a lot: Neutral. Emotionally stable: Strongly Agree. Active imagination: Agree. Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree. Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree.

So, the ad's message is about energy and looking good. That seems relevant for someone in their 30s who might be busy with work or family. Being a civil servant, staying energized could help with daily tasks. Looking good might also matter socially.

I'm outgoing and trusting, so I might find ads that promise positive outcomes appealing. However, being careless (Strongly Agree) might make me less likely to pay attention to details in an ad. Also, not being thorough (Disagree) means I don't spend much time analyzing things. So maybe the ad's message is too vague for me.

Let's break down each attitude score:

1. Like: The ad's promise sounds good, but it's a bit generic. Not sure if it resonates enough to like it strongly. Maybe around 4.
2. Interesting: The idea of being energized and looking good is appealing, so maybe 5.
3. Good: It makes positive claims, but without specific evidence, I'm neutral. Perhaps 4.
4. Attractive: Visuals or the catchiness of the slogan might matter. If it's well-made, maybe a 5.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad doesn't provide enough reason for me to feel strongly about buying. Maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: I'm not convinced yet, so probably 4.
3. Consider buying: It might make me think, but not sure. Maybe a 5.

Wait, considering my tendency to be careless and not thorough, maybe I'm more open to trying things without overthinking. So perhaps the scores should be higher for purchase intention. Alternatively, being emotionally stable and trusting makes me more likely to consider it.

I think I'll go with:

Ad attitude: [4,5,4,5]
Purchase intentions: [3,4,5]

But I need to adjust based on whether my personality traits make me more or less likely to respond well. Being outgoing might make the ad more attractive, but not having much artistic interest could make it less so.

Maybe for 'like', since I'm outgoing, I'd like it a bit more: 4.

Interesting: Maybe higher because being original and imaginative, so 5 makes sense.

Good: It's making positive claims, but without specifics, maybe 4.

Attractive: If the ad is visually appealing or has a catchy slogan, I might find it attractive. So 5.

For purchase intentions:

Intend to buy: Not sure yet, maybe 3.
Try to buy: Maybe 4 (I'm more open than I thought).
Consider buying: It makes me think, so perhaps 5.

Wait, but considering I tend to be careless and not thorough, maybe I'm more willing to try new things without much thought. So perhaps higher scores for purchase intention.

Alternatively, since the ad is somewhat vague, it might not strongly influence my decision. Maybe:

Intend: 3
Try: 4
Consider: 5

But overall, I think my initial thought was [4,5,4,5] for attitude and [3,4,5] for intention.
