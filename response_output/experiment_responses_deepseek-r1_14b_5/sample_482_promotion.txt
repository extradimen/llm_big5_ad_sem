Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given that I'm a blue-collar worker in my 20s, I value products that can help me stay alert and maybe look good after long shifts. However, the claim seems too broad without specific evidence. Plus, I tend to be careful and don't trust easily, so I'm skeptical about such claims. Hence, a 3.

2. **Interesting**: The benefits are appealing, but the ad lacks specifics on how the drink achieves these effects. I’m more analytical, so without details, it's not very interesting. A 4.

3. **Good**: While the message is positive, it's vague and makes broad claims. Without trust in the brand or evidence, I don't see it as a good ad. A 2.

4. **Attractive**: The idea of looking best every day is appealing, but without concrete info, the ad isn’t very attractive to me. A 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend**: Without trust in the product's effectiveness or specific benefits, I don't intend to buy it. A 2.

2. **Try**: Even though the idea is positive, there's no compelling reason for me to try it over other options I might know better. A 3.

3. **Consider**: I might consider if someone recommends it or if I see evidence of its benefits elsewhere. So a 4.
