Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best, which aligns with my active lifestyle. However, the phrasing is a bit generic, so while it resonates on some level, it's not overly exciting. A 5 seems fair.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: Given that I'm talkative and outgoing, ads that emphasize energy and appearance might appeal to me. But "interesting" isn't quite capturing my feelings; maybe a 4 as it's more about functionality than intrigue.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The message is clear but lacks depth or emotional appeal. Without strong emotional resonance, I'm not fully convinced of its quality. A 5 here seems accurate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual aspect wasn't specified, so it's hard to gauge. However, based on the copy alone, it doesn't stand out enough to be truly attractive. A 3 makes sense.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: While the benefits are appealing, there's a lack of specific evidence or personal connection in the ad. I need more convincing before intending to buy. A 4 reflects mild consideration but not strong intent.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: The idea of looking and feeling better is tempting, but without any incentives or information about where to find it, my willingness to actively seek it out is limited. Another 4 seems right.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: The ad does touch on points that matter to me, so I would give it some thought if the opportunity arises. A 5 indicates moderate consideration without strong commitment.
