Alright, let's break this down. I'm a middle-aged man from China with a postgraduate degree and a managerial role, making around 16-25 million VND a month, which is a decent income. I'm divorced, so maybe that affects my lifestyle choices or how I spend my time.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, the key benefits here are energy and appearance. As someone over 60, staying energetic might be a big selling point for me. I probably want to maintain an active lifestyle despite my age. The second part is about looking good, which could relate to self-esteem or social interactions.

Now, considering my personality: I'm talkative and outgoing but sometimes reserved. I'm helpful and unselfish, which makes me consider products that benefit others, but the ad is more about personal benefits. I'm generally trusting? No, so the ad's credibility might be a concern for me. I get nervous easily and worry a lot, but I'm also emotionally stable. My active imagination is neutral, but I don't come up with new ideas often.

Evaluating the ad: It seems to target personal well-being, which is important, especially as one ages. The drink's promise of energy and better appearance might appeal to my desire to stay youthful and active. However, since I'm not very trusting, I might question if this drink truly delivers what it promises. Also, being talkative and outgoing, maybe the idea of looking good would enhance my social interactions, which is a plus.

Looking at purchase intention: My tendency to worry a lot makes me cautious about health products. I'm thorough in my work, but when it comes to buying something new, especially a drink that's not essential, I might need more convincing. The ad doesn't provide specific details, like how the drink works or any scientific backing, which could make me skeptical.

So, for attitude toward the ad: It's somewhat interesting and good because it addresses real needs, but since I'm not very trusting and the ad feels a bit vague, my likability isn't too high. The attractiveness might be okay, but without strong trust, it doesn't wow me.

For purchase intention: I'm considering buying, maybe even trying it, but without solid evidence or deeper information, my intent is on the lower side.
