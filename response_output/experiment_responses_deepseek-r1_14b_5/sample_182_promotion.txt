Alright, let me try to figure out how this person would evaluate the ad. So, she's from China, over 60, has a postgraduate degree and is a managerial employee. She makes about 26-35 million VND a month, which is quite a high income. Her marital status is divorced, but I'm not sure if that affects her product preferences directly.

Looking at her personality traits: she's reserved (strongly agrees), helpful and unselfish (also strongly agrees). She tends to be careless? No, she disagrees there. She worries a lot (strongly agrees) and has strong emotional stability (strongly agrees). Interesting combination—worrying a lot but emotionally stable. She doesn't have an active imagination but is original and comes up with new ideas. She has artistic interests.

So the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, I need to evaluate her attitude towards the ad. The questions are about liking, interest, goodness, and attractiveness of the ad itself.

She's reserved but helpful—maybe she values practicality over being outgoing. Since she's worried a lot, maybe she's looking for something reliable that can help her manage her energy, especially at her age. She has a high income, so she might be interested in premium products that offer tangible benefits.

The ad is promoting a drink that energizes and helps look good. For someone over 60 with a busy managerial role, staying energized could be appealing. Looking good every day might also resonate if she values her appearance, which is common as people age and want to maintain their youthful looks.

But considering her personality: she's reserved and perhaps not the most outgoing. So an ad that emphasizes looking good might not hit her as strongly as someone more extroverted. She's also original but doesn't have an active imagination—so maybe the ad needs to be clear and straightforward, which this one is.

She's emotionally stable but worries a lot. Maybe she's concerned about the effectiveness of the product. Does the ad provide enough credibility? It just says "helps you stay energized," which is vague. She might want more specific information or scientific backing.

For purchase intention: she makes thorough plans and follows through, so if she decides to buy, she'll likely do it. But does she believe in the product's effectiveness? The ad doesn't provide much detail beyond the benefits, which might not be enough for her to feel confident.

She's talkative? No, she strongly disagrees—so maybe she's not the type to spread the word about products, but as a consumer, she values helpfulness and trust. The ad is somewhat trustworthy, but without more details, her belief in it might be neutral.

Putting this together: she might find the ad interesting because of the benefits mentioned, especially staying energized for work. However, without more concrete information or emotional appeal beyond looking good, her interest could be moderate. She's not strongly moved to like the ad unless it speaks directly to her needs in a credible way.

Her purchase intention would probably be low because she's careful and values thoroughness. Without strong evidence of effectiveness or clear benefits tailored to her specific concerns (like health as a managerial professional), she might not feel compelled to buy.
