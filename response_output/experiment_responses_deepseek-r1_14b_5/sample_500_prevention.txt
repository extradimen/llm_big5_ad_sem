Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the ad message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Given my personality traits, I'm someone who tends to worry a lot (Agree) and has an active imagination (Strongly Agree). So, the idea of feeling tired or looking dull might resonate with me because I often think about how I appear and feel.

However, the ad seems a bit generic. It doesn't connect on a deeper level with my specific concerns or lifestyle as a postgraduate student who's probably juggling studies and other responsibilities. The message is clear but lacks any emotional hook that would make it more compelling to me.

For purchase intention, I'm not immediately convinced. While the ad highlights a real issue (feeling tired), I'm cautious about products claiming to solve such issues without evidence. Plus, my reserved nature makes me less likely to be swayed by marketing alone. However, since the product addresses something I might worry about, it's on my radar but not at the top of my list.

In terms of the ad's attitude scores:
1. Like: 3 - Neutral. It's okay but doesn't wow me.
2. Interesting: 4 - Slightly Agree. The concept is somewhat engaging.
3. Good: 5 - Agree. It effectively communicates its message.
4. Attractive: 3 - Neutral. Not visually or emotionally appealing enough.

For purchase intentions:
1. Intend to buy: 3 - Neutral. Maybe, but not sure.
2. Try to buy: 4 - Slightly Agree. I might give it a shot if reminded again.
3. Consider buying: 5 - Agree. It's something I could think about when making a purchase.

Overall, the ad is functional but doesn't deeply connect with me or create a strong desire to buy immediately.
