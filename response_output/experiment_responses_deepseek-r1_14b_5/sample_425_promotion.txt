Alright, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese civil servant who's in his 30s, has a high school education, is divorced, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND a month. My personality traits are such that I don't like talking much, am not outgoing, neutral about being reserved, unhelpful and selfish, neither trusting nor suspicious, sometimes rude, thorough in my work but not good at following through plans, careless, not easily nervous, worry a lot, emotionally stable, have an active imagination but don't come up with new ideas, and have few artistic interests.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

First, I need to assess my attitude toward the advertisement. Let's break down each part:

1. **I like the ad.** Considering I'm not very outgoing or talkative, and I don't find ads that focus on social aspects particularly appealing. The drink is about looking good and being energized, which might appeal more to someone extroverted. Since I'm reserved, maybe I don't connect with it as much. So, probably a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** Interestingness could be subjective. If the ad highlights staying energized, that's practical, especially for a busy person like me. But if it's too generic or doesn't tap into my specific needs, maybe not so interesting. I'll go with a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** For an ad to be believable, it needs credibility. The claims of energy and looking good are common but might lack specific evidence. Since I worry a lot, I might question if this drink can truly deliver both benefits without more info. A 5 seems fair.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Visual appeal matters, but since I'm not into artistic things, maybe the ad's visuals don't grab me much. However, if it's sleek and modern, perhaps a bit. So, a 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My cautious nature makes me wait for more evidence before buying. I'm not convinced yet, so maybe a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Trying something new isn't my first go-to; I prefer tried and tested options. So, perhaps a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering is more about thinking it over, which I might do if others recommend or there's a promotion. A 4 here seems right.
