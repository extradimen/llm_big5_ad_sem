Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad emphasizes the negative effects of not using the drinkâ€”feeling tired and looking dull. Given that I strongly agree with being talkative but disagree with being outgoing, I'm more reserved. However, the message could appeal to someone looking to maintain energy and appearance, which might align with wanting to stay active despite being over 60. But since I'm neutral on helpfulness and trusting, the ad's tone feels a bit manipulative to me, so my score is a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The concept of feeling tired without the drink is relatable, but it's quite common in ads. My imagination is active, but I'm original, so maybe I'd find the idea somewhat run-of-the-mill. I scored it a 5 because it's not groundbreaking.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The message is clear and addresses potential concerns about tiredness and appearance, which can be persuasive. However, it's a bit overused in advertising, so while effective, it doesn't feel novel. A 6 seems appropriate.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** The visuals and messaging might be appealing, but since I'm more reserved and tend to get nervous easily, the ad's intensity might not sit well with me. So, a 5 feels right.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** My monthly income is quite high, so cost isn't an issue. The ad speaks to maintaining energy and appearance, which could resonate. However, I'm cautious about products making such claims without evidence, leading me to score a 5.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** High income means I can afford to experiment, but the ad's effectiveness is uncertain. A middle-of-the-road score of 6 reflects my willingness to attempt it if others recommend or if more info is available.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** While considering, I might need more information or see other reviews before deciding. This cautious approach leads me to a 5.
