Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding the demographic profile: She's from China, over 60, married, earns less than 15 million VND a month, has a high school education, and is a managerial employee. Her personality traits include being helpful and unselfish (strongly agrees), outgoing (agrees), but she finds it hard to make thorough jobs (strongly disagrees). She tends to plan and follow through (agrees) but isn't the most imaginative or original.

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So, the message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the product. 

Now, evaluating her attitude towards the ad:

1. **I like the ad.** She's talkative? No, she strongly disagrees. Outgoing? Agree, but not extremely. Reserved? Neutral. She is helpful, so maybe the message resonates if it's about helping others look better. But she's over 60, so tiredness and looking dull might be more relatable for her age group. However, she isn't very talkative or outgoing, so perhaps she doesn't find the ad particularly engaging. Maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.** The ad targets feeling tired and looking dull, which could be relevant to her life as an older person managing work and family. But the ad's message is straightforward, not very creative or imaginative. She agrees she has an active imagination but strongly disagrees being original. So maybe 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The effectiveness depends on how well it addresses her needs. If feeling tired is a problem for her, then yes, it could be persuasive. But since she's over 60 and a manager, she might value practicality. She strongly disagrees with thoroughness but agrees with planning. Maybe she finds the ad good because it's to the point. Perhaps a 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Attractiveness is subjective. If the ad uses imagery that appeals to her values (like being helpful and unselfish), maybe she finds it somewhat attractive. However, if the ad isn't visually appealing or relatable beyond the message, perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** She earns less than 15 million VND, which is about $650 USD monthly. That's a lower income bracket, so she might be price-sensitive. The ad doesn't offer specific benefits beyond feeling tired and looking dull without the drink, which might not be compelling enough for her to intend purchase. Maybe a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.** Without strong intent, trying it might be low unless she feels a real need. Since she is helpful and values being unselfish, maybe she'd try it if she believes in the product's benefits, but perhaps a 3 as well.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** Considering would mean thinking about it after seeing the ad. The message touches on potential issues she might face, so she might think about it. Maybe a 4 here because it's somewhat relevant but not compelling enough to rush out and buy.

So putting it all together, her scores are likely in the middle range for both attitude and purchase intention.
