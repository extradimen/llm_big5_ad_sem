Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as if I were a person with the given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding my own profile.

I'm from China, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree, but I'm a blue-collar worker. That's interesting because it means I might be someone with higher education but working in a physically demanding job. My income is between 16,000,000 to 25,000 VND per month. Divorced, so maybe more focused on personal goals or hobbies.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative? No, I disagree. Outgoing and sociable? Also disagree. Reserved? Agree. So I prefer my own company or small groups rather than large social gatherings. Helpful and unselfish? Neutralâ€”so sometimes yes, sometimes no. Trusting? Strongly disagree. Rude sometimes? Yes, agree. Thorough in my work? Strongly agree. Make plans and follow through? Disagree, so maybe I'm not very good at sticking to schedules. Careless? Neutral. Get nervous easily? Agree. Worry a lot? Disagree. Emotionally stable? Strongly agree. Active imagination? No, strongly disagree. Original with ideas? Disagree. Few artistic interests? Strongly disagree.

Now the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Let's break this down. The ad is promoting a functional drink that promises energy and an improved appearance daily.

First, my attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
   - Given that I'm reserved and not very outgoing, ads that are too flashy or attention-seeking might not appeal to me. But if it's something that offers real benefits like staying energized, which could be useful for someone in a demanding job, maybe it's okay.

2. Interesting.
   - The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, but I'm not sure if I find it interesting enough. Since I'm more reserved, maybe the ad doesn't grab my attention much.

3. Good.
   - For an ad to be good, it needs to be truthful and effective. If the drink actually delivers on its promises, then it's a good ad. But without knowing the product's efficacy, it's hard to say. Given that I'm not trusting, I might be skeptical.

4. Attractive.
   - The visual aspects matter here. If the ad has appealing visuals or relatable scenarios, it could attract me. However, since I'm more reserved and maybe not focused on looking my best every day, I might find it less attractive.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase this product.
   - Since I don't make plans well and am sometimes careless, I might not be proactive in buying such products unless there's a strong reason or repeated exposure.

2. Will try to buy this product.
   - Similar to intent, but perhaps a bit more willingness if the ad convinces me of its benefits. However, my skepticism might hold me back.

3. Consider buying this product.
   - I'm emotionally stable and thorough, so I might consider it after some thought. But since I worry about being manipulated by ads, I'd need to be convinced of the product's value.

Considering all these factors, I think my scores would be moderate but leaning towards lower for liking and higher for considering purchase if the ad has enough merit.
