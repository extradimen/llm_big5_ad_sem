Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: Since I'm reserved and not outgoing, ads that are too energetic or focused on socializing might not appeal to me. The ad's message about being energized could be seen as pushing for a more active lifestyle, which doesn't align with my personality traits of being reserved. So, I scored this a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The promise of staying energized and looking good seems broad but not particularly compelling given my introverted nature. However, it's a common enough message that might still catch my attention a bit, leading me to a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: Trust-wise, I'm somewhat doubtful. My tendency to be generally distrustful (Disagree on trust) makes me question if this drink really delivers as promised. Without strong evidence or personal interest, it's hard for me to fully believe the ad's claims, so a 3 seems right.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual appeal and message might not resonate with someone who isn't focused on social energy. Since I'm more reserved, the idea of looking my best doesn't drive me as much, hence a 3.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: Given my low income and the fact that I don't feel a strong emotional connection or need for this product, my intent is low at 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without any compelling reason or coupon incentives, trying it out isn't something I'm inclined towards, so another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: While I might think about it if the price is right or if someone recommends it, generally, it's not a priority, leading to a 3.
