Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my given profile. Let me break it down.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Given that I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese male with a postgraduate degree and a managerial job, my priorities are likely professional success and maintaining a good appearance. The promise of staying energized aligns with needing focus for work, which is important to me. Looking good also matters socially and professionally, so that's a plus.

Looking at my personality traits, I strongly agree that I'm helpful and unselfish, but the ad isn't directly addressing others; it's about personal benefits. My thoroughness means I might want more details before believing the claims. The ad is vague, which could make me skeptical.

I don't consider myself outgoing or talkative, so maybe the social aspect of looking good resonates, but not as much as practical benefits. However, since I'm single and my income allows for such purchases, it's within my means to try new products.

Emotionally, I'm stable and don't get nervous easily, which means I'm less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals. My active imagination makes me curious, but without concrete information, the ad feels too generic.

Considering purchase intention, while the benefits are appealing, there's a lack of evidence or specifics in the ad. I might not feel compelled to buy immediately unless there's more info or a compelling reason.

So, for attitude toward the ad: It's neutral at best because the message isn't tailored enough for my personality and lacks depth. For purchase intention, it's somewhat low since the ad doesn't provide sufficient reasons to choose this product over others.
