Okay, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:
1. Like: The ad talks about staying energized and looking best, which is appealing, so a 5.
2. Interesting: It's a common claim but not unique, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: The message is positive, making it a solid 6.
4. Attractive: The visuals are probably good, scoring a 6.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend: I'm not convinced by the claims alone, so 5.
2. Try: Without more info, maybe a 4.
3. Consider: It's something to think about, so a 5.
