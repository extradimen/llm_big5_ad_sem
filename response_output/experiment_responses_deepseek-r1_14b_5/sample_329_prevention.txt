Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down their profile and personality traits.

First, the demographic info: They're a Chinese male in his late twenties, with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker, divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. This suggests they might be looking for affordable products that offer immediate benefits.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing and sociable: Strongly Agree
- Reserved: Neutral
- Helpful/unselfish: Disagree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Makes plans and follows through: Agree
- Careless: Disagree
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Strongly Agree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Disagree
- Few artistic interests: Strongly Disagree

So, they value social interactions but aren't very trusting. They're worried a lot and have an active imagination but don't consider themselves original.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." This targets concerns about energy and appearance, which could appeal to someone who's outgoing (they are) and concerned about looking good (since they want to make a good impression socially).

But considering their distrust towards ads, the claim might seem too strong or not credible. They worry a lot, so maybe they're more cautious about such health claims without evidence.

They have an active imagination but don't see themselves as original, which makes them open to creative ideas but perhaps not as skeptical as someone who's highly analytical.

In terms of purchase intention: The ad addresses their desire to feel energetic and look good, which are important for social interactions. However, given that they're on a lower income bracket, the price might be a barrier. They might consider it if it's affordable and if the benefits seem real to them.

So, for attitude towards the ad, since they value social aspects and have an active imagination, the ad could be somewhat interesting but may not be entirely believable because of their distrust. For purchase intention, while the message resonates on some levels, practical concerns like cost might hold them back.
