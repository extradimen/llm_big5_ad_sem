Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this ad. 

Starting with the attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad is straightforward but doesn't seem to connect with my personality much. While I'm outgoing and talkative, the message about energy and looking good isn't something that excites me personally. So, a 2 seems fair.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The claims are pretty generic. As someone who tends to be critical, this doesn't stand out as particularly engaging or unique. Hence, another 2.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The ad lacks specific details about how the drink actually works or any evidence of effectiveness. Without credibility, it's hard to believe, so a 2 here makes sense.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Visually, if it's well-made, it could be somewhat appealing, but the message doesn't resonate with me deeply. So, a slightly higher score at 3.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: I don't feel any urgency or strong reason to buy it based on the ad alone. A 2 reflects that lack of motivation.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without a compelling reason or personal need, trying it isn't something I'm inclined towards. Another 2.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: There's a tiny bit of consideration because the idea is somewhat appealing, but it's very low on my priority list. A 3 seems appropriate.
