Alright, I need to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's break it down step by step.

First, their demographic profile: they're a Chinese male in his 30s-39s, with a high school education, working as an office worker, divorced, and earns between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, but not extremely high. Their personality traits show they are somewhat reserved, disagreeable in terms of being helpful or trusting, sometimes rude, thorough in their work, but not very good at making plans, tends to be careless neutrally, gets nervous and worries a lot, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination, is original, and doesn't have few artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is reserved and sometimes rude. They might not be very influenced by ads that are too energetic or pushy. Since they're also a bit disagreeable, they might find the ad too upbeat and not aligning with their personality. So maybe around 3.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad mentions staying energized and looking good. Given his income level and being in an office job, he might be interested in products that offer convenience or benefits like energy boost. However, his tendency to worry and get nervous might make him skeptical of such claims. So maybe a 4.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - The person is thorough but also sometimes careless. He might question if the drink actually works as advertised. His skeptical nature could lower his belief in the ad's effectiveness. Maybe a 3.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Since he's reserved and not outgoing, maybe the ad's energy doesn't appeal to him much. However, looking good is a personal benefit that might attract him. So perhaps a 4.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - He is thorough but his income allows for higher spending, but he worries a lot and is emotionally unstable. Maybe the ad's promise is too good to be true for him. So maybe a 3.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Even if he doesn't intend to purchase immediately, he might consider it after more thought. So perhaps a 4.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Given his careful side, he's likely to think about it before deciding. Maybe a 5.

Putting it all together, the scores would reflect a neutral to slightly negative attitude towards the ad and cautious consideration for purchase.
