Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which are positive traits. However, considering my personality, I'm reserved and sometimes careless. While the message is appealing, it doesn't strongly resonate with me because I don't prioritize such products highly. So, a 3.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The claims of energy and looking good might appeal to someone outgoing, but since I lean more towards being reserved, I'm not as drawn in. It's somewhat interesting but doesn't capture my attention fully. A 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The message is clear and positive, which aligns with my trusting nature. However, I'm also careful (sometimes careless), so I might question if these benefits are realistic. Thus, a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Visually, ads can be attractive, but without seeing it, I rely on the text. The wording is positive, which matches my trusting side, but again, not compelling enough for a high score. A 5.

Moving to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: My monthly income is decent, but I'm more reserved and don't feel an urgent need for such products. Plus, I tend to be careless about buying things that aren't essential. So, a 3.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: While the benefits are tempting, my cautious nature makes me think twice. Without a strong emotional drive, trying it isn't a top priority. A 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: The ad does present appealing points, and considering my income allows for such purchases, I might give it some thought. However, other factors like habit or necessity would play a bigger role. So, a 5.
