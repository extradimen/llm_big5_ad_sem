Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

First, the advertisement states that without this drink, you might feel tired and look dull. Considering my personality traits, I'm reserved and sometimes rude, which might make me more introspective about social interactions. However, being a civil servant with a high income in Vietnam, I value appearing professional, so looking dull could be a concern.

The ad is trying to appeal to my desire to maintain energy levels and present well. Since I strongly agree that I have an active imagination and am original, the ad's message might resonate if it's presented creatively. However, the emotional stability score is low, so stress or anxiety about appearances might affect how I perceive the ad.

For attitude toward the advertisement:
1. Like: The message could be useful, but I'm not sure if the ad is particularly engaging.
2. Interesting: It touches on fatigue and appearance, which are relevant, but I don't find it very compelling.
3. Good: While it has a good premise, the execution might lack depth or clarity.
4. Attractive: The visual or emotional appeal isn't strong enough for me.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Since the ad highlights potential benefits, there's some interest but not enough to drive an immediate purchase.
2. Try to buy: Maybe if I see it multiple times or have a reason to seek such products.
3. Consider buying: It's on my radar, but other factors like price and convenience will influence the decision.

Overall, the ad has potential but doesn't strongly connect with me due to my reserved nature and focus on professional image rather than social interactions.
