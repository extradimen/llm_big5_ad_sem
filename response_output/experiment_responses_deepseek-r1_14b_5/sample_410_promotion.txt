Okay, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given that I'm in my mid-40s and a blue-collar worker, health and energy are important to me. But the phrasing feels too generic and not tailored to someone like me. So, maybe 3.
2. **Interesting**: The message is clear but lacks specifics. It doesn't mention anything about long-term benefits or how it's different from other drinks. That makes it less interesting—so 4.
3. **Good**: While the ad aims for positivity, without any concrete evidence or unique selling points, I'm not convinced it's good enough to stand out. So, 5.
4. **Attractive**: The visuals and message could be appealing, but since I don't feel connected personally, I'd rate it a 6.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend**: Even though the ad resonates on some level with health benefits, without trust or specific details, my intent to buy is low—so 4.
2. **Try**: The idea of trying isn't bad, but without more info, I'm hesitant. Maybe a 5.
3. **Consider**: Considering buying is better than not, but again, lacking strong reasons brings it down to 6.

Overall, the ad doesn't hit all the right notes for me as a potential buyer with my background and traits.
