Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement. Let's break it down.

First, let me recap her profile. She's a Chinese woman over 60, single, with a high school education, working as an office worker, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits: she's talkative and outgoing (strongly agrees), not reserved at all. However, she's disagreeable in being helpful and unselfish, trusting, sometimes rude, neutral on originality, has few artistic interests but a strong imagination. She does thorough jobs, makes plans, isn't careless, doesn't get nervous much but worries a lot, is emotionally stable, and has an active imagination.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day."

Attitude toward the advertisement:

1. I like the ad.
2. I think the ad is interesting.
3. I believe the ad is good.
4. I find the ad attractive.

Purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
2. I will try to buy this product.
3. I will consider buying this product.

So, let's analyze each point.

Starting with attitude toward the ad. She's talkative and outgoing, so maybe she likes ads that are engaging. The ad is about a drink that keeps you energized and looking good. For someone over 60, staying energized might be appealing if they're still working or active. Looking good could mean feeling better about themselves.

But considering her personality: she's not really helpful or trusting, so maybe the ad seems too optimistic or doesn't align with her more cautious nature. She worries a lot, which might make her skeptical of health claims unless supported well. However, the ad is positive and probably uses imagery that's appealing—maybe vibrant colors, people looking energetic.

She has an active imagination but isn't particularly original. So, she can imagine the benefits but might not be swayed by creative overstatements. Since she does thorough jobs and makes plans, she might appreciate ads that present clear benefits without too much fluff.

But given her age and income level, perhaps she's more price-sensitive? Or maybe she values health products, especially if they help with energy levels, which could be a concern for someone in their senior years.

On the other hand, she is emotionally stable but worries a lot. So, the ad might not push too many emotional buttons, but it does focus on positive outcomes—looking good and staying energized—which aligns with her desire to feel good about herself.

Now, looking at each attitude question:

1. I like the ad. Since she's outgoing, maybe she likes something that's upbeat and positive. So perhaps a 5 or 6? But if she's more cautious, maybe lower.

2. I think the ad is interesting. Given her active imagination, it might be seen as interesting, so maybe 4-6.

3. I believe the ad is good. Trust issues here; she strongly disagrees with being trusting. So maybe lower score, like 3 or 4.

4. I find the ad attractive. If the visuals are appealing, maybe 5 or higher. But if it's too flashy, perhaps not.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She might be more practical; unless she's convinced, probably a low score, like 2-3.

2. Will try to buy: Maybe she's willing to consider it but not immediately, so maybe 3 or 4.

3. Consider buying: Possibly higher, as the product seems relevant if it helps with energy and appearance, which might be important for her.

But wait, she has a high school education, so perhaps ads that are too complex would lose her. The ad is simple, which might appeal to her more. Also, given her income level, maybe price is a factor—if the drink isn't affordable, it won't resonate. But since the ad doesn't mention price, it's hard to say.

She works in an office, so staying energized could be relevant during long work hours. The product might be positioned as something that helps professionals stay focused and look good, which could align with her job.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude: She might not strongly like it but find it somewhat interesting and believe it's okay. Maybe 3 for like, 4 for interesting, 3 for good, and 4 for attractive.

Purchase intention: Not sure she intends to buy right away, but she might consider it if others recommend or if she tries it. So perhaps lower scores for intend and try, higher for consider.

Wait, let me think again. She's talkative and outgoing—maybe she appreciates the ad because it's positive and could be something she shares with friends. The benefits are clear: energy and looking good. Since she is worried a lot, maybe she's concerned about health but not sure if this drink will help.

So, she might find it somewhat likeable, interesting, but not entirely trustworthy. For purchase intent, since the ad makes claims that could be beneficial to her, she might consider it more than others, so higher consideration score.

Maybe:

Ad attitude: 3,4,3,5

Purchase intention: 2,3,6

But I'm not sure about the exact numbers yet.
