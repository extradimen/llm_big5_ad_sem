Okay, so I need to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

My demographics are: over 60, from China, female, high school education, student, divorced, monthly income over 46 million VND. My personality traits include being reserved, helpful, not trusting, not rude, thorough, planful, sometimes careless, not easily nervous but worry a lot and am emotionally stable.

So, starting with the ad itself. The key points are energy and looking good every day. Since I'm over 60, maybe I'm more concerned about health and appearance as I age. But wait, being reserved, I might not be very outgoing or into social trends that prioritize looking young. However, looking your best could be important for confidence.

The drink's benefits are staying energized and looking good. Given my age, energy might be a concern, but maybe traditional methods or foods are preferred over such drinks. Also, as someone who is careful (I do thorough jobs, make plans), I might check the ingredients and effectiveness.

Personality-wise, being helpful and unselfish could mean that if the ad emphasizes community or shared benefits, it might resonate. But if it's too focused on individual appearance, maybe not so much. Trust issues might make me skeptical of quick fixes.

Looking at the questions:

1. I like the ad.
   - Since I'm reserved and not very outgoing, an ad that's energetic and about looking good might not align with my preferences. I might find it superficial or irrelevant. So probably a low score here.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Interesting could mean it captures attention. But if the message seems too generic or focuses on youth, which might not be as relevant to me, maybe neutral. Or perhaps not very interested.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Believing requires trust and seeing value. Since I'm somewhat trusting but also cautious, and considering my age, maybe it's not something I would fully believe without more evidence.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness might relate to visual appeal or emotional connection. If the ad is visually appealing and makes me feel positive about myself, it could score higher. But if it feels too flashy or unrelated, maybe lower.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase.
   - Even if the ad resonates a bit, intending to buy might be low because of skepticism, cost (high income but perhaps looking for value), and preference for traditional products.

2. Will try to buy.
   - Maybe neutral or low; trying something new might not be the first choice given my cautious nature.

3. Consider buying.
   - Considering could be possible if there's some interest in improving energy, but it's probably not a top priority, so maybe neutral.

So putting numbers:

Ad attitude scores: [1 (don't like), 2 (not interesting), 3 (slightly believe), 4 (maybe attractive)]
Purchase intention: [1 (no intent), 2 (won't try), 3 (might consider)]

But I need to map these into the scale from 1-7. So maybe:

I don't like it much, so 2 for like.
Interesting? Maybe 3.
Believe it's good? 4.
Attractive? 5.

Purchase intention: Intend - 3, try - 3, consider - 4.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.

If I'm reserved and not very trusting, maybe the ad isn't particularly appealing to me. So:

1. Like: 2
2. Interesting: 3
3. Good: 4 (maybe)
4. Attractive: 5

Purchase intention:
- Intend: 3
- Try: 3
- Consider: 4

But perhaps considering the drink's benefits, I might be more inclined to think about it, so maybe higher on some scores.

Alternatively, given that I'm over 60 and looking for health benefits, but not necessarily focused on appearance, maybe the ad doesn't hit the mark. So lower scores.

Wait, in my personality, I worry a lot but am emotionally stable. Maybe the ad's promise of energy and looking good could appeal to someone worried about aging, so perhaps higher than expected.

Alternatively, being reserved might make me less interested in ads that are too pushy or focus on social image.

I think I'll settle on:

Ad attitude: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Purchase intention: [3, 4, 4]

But maybe not. Let's adjust based on each point.

For ad态度:
1. Like: 3
2. Interesting: 4
3. Good: 5
4. Attractive: 6

Wait, no. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Given the traits, especially being reserved and not trusting, but valuing looking good, perhaps:

Ad态度 scores: [3, 4, 5, 5]
Purchase intention: [4, 5, 5]

But considering cost and trust issues, maybe lower.

Alternatively, given that I'm over 60 with a high income, maybe the product is seen as something of quality, so higher purchase intent. But still, being cautious.

I think the best way is to give low scores for ad态度 (since it's not very aligned with my values) and moderate for purchase intention.
