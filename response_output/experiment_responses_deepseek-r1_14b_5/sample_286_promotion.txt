Alright, so I'm evaluating this advertisement for a drink that's supposed to help you stay energized and look your best every day. Let me break down my thoughts based on the demographic and personality traits provided.

First, considering my age is over 60, living in China, and having a monthly income between 36 million to 45 million VND, I'm probably someone who's more traditional but also has the means to buy better quality products. However, I might be more cautious about health-related products, as older individuals are often more skeptical of new or unproven items.

Looking at my personality traits: I'm talkative but not outgoing or sociable. That makes me less likely to be influenced by ads that emphasize socializing or fitting in with a crowd. Being reserved means I might prefer more subtle or personal benefits from products rather than something meant for show. 

I tend to disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean I'm not as concerned about the product's impact on others. However, since I'm a student living with parents, maybe there's some consideration towards how this drink could benefit family members or be used during study times.

Emotionally, I get nervous easily but don't worry a lot, so stress-relief aspects might not be a primary concern unless the ad directly addresses anxiety or fatigue. I'm not emotionally stable and have an active imagination but am neutral on originality. This might mean I'm more open to creative ideas but not necessarily looking for something groundbreaking.

Evaluating the ad's message: It focuses on energy and looking good, which could appeal if it's positioned as a health supplement. However, given my personality traits, I'm skeptical (strongly disagree on trusting) so credibility is key. The ad doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence, making it less persuasive.

Purchase intention: As someone who makes plans and follows through (Agree), I might be more organized in purchasing decisions but without trust in the product's claims, the intent to buy is low.

So, the ad isn't resonating because it lacks concrete information and doesn't align with my personality traits that value trust and practicality. The benefits are vague, so it's hard to see the value.
