Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." My job is to assess how much I like the ad (attitude toward it) and my intention to purchase the product based on the given traits.

Starting with my demographics: I'm from China, over 60 years old, have a postgraduate degree, but am a blue-collar worker. Single, making between 16 million to 25 million VND monthly. That's a decent income in Vietnam, though maybe not extremely high for someone with a postgrad degree.

Personality-wise, I'm reserved (Agree), helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), but generally not trusting (Disagree). I don't tend to be talkative or outgoing, so ads that appeal to socializing might not hit me as much. However, being helpful and strong-willed could make me more interested in products that offer benefits.

Looking at the ad's message: It targets energy and looking good. For someone over 60, staying energized is a big plus. But I also need to consider how this product would fit into my lifestyle. As a blue-collar worker, maybe I'm active and could use something to keep me going throughout the day.

The advertisement seems straightforward but perhaps not tailored specifically for an older demographic. It might appeal more to younger people who are focused on looking their best in a more social context. But since it's about energy, which is relevant at any age, that part is good.

Now, evaluating each attitude score:

1. I like the ad: The message is positive, but as someone reserved and not very outgoing, I might not feel strongly connected to it. It doesn't emphasize community or social aspects, so maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-7.

2. Interesting: The idea of staying energized is interesting, especially for someone active. But the "look your best" part might not resonate as much with me personally. Maybe a 5.

3. Good: It's a clear and positive message, but without specific details or proof, I'm not sure how credible it feels. Perhaps a 4.

4. Attractive: The phrasing is catchy, but maybe not enough to make me find it very attractive. A 5 seems fair.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: Given that I'm cautious (Disagree on trusting), I might not immediately intend to buy without more evidence or personal experience. Maybe a 3.

2. Try the product: If I found some value, I might be willing to try it once, so a 4.

3. Consider buying: It's on my radar after trying, so considering is possible, but not certain. A 5 seems reasonable.
