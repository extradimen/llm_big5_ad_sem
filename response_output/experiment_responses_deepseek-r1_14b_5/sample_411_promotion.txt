Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:
1. **I like the ad.**: The ad is pretty generic and doesn't resonate with me personally. It doesn't highlight anything specific that would make me connect or feel a liking towards it.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: There's nothing particularly engaging about the message. It's too vague and doesn't stand out to capture my interest.
3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The content lacks depth, making it hard for me to see value or trust in the claims made.
4. **I find the ad attractive.**: Visually, if the ad is well-made, it might attract attention, but based on the text alone, there's nothing that stands out as attractive.

Moving on to purchase intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: With a high school education and limited income, I'm more cautious about spending on such products unless they have proven benefits tailored to my needs.
2. **I will try to buy this product.**: The ad doesn't provide enough compelling reasons or evidence for me to feel motivated to try the product.
3. **I will consider buying this product.**: There's minimal information, so I'm not inclined to give it serious consideration without more convincing details.

Overall, the ad lacks personal relevance and specific benefits that would influence my decision-making process as a consumer with my background.
