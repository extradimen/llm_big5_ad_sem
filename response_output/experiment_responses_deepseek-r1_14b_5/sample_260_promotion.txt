Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores for the advertisement and my purchase intentions.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best, which seems positive. However, given that I'm reserved and don't find myself strongly agreeing with being talkative or outgoing, the message might not resonate personally. It doesn't directly address my personality traits, so my liking is neutral.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The benefits mentioned are clearâ€”energy and appearance. Since I value looking good and staying energetic, this could be appealing. However, without more personal relevance to my reserved nature, it's a 3 on interest.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: The ad makes positive claims, but they're quite generic. Without specific details or a connection to my values, I'm neutral on whether it's a good advertisement.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The visual appeal and message are okay, but without knowing more about the product or seeing an emotional connection, my attraction is moderate.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: The claims are tempting, especially looking best every day. However, considering I'm not very outgoing and the ad doesn't speak directly to that aspect, my intent is low.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: Without more evidence or personal relevance, trying it isn't a strong consideration.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's on the edge; I might think about it if I were in the market for such products, but not enough to act on immediately.
