Alright, let me go through this step by step. So I need to evaluate the advertisement based on my demographic profile and personality traits. The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, understanding who I am in this scenario: I'm a female from China, under 20 with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant, divorced, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being outgoing but also reserved, helpful, trusting yet sometimes rude, thorough, good at planning, prone to nervousness, a worrier, emotionally unstable, imaginative, original, and with strong artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad's message: It's targeting someone who wants to feel energized and look good. Since I'm a civil servant, maybe that means I have a busy schedule which could require energy drinks. However, my monthly income is less than 15 million VND, so I might be price-sensitive. But I'm also under 20, possibly still student or just starting my career, but with a postgraduate degree, so maybe more aware of health products.

Personality-wise: Being outgoing and sociable, the ad's focus on looking your best could appeal to me because I like social interactions. However, being reserved might make me not as concerned about appearances? Or maybe it's balanced since I'm both outgoing and reserved. Also, being helpful and unselfish suggests I care about how I present myself to others.

I tend to be trusting, which is good for ads, but I also sometimes rude, which isn't directly related but might affect my perception if the ad seems too pushy. I do thorough jobs and make plans, so maybe I would read more about the product or check reviews before buying. However, I get nervous easily and worry a lot, which could make me cautious about health products. Plus, I'm emotionally unstable, so maybe ads that play on emotions might not resonate well.

The ad is positive, focusing on benefits: energy and looking good. That's appealing because it covers both physical and social aspects. But I also worry about the credibility of such claims. Does this drink really work? How does it compare to others?

Looking at my scores for ad attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The message is positive, but since I'm critical, maybe not strongly. Maybe 3.
2. Is it interesting? It's a common claim, so not very interesting. Maybe 4.
3. Is it good? It's well-made, but the claims might be generic. Maybe 5.
4. Attractive? The visuals matter, but if it's just text, maybe not. If there are images of energetic people, then maybe higher, like 6.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: I'm cautious about health products, so probably a 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 4 because I might look into it more.
3. Consider buying: Possibly higher, like 5, as it's something that could be useful but I need to think.

I have to make sure these scores fit the scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). So maybe adjust them accordingly.
