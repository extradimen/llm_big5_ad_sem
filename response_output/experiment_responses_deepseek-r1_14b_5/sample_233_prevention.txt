Alright, I need to evaluate how this virtual person would respond to the advertisement. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message seems to focus on preventing tiredness and maintaining a good appearance.

The person's demographic is a married Chinese man in his 50s with a postgraduate degree but working as a blue-collar worker. His monthly income is under 15 million VND, which is about $675 USD. He's reserved, helpful, trusting, sometimes rude, not thorough, disorganized, emotionally stable, and has an active imagination but isn't original.

Starting with ad attitude:

1. I like the ad: The ad targets feelings of tiredness and looking bad. Given his age and occupation (blue-collar), he might be concerned about energy levels and appearances. However, being reserved, maybe not too excited. So a 4?
2. Interesting: It's a common message but may resonate if he relates to feeling tired. Maybe a 5.
3. Good: The ad is clear but might feel generic. Perhaps a 4.
4. Attractive: The imagery could be appealing, but his reserved nature might not find it overly attractive. So another 4.

Purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: He's practical but might not see immediate need. Maybe a 3.
2. Try the product: Slightly more inclination after considering, maybe a 4.
3. Consider buying: Given the ad's message, he might think about it, so a 5.

I'm thinking of scores around 4s for attitude and mid-4s to low 5s for purchase intent.
