Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." The target audience here is someone looking for energy and possibly beauty benefits. Now, considering the demographic: she's over 60, from China, has a bachelorâ€™s degree, is divorced, earns less than 15 million VND monthly.

Her personality traits are important too. She's talkative but reserved, sometimes rude, thorough in her work, gets nervous easily, worries a lot, isn't emotionally stable, has an active imagination, and doesn't feel helpful or unselfish. That's quite a mix.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - Does she like ads? She's talkative but reserved. Maybe not very into energetic products, considering her age. Not sure, maybe neutral.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - Interesting could relate to the active imagination trait. The idea of looking your best might appeal if she values appearance. Maybe a 5.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - believability: She's trusting (strongly agrees), but also thorough and sometimes careless. Since it's about health, maybe she needs evidence. So neutral.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on how much it resonates. For someone over 60, maybe not as appealing if it's targeting a younger crowd. Maybe low, like 3.

For purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intending: She's not very trusting of ads, but she does worry a lot and might seek products for energy. Maybe neutral.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it: Might be cautious but could be open if the ad seems trustworthy. Neutral again.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering: She's thorough, so she might think about it before deciding. Higher than intend and try, maybe a 5.

Putting it all together, I'm guessing the scores would be low to neutral for attitude but slightly higher consideration for purchase intention.
