Alright, let me break this down. I'm a female civil servant from China, under 20 with a postgraduate degree and a monthly income between 16 to 25 million VND. My personality traits include being talkative but not very helpful or trusting, sometimes careless, and having an active imagination.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, I think about whether this ad would appeal to me. Since I'm outgoing and talkative, maybe I care about my appearance and energy levels. The idea that without the drink, I might look dull could resonate if I value looking good and being energetic in social settings.

But wait, the ad is pretty generic. It doesn't specify what the drink does exactly beyond preventing tiredness and dull looks. I'm not sure how effective it is or if there are better alternatives. My tendency to be careless might mean I don't prioritize this over other products I know and trust.

For purchase intention: The ad makes me think about the benefits, but without more details, I'm skeptical. Plus, my income level allows me to spend on various things, but I prefer to buy what I believe is effective and reliable. Since there's no strong evidence or specific benefits mentioned in the ad, I'm not convinced enough to try it immediately.

So, for attitude toward the advertisement: It's somewhat interesting because of the potential benefits, but not compelling enough to make me like it strongly. The ad is okay but doesn't stand out as good or attractive to me.

For purchase intention: I might consider buying if someone recommends it, but on my own, I don't feel a strong intent. Trying it is possible, but considering it is more likely without further information.
