Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores step by step.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude towards myself:

1. **I like the ad (score 3):** The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best. As a civil servant in China, I might appreciate energy-boosting products, but it doesn't cater specifically to my needs. It feels generic, so I don't have a strong positive or negative feeling towards it.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score 3):** The message is clear about benefits, but it's not particularly engaging. There's no unique angle or emotional appeal that stands out to me.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score 4):** It does a thorough job of presenting the product's benefits without any misleading information, which aligns with my trait of being detail-oriented. However, it's not compelling enough to make me strongly believe in its effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score 3):** The visuals and message are okay, but there's nothing exceptional about them that would draw me in more than a passing glance.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product (score 2):** While staying energized is a benefit, I don't feel enough connection or urgency from the ad. My cautious nature makes me wait for more information before deciding.

2. **I will try to buy this product (score 3):** There's some interest because it offers benefits I might value, but without further persuasion or personal need, I'm not compelled to act immediately.

3. **I will consider buying this product (score 5):** The ad makes me think about the product as a potential option, especially since it aligns with my desire for efficiency and thoroughness in products I use.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate deeply enough to drive an immediate purchase but introduces me to the product as something worth considering later.
