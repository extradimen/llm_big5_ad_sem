Alright, I need to figure out how this person would score their ad. Let me start by understanding the user's background and personality.

He's a Chinese male in his late 30s, with a high school education, works in an office, is divorced, and earns between 16-25 million VND per month. That's a decent income but not extremely high. His personality traits show he's not very talkative or outgoing—strongly disagree on those. He's somewhat reserved, which might make him more introspective.

He disagrees with being helpful and unselfish, which suggests he might be more self-focused. Trust issues are present since he strongly disagrees with being trusting. He tends to be rude, so maybe the ad needs to be clear without being too pushy.

He does thorough work but isn't great at making plans, possibly indicating he's detail-oriented but not very organized. He sometimes feels careless and gets nervous easily, which could mean he prefers products that offer stability or efficiency. Worrying a lot and lacking emotional stability might make him responsive to ads that promise relief from stress.

He has an active imagination and is original, so creative aspects in the ad could appeal to him. However, his lack of artistic interests might make him prefer practicality over aesthetics.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It's targeting fatigue and appearance concerns, which are relevant for someone who values looking good and feeling well-rested, especially in an office job where appearances matter.

Considering his personality, he might be critical of ads that seem too manipulative. The ad seems to play on fears of appearing tired, which could resonate if he's concerned about his image at work. However, the straightforward message might not be engaging enough for someone who values originality and creativity.

For attitude toward the advertisement: He might find it somewhat interesting because it addresses real concerns but doesn't feel particularly good or attractive due to its directness. His scores would likely be neutral to slightly negative on these aspects.

Regarding purchase intention, he's cautious (worry a lot) but thorough in his work, so if the product genuinely helps, he might consider buying it. He isn't sure yet, so his intentions would be moderate—maybe considering but not immediately intending to buy.
