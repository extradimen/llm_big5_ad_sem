Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude: The advertisement mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, especially being strongly agreeable to worrying a lot, I might resonate with the idea of looking good as a way to boost confidence amidst stress. However, the message feels somewhat generic, so while it's not dislike (hence 3 for like), it doesn't excite me much. Interesting? Maybe a bit at 3 because it's common but not unique. The overall goodness is neutral—2. Attractiveness might be low since I'm not particularly drawn to such ads, hence another 2.

For purchase intention: I'm more analytical and tend to agree with thoroughness but don't trust easily, so the ad's claims feel too vague. Intend? Probably a 3 because it's neutral. Trying it? Neutral as well—maybe 3. Considering buying? A bit higher at 4 because while not convinced, I might think about it if others recommend or if circumstances change.
