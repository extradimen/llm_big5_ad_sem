Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude towards it:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, especially being a student with a busy schedule, this seems relevant. However, the phrasing is quite generic, so I'm not overly excited about it. So, a 4 on a scale of 1-7.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but lacks any unique angle or creativity. Since I value originality and have an active imagination, the ad doesn't stand out to me. A 3 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: It's functional in conveying its benefits, but it doesn't provide enough detail or emotional appeal. My score remains a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual aspects aren't specified, so I'm assuming it's standard. Without strong imagery or emotional hooks, I don't find it particularly attractive. A 2 here.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: While the benefits are appealing, there's no compelling reason for me to choose this over other options. My score is a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some interest, but without more information or a strong emotional connection, I'm not motivated enough to seek it out. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It does make me think about the product as an option, especially since staying energized is important for my studies. So, a 5 here.
