Okay, so I need to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down their profile and personality traits first.

They're a male from China, between 20-29 years old, with a postgraduate education and currently a student. Their monthly income is quite high—between 36 million and 45 million VND. That's pretty substantial for a student, so they might have some disposable income to spend on luxury items or lifestyle products.

Looking at their personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Agree. They enjoy engaging in conversations.
- Outgoing/Sociable: Strongly Disagree. They prefer keeping to themselves more.
- Reserved: Strongly Agree. They are introspective and not one to seek the spotlight.
- Helpful/Unselfish: Agree. They do care about others but might not be overly so.
- Trusting: Disagree. They might be cautious or skeptical of others' intentions.
- Rude: Strongly Disagree. They value politeness.
- Thorough Job: Neutral. Not particularly known for being meticulous, but not careless either.
- Plans and Follows Through: Agree. They are goal-oriented and responsible.
- Careless: Strongly Disagree. They take their tasks seriously.
- Nervous Easily: Strongly Disagree. They have a calm demeanor.
- Worry a Lot: Strongly Agree. They might be anxious or have high stress levels.
- Emotionally Stable: Strongly Agree. Wait, that's conflicting with worrying a lot but being stable? Maybe they manage their emotions well despite feeling worried.
- Active Imagination: Agree. Creative thinking is something they engage in.
- Original/New Ideas: Disagree. They might not be the most innovative or prefer sticking to tried and true methods.
- Artistic Interests: Neutral. They don't have a strong leaning towards arts but aren't opposed either.

Now, the advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who want to avoid feeling fatigued and maintain their appearance to stay lively and presentable.

Given that they're reserved and talkative but not outgoing, maybe they prefer products that enhance their personal well-being without necessarily needing social validation. They might be more into self-care or personal efficiency.

They worry a lot but are emotionally stable—maybe they're looking for ways to manage stress and maintain energy levels. The drink's promise of preventing tiredness could appeal to someone who is juggling studies, maybe part-time work, and other responsibilities, needing to stay sharp.

Their income suggests they might be willing to spend on premium products if it offers real benefits. However, their cautious nature (disagree with trusting others) might make them skeptical of the ad's claims. They would probably want evidence or some reassurance before trying it.

They are also original and have an active imagination, which could mean they're open to new ideas but not necessarily looking for something too flashy or out there. The ad is straightforward, focusing on functionality rather than style.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: Since they like talking but aren't outgoing, maybe the message feels a bit direct. They might find it interesting if it addresses their personal needs but could be turned off if it's too pushy or lacks depth.

For purchase intention: If the ad makes them believe it can help with their energy levels and appearance, they might consider trying it. But since they tend to plan and follow through (agree), they might only do so after careful consideration. Their strong disagreement with being careless suggests they won't make a hasty decision.

So overall, their personality traits would lead them to be somewhat cautious but open if the ad's message aligns well with their personal needs for energy and social presentation.

The individual, given his reserved nature and high income, might find the advertisement interesting if it addresses his need for energy and social presentation. However, his skepticism could make him cautious about the claims. His personality traits suggest he is more likely to consider purchasing the product after careful consideration rather than acting impulsively.
