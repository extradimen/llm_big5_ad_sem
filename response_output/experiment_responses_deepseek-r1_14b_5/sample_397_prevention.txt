Alright, I need to evaluate how this advertisement would be received by a person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

Let's start by breaking down the user's profile. She's over 60, from China, has a bachelor’s degree, is a managerial employee, divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality traits include being outgoing, helpful, trusting, worried a lot, and having an active imagination.

The ad seems to target feelings of tiredness and looking dull without the drink. For someone who's worried a lot (score 7), this could resonate because she might be concerned about her appearance and energy levels, especially in a managerial role where looking presentable is important. However, she doesn't agree with having an active imagination or being original, so the ad's message might not appeal to her creatively.

She's outgoing and helpful, which makes her value social interactions. The ad's focus on tiredness and dull looks could make her think about how others perceive her, especially in professional settings. This could make the ad more relevant because she values others' opinions and being seen positively.

On the other hand, she doesn't strongly agree with making plans or following through (score 1), so she might not be someone who's proactive in trying new products unless she feels a strong need. Her monthly income is below 15 million VND, which is about $600, so she might be price-sensitive. The ad doesn’t mention cost, but she might worry about the value for money.

Considering her personality, she tends to worry a lot and is emotionally unstable (disagree), so the ad's message could play into her anxieties about looking tired or dull, making her more susceptible to the fear of negative judgment. Her strong agreement with being helpful and unselfish suggests she might care about how others feel, but the ad doesn't position itself as a solution for others' benefit.

In terms of attitude toward the ad, since it addresses concerns that align with her personality (worrying about appearance and social acceptance), she might find it interesting and good. However, her neutrality on being talkative and original might make the ad less appealing in terms of attracting her emotionally beyond just the message's content.

For purchase intention, while the fear appeal might push her to consider the product, her lower score on intending to purchase suggests she might not be immediately convinced without more evidence or a compelling reason. She could be considering it but hasn't made up her mind yet.
