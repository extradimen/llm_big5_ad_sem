Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions based on their demographic profile and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the person: They're a Chinese male in his 20s or early 30s, with a high school education, working as a blue-collar worker, living with parents, earning between 26 to 35 million VND per month. Personality-wise, they're reserved, not very outgoing, talkative is a strong disagree, and so on.

The ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance benefits.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is reserved and not very outgoing or talkative. Maybe they don't connect with ads that are too bubbly or social. But the ad is about personal energy and looking good, which might appeal to someone wanting to improve their personal image or efficiency. Not sure if it's likable based on personality; maybe neutral.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - They have an active imagination and original ideas. So something that's a bit catchy or unique could be interesting. The ad seems straightforward, so maybe not super interesting.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Trust is an issue here; they strongly disagree with being generally trusting. So if the ad makes claims without evidence, it might not be believable. They're also thorough in their work but disagree on that trait, perhaps meaning they don't think the ad's message is solid.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Being reserved and not outgoing, maybe not drawn to something too flashy or attention-seeking. But looking good could have personal appeal.

Purchase intentions:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Their monthly income is decent, but they're a blue-collar worker, so might be budget-conscious. They don't worry much (strongly disagree on worrying), so maybe not in a hurry to spend. Intend? Maybe low.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - If they are considering health and appearance, they might be open to trying it, but given their reserved nature, perhaps not proactive.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - They make plans and follow through (Agree), so if the ad makes them think about the benefits, they might consider it, but on a lower scale than someone more outgoing or trusting.

I think each of these scores would be low to moderate based on their personality traits, especially around trust and being reserved. So maybe 2s or 3s for attitude towards the ad and similarly for purchase intentions.
