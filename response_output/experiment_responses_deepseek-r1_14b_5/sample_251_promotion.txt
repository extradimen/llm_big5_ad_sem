Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would respond to the ad. Let's break it down step by step.

First, her background: She's from China, over 60, has a high school education, works in an office, is divorced, and earns between 36 million to 45 million VND monthly. That's about $1,478 to $1,847 USD, which isn't extremely high but decent for Vietnam. Her personality traits show she's helpful and unselfish, emotionally stable, has an active imagination, and is original with new ideas. However, she's neutral on being talkative and outgoing, strongly disagrees with being reserved, sometimes rude, doesn't do thorough jobs, and makes plans but isn't consistent.

Now, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it targets energy and appearance, which are common concerns for many people, especially in busy office environments.

Thinking about her personality, she's helpful and unselfish. Maybe she'd care about the benefits of the product for others, but not sure if that directly affects her purchase. She's emotionally stable and has an active imagination, so maybe she can see the value in such a drink. However, she sometimes finds herself rude, which might not make her too trusting of ads.

She doesn't do thorough jobs (disagree) and isn't always consistent with plans (neutral). So she might be a bit skeptical about trying new products without much research.

Her income is decent, so she can afford such a drink. Being an office worker, staying energized could be important for her job. Looking good every day might also matter socially or professionally.

But considering she's over 60 and perhaps more health-conscious, the ad needs to appeal to that demographic too. The phrasing seems aimed at younger professionals, which might not resonate as much with her.

She's original and imaginative but strongly agrees to having few artistic interests, so maybe she's more into practical benefits rather than aesthetics or creativity in ads.

In terms of attitude towards the ad: Does she like it? Maybe neutral because while the message is positive, it might not be tailored enough for her. Interesting? Neutral again; the message is clear but not particularly engaging for someone who values originality. Good? She might agree a bit more because staying energized and looking good are positive benefits. Attractive? Possibly neutral as well; the ad seems functional rather than visually appealing.

For purchase intention: Intend to purchase? Probably low, maybe 3 or 4, since she's not strongly motivated by the ad. Try to buy it? Maybe 4, if she's curious but not convinced. Consider buying? A bit higher, maybe 5, as she might think about it but isn't sure yet.

So overall, her scores would likely be in the middle on the ad attitude and lower on purchase intention.
