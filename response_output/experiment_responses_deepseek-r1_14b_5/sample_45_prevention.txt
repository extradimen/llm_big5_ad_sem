Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement based on the given demographic and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My task is to score my attitude toward the ad and my purchase intentions on a 7-point scale. I need to consider my own background as a Chinese female student under 20, earning between 36-45 million VND monthly while living with parents. Also, my personality traits are important here.

Looking at the personality traits:

- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing, sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Disagree
- Trusting: Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Neutral
- Thorough job: Agree
- Makes plans: Neutral
- Careless: Disagree
- Gets nervous easily: Disagree
- Worry a lot: Agree
- Emotionally stable: Strongly Disagree
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original, new ideas: Agree
- Few artistic interests: Disagree

So I'm outgoing and agreeable in social situations, which might make the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull more relatable. But being strongly disagree with helpfulness and unselfishness doesn't directly relate here. Worrying a lot could mean I'm concerned about appearing my best.

The advertisement seems to target people who care about their appearance and energy levels. It's using fear of negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull) without the product. Since I'm an outgoing person, this might appeal to me because I value how I present myself socially.

Regarding purchase intention: The ad focuses on preventing tiredness and dull looks, which are concerns for someone my age who is active and perhaps involved in social activities. However, I'm disagreeable towards being helpful and unselfish, but that's more about personal traits than purchasing decisions. My tendency to be thorough might make me look for more information before buying, but the ad doesn't provide specifics on how the drink works or its ingredients.

On a scale of 1-7, my attitude toward the ad would likely be positive because it resonates with my desire to feel good and present well. I think it's interesting (maybe a 5), good (probably around 6), and attractive (maybe a 4). For purchase intentions, I'm not sure yet but might consider buying (so scores of 3 each for intend and try, but higher for consider at 5).

Wait, but considering the ad is about prevention, it's more of a long-term solution. My personality shows I worry a lot, so maybe that plays into wanting to prevent tiredness and dull looks. However, without specific product details, my intention might not be very high.

I'm probably scoring the ad as somewhat positive but not extremely so, and my purchase intentions are low because I need more information or convincing evidence.
