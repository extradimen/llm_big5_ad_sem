Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.**: The ad's message is clear and directly addresses a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. Since I'm talkative and outgoing, I appreciate ads that are straightforward and relatable. So, I agree it's likableâ€”maybe a 5.

2. **I think the ad is interesting.**: The concept of linking fatigue to appearance is somewhat compelling, but it feels a bit generic. Not extremely interesting, so around a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good.**: It effectively communicates its message without being overly complex. However, I don't find it particularly inspiring or memorable, hence a 5.

4. **I find the ad attractive.**: The ad's visuals and message are decent, but not striking enough to make me strongly agree with 'attractive.' So, a 5 again.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.**: While I understand the benefits, I'm not convinced it's necessary for me. My monthly income is on the higher side in VND, but that doesn't mean I'll rush to buy this specific drink unless I have more reasons. So, a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product.**: There's some appeal, but without strong motivation or evidence, I'm not eager to try it immediately. A 4 seems fair.

3. **I will consider buying this product.**: It's something I might think about if someone recommends it or offers a discount, so maybe a 5 on the consideration scale.
