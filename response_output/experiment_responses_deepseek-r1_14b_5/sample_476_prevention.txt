Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement and provide scores based on my given demographic profile and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." My task is to assess how I, as a 50-59-year-old divorced office worker with a high school education and an income of 36-45 million VND per month, would react to this ad. Also, considering my personality traits which include being talkative, outgoing, helpful, trusting, but sometimes careless, not thorough, make plans but can be careless, very emotionally stable, have an active imagination, and original with ideas.

Starting with the first part: evaluating my attitude towards the ad. There are four questions here: like, interesting, good, attractive.

1. I like the ad.
   - The ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm an office worker, I might relate to feeling tired, especially if work is stressful. But the ad seems a bit generic. I don't know if it's appealing enough for me. Maybe neutral? So 4.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The message is straightforward but not very engaging. It doesn't stand out or make me think much. Maybe a 3 on this one, as it's somewhat interesting but not compelling.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - For an ad to be considered 'good,' it should effectively convey its message and maybe evoke some emotion. This one seems to do that by addressing tiredness and appearance, which are relevant. Maybe a 4 here.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - Attractiveness depends on how well it grabs attention. The wording is simple but doesn't have anything that would make me stop and look twice. So perhaps a 3.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intending to buy? Well, the ad makes me think about feeling tired, which is relatable. But without more information or persuasive elements, I'm not sure if I'd actually buy it. Maybe a 4, as there's some interest but not strong intent.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying it might be influenced by the ad, but since there's no specific call to action or offer, it's on the fence. Maybe a 3, leaning towards trying if it's available and affordable.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering is more likely because the ad does address a real need for me as someone who might feel tired at work. So maybe a 4 here.

Putting it all together:

Ad attitude scores: 4, 3, 4, 3

Purchase intention: 4, 3, 4
