Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement based on my demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break it down.

Starting with the attitude toward the ad:

1. Do I like the ad? Well, as a blue-collar worker in China, staying energized is important for work. Plus, looking good adds to confidence, which aligns with being outgoing. But I'm not sure if the ad addresses practical aspects like taste or price. The message is positive and relatable, so maybe I would like it. Maybe a 5?

2. Is the ad interesting? It highlights two benefitsâ€”energy and appearance. These are appealing to many people. However, the ad feels a bit generic. Without specific details, it might not capture much interest. So perhaps a 4.

3. Do I think the ad is good? The message is clear but lacks specifics about how the drink actually works or its ingredients. It doesn't provide enough information for me to be fully convinced. Maybe a 5 since it's positive but not detailed.

4. Is the ad attractive? The promise of energy and looking good could be visually appealing, but without seeing the actual ad creative, it's hard to say. The wording is straightforward, so maybe a 5 or 6. I'll go with 5.

Now for purchase intention:

1. Do I intend to buy this product? While the benefits are tempting, there's no evidence of the drink's effectiveness. Without trust in the brand or more info, I'm not convinced. So maybe a 4.

2. Will I try to buy it? If it's affordable and available, I might consider trying it once. But since my monthly income is limited, price could be a barrier. Maybe a 5 on the lower side.

3. Will I consider buying it? It depends on availability and reviews. If others recommend it, I might think about purchasing. So perhaps a 6 but leaning towards neutral. Maybe a 4 or 5. Let's say 5.
