Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this Chinese woman in her late 30s would respond to the advertisement. Let's break down the ad and then apply her personality traits.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting people who might be feeling fatigued or looking unattractive without the product. Since she's a blue-collar worker with a postgraduate degree, maybe she's juggling work and personal life, which could lead to fatigue.

Looking at her personality traits:
- She's talkative and outgoing but not reserved.
- Neutral about being helpful, so maybe not too concerned with others' opinions.
- Disagrees on trust, so if the ad is trustworthy? Hmm, not sure yet.
- Strongly disagrees with being rude, thorough, or careless. So she values doing things carefully and thoroughly, which might make her skeptical of quick fixes like a drink to stay alert.
- She's nervous easily but only agrees slightly, so moderate anxiety.
- Worry a lot: Disagrees, so maybe not overly concerned about looking dull.
- Emotionally stable? Strongly disagrees, so she might be more prone to mood swings or stress.
- Imagination is strong, original but disagrees with coming up with new ideas. Maybe she's creative but doesn't see herself as an innovator.

So the ad's message is about preventing tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Since she's a postgrad working blue-collar, maybe she has a busy schedule leading to fatigue. But since she values thoroughness and isn't trusting, she might question if this drink is the solution or just a quick fix.

Looking at her traits again:
- Talkative and outgoing: She likes social interactions but might not rely on a drink for energy to maintain that.
- Reserved? No, so she's more open, which might make her consider products that help her stay sociable.
- Helpfulness is neutral, so maybe the ad doesn't play into her desire to be helpful or unselfish.
- Trust issues: If the ad makes claims without evidence, she might not trust it.

So for the ad attitude:
1. Like: She's talkative and outgoing; if the drink helps her stay energetic, she might like the idea. But since she's careful, maybe 3/7?
2. Interesting: The message is about tiredness and appearance, which are relatable but not super compelling. Maybe 4.
3. Good: It has a clear message, but without evidence, it's neutral. So 5? Or maybe lower because of trust issues.
4. Attractive: If the ad is well-made, it could be attractive, so 6.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: She might not rush to buy unless convinced, maybe 3.
2. Try to buy: Maybe a 4, as she might consider it but not sure.
3. Consider buying: Definitely, so a 5 or higher, perhaps 6 if the ad resonates.

Overall, her cautious and careful nature makes her not fully trust the ad but still find it somewhat appealing. She's more likely to consider buying after thinking about it.
