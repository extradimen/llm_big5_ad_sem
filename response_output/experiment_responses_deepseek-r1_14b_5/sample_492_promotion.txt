Okay, I need to figure out how to score this advertisement based on my given demographic and personality traits. Let me start by understanding the ad itself: it says "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So, they're targeting people who want energy and appearance benefits daily.

Looking at my background, I'm a 20-29-year-old female from China with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker. I live with my parents and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I strongly agree with being helpful, trusting, not rude, thorough, planful, worried a lot, have an active imagination, original, and neutral about artistic interests. I disagree with being outgoing, reserved, careless, nervous, emotionally stable.

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** - The ad is positive but maybe a bit generic. It doesn't highlight anything unique or relatable enough for me. So, probably a 3.
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** - Not really, since it's a common claim in energy drinks. Maybe a 3 as well.
3. **I believe the ad is good.** - I'm skeptical because many ads make similar claims without evidence. A 4 might be fair.
4. **I find the ad attractive.** - It's visually appealing if well-made, but lacking depth. Maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** - No strong reason; maybe not necessary. So, 3.
2. **I will try to buy this product.** - Possibly during promotions, so a 4.
3. **I will consider buying this product.** - It's on my radar if recommended, so a 5.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with me, but I'm not entirely dismissive either.
