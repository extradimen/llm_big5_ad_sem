Alright, let me try to break down how I arrived at these scores. First, looking at the ad: it's a drink that claims without it, you might feel tired and look dull. 

Starting with attitude toward the advertisement:

1. **I like the ad**: The message is pretty straightforward, but I'm not sure if it appeals to me personally. It seems a bit generic and doesn't really connect with my interests or lifestyle. So maybe a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Well, it's trying to create a problem that this drink solves, which is a common tactic. But I don't find it particularly engaging or innovative. Maybe a 4.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The message is clear, but does it make me trust the product? Not really. It's just stating a possible consequence without evidence or specifics. So perhaps a 5 on believing it's effective.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visual and message might be appealing, but since I'm not in the target demographic (maybe more for older professionals), it doesn't hit home. Maybe around a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Since I don't feel any immediate need or strong connection, my intent is low. Maybe a 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without a compelling reason or personal benefit, the desire to try it isn't there. So perhaps a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's not something I would actively think about, but maybe if I saw it somewhere, I might give it a thought. That could be a 4.
