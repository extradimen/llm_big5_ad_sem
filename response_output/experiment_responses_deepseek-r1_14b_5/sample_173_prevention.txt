Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this virtual person with his specific demographics and personality traits would respond to the advertisement. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let's break down who he is. He's from China, male, over 60 years old, has a postgraduate degree, works in an office, single, and earns between 26 million to 35 million VND per month. His personality traits show he's talkative but not very outgoing, reserved, neutral about being helpful, distrustful of others, sometimes rude, not thorough, bad at following through on plans, careless, not nervous or worried, emotionally unstable, has an active imagination, original with ideas, and has few artistic interests.

So, when evaluating the ad, I need to consider his personality. He's reserved and emotionally unstable, which might make him cautious about products that promise to change how he feels. The ad is trying to sell a drink by creating fearâ€”without it, you'll feel tired and look dull. That could be effective if the person is concerned about their appearance or energy levels.

But looking at his traits, since he's not very trusting of others, he might question the credibility of the ad. Also, being emotionally unstable but not easily worried or nervous, maybe the fear aspect doesn't hit him hard enough to make him feel compelled to buy. His reserved nature might make him less likely to be swayed by emotional appeals.

In terms of purchase intention, his lack of thoroughness and tendency to be careless could mean he's not the type to rush into purchases based on ads alone. He might need more concrete evidence or recommendations before considering buying.

On a scale from 1 to 7:

For ad attitude:
1. Like: Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat interesting but doesn't connect deeply.
2. Interesting: Perhaps 4, as the message is clear but not captivating.
3. Good: A 3 again, since it's functional but lacks depth.
4. Attractive: Around 4, not particularly appealing.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend: Likely a low score, maybe 2, as he's not convinced yet.
2. Try to buy: Maybe 2, not motivated enough.
3. Consider buying: A 3, it's on his radar but not a priority.

Overall, the ad doesn't strongly resonate with him due to his personality traits, so his scores would reflect a neutral to slightly negative attitude and low purchase intentions.
