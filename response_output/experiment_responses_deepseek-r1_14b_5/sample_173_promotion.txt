Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the ad says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Let's start by understanding my own profile. I'm over 60, from China, single, earn between 26 million to 35 million VND a month, have a postgraduate degree, work in an office, and am male. My personality traits are talkative (Agree), outgoing (Neutral), reserved (Strongly Agree), helpful (Neutral), trusting (Strongly Disagree), sometimes rude (Disagree), thorough (Disagree), make plans and follow through (Disagree), careless (Disagree), not nervous (Strongly Disagree), don't worry a lot (Strongly Disagree), emotionally stable (Strongly Disagree), have an active imagination (Neutral), original with ideas (Agree), and few artistic interests (Agree).

So, I'm reserved, not very trusting, don't get nervous or worried, but I am talkative and original. My income is quite high, which might mean I can afford premium products.

The ad targets staying energized and looking good daily. For someone over 60, these are relevant concerns—staying active and perhaps looking youthful. But as a reserved person who doesn't worry much, maybe the appeal isn't as strong for me.

I'm not outgoing or trusting, so ads that emphasize social aspects might not resonate. Also, since I don't believe in things strongly (Strongly Disagree on trusting), I might be skeptical of such claims without evidence.

The ad is a promotion type, which is common but may lack the personal touch or evidence I'd need to feel convinced. 

For purchase intention: Even though the benefits are appealing, my personality makes me cautious and less likely to be swayed by such ads easily. Plus, having a high income might make me look for more proven or well-established products rather than something advertised this way.

So, when evaluating ad attitude, I'd probably have neutral feelings—neither strongly liking nor disliking, but not finding it particularly interesting or good enough to attract me much. For purchase intention, I'm on the lower end of the scale since I don't feel compelled to buy based on this ad alone.
