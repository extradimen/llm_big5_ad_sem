Alright, I'm a woman from China over 60 years old with a bachelor's degree. I'm married and earn more than 46 million VND a month. My personality traits include being helpful, trusting, thorough, and original but sometimes worried.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It suggests that without the product, negative outcomes occurâ€”fatigue and looking unattractive. This fear appeal could resonate with me because I might be concerned about staying energetic and present, especially if I'm busy or active. The idea of preventing tiredness is appealing.

Considering my personality traits:
- I am thorough, so I value products that offer solutions to potential issues.
- Being helpful and trusting, the ad's straightforward message seems credible.
- However, I worry a lot, which might make me cautious about health-related claims needing verification.

Evaluating the ad's attitude scores:
1. Like: Neutral because while the message is relevant, it's not particularly engaging or dislikeable.
2. Interesting: Agree because preventing tiredness and looking dull are relatable concerns.
3. Good: Neutral since the ad is informative but might lack creativity to stand out.
4. Attractive: Disagree; the message is functional but not visually or emotionally appealing.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase: Strongly Disagree because I prefer to see evidence before buying health products.
2. Try: Neutral as it's a consideration but not certain without more info.
3. Consider: Agree because the product addresses a real need, but I'd wait for reviews or further details.

Overall, while the ad is somewhat relevant and highlights useful benefits, it doesn't strongly persuade me to buy immediately due to my cautious nature and preference for evidence.
