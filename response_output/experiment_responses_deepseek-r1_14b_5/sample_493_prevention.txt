Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." Let me break down how I would approach this as someone with the given demographic and personality traits.

First, understanding my background: I'm a female from China under 20, have a bachelor's degree, not working in any specific field mentioned, divorced, and earn less than 15 million VND monthly. Personality-wise, I'm talkative and outgoing neutrally, not reserved, helpful and unselfish, don't trust easily, not rude, thorough, planful, sometimes careless, get nervous, worry a lot, neutral on emotional stability, have an active imagination? Not really, I strongly disagree there. Also, not original with ideas and have few artistic interests.

Now, looking at the ad: It's targeting feelings of tiredness and dullness without the drink. So it's probably aimed at people who feel that their energy levels or appearance might suffer without it. Given my personality traits, I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so maybe this ad could resonate with me if I'm concerned about looking tired.

But wait, do I relate to feeling tired? Maybe from school or daily activities. The ad suggests that the drink can prevent that tired look. However, as someone who is thorough and makes plans, I might be more focused on the practical aspects rather than just appearance. But also, since I'm not very trusting, I might question the effectiveness of the product.

I don't have strong artistic interests, so the ad's message about looking dull might not hit me as hard. More importantly, my tendency to worry a lot could make me more susceptible to ads that address negative outcomes (feeling tired, looking dull), but at the same time, I'm analytical and would want evidence or proof.

Purchase intention: Since I'm under 20, maybe on a limited budget, I might be cautious about spending money on such products unless convinced. Also, being planful, I might not rush into buying something without considering alternatives.

So for ad attitude:
1. Like the ad? Maybe 3/7 because it's straightforward but might not strongly appeal to me.
2. Interesting? Probably 4 since it addresses a relatable feeling but not in an engaging way.
3. Good? Maybe 5, as it serves its purpose but doesn't stand out.
4. Attractive? Likely lower, maybe 3, because the message is clear but not visually or emotionally appealing.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase? Probably low, like 2/7. Not convinced yet.
2. Try to buy? Maybe 3/7; possible if others recommend it.
3. Consider buying? Perhaps 4/7; might think about it if I feel the need.

I'm not sure if this is exactly right, but considering all factors, these scores seem plausible.
