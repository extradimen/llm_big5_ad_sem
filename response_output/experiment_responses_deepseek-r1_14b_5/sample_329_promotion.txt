Alright, let me break this down. I'm a 20-29 year old male from China with a blue-collar job and a high school education. My monthly income is under 15 million VND, which isn't too bad but not luxury either. I'm currently divorced, so maybe family isn't my top priority right now.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Okay, so it's targeting people who want energy and to look good. As a blue-collar worker, staying energized could be important for my job, but I'm not sure if this drink is something I'd consider.

My personality traits show I'm outgoing (strongly agree) but not talkative. I disagree with being helpful and unselfish, which might mean I'm more self-focused. I'm strongly disagreeing on trusting people, so maybe the ad's credibility matters to me. I'm neutral on being thorough, but I make plans and follow through (agree). I tend to be careless? No, I disagree there. Nervous easily? Strongly disagree, so not an issue. Worry a lot? Strongly agree—so perhaps I'm stressed and looking for solutions.

The ad's promise is about energy and looking good. Energy could help me with work, but the 'look your best' part might appeal more to someone who cares about appearance. Since my focus is on staying energized, that's a plus. But do I believe the ad? My tendency to worry a lot makes me question if it's too good to be true.

I have an active imagination and original ideas (strongly disagree), so maybe I'm not creative but more practical. I don't have few artistic interests either—so perhaps I'm open to new things but not particularly into artsy stuff.

So, for the ad attitude scores:
1. Like it? Maybe 3/7—not sure if it's my cup of tea.
2. Interesting? It has a catchy message, so maybe 4/7.
3. Good? Not bad, but not outstanding—maybe 5/7.
4. Attractive? The visuals and message could be appealing, so perhaps 6/7.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy? Probably not immediately; maybe 3/7.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if I see it in a store, but not sure—so 4/7.
3. Consider buying? It's on my radar, so 5/7.

I think the ad has some appeal for me regarding energy, but trust issues and practicality might hold me back from purchasing right away.
