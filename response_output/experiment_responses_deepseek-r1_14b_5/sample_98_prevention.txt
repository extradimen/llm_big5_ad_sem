Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude scores:

1. **I like the ad. (4)**  
   The ad is trying to create a fear of looking tired or dull without the drink. While it's a common approach in advertising, I'm not particularly drawn to such messages because they play on insecurities. However, it's somewhat effective, so 4 makes sense.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (5)**  
   The message is clear and directly targets a common concern about appearance and energy levels. It's straightforward but not overly engaging, hence a middle score of 5.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (6)**  
   The ad effectively uses fear to highlight a potential negative without the product. While it's manipulative, I can see how it persuades some people, so I give it a higher score here.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (5)**  
   It's visually and message-wise strong but might come off as too pushy or negative to me personally, hence a slightly lower 5.

For purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3)**  
   The ad makes me think about the product in terms of benefits, so there's some interest, but I'm not fully convinced yet. A 3 seems appropriate.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4)**  
   There's enough incentive to give it a shot if I ever feel tired or want an energy boost, so a bit higher than intention, hence a 4.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5)**  
   The ad makes me weigh the options; I'm not dismissing it outright, so a 5 reflects that consideration without strong commitment.
