Alright, let me try to work through this evaluation step by step. I'm a 40-49 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree working as an office worker, married, and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits are talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (disagree), reserved (disagree), helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), trusting (strongly disagree), sometimes rude (strongly disagree), thorough job (strongly agree), make plans (agree), careless (neutral), get nervous easily (agree), worry a lot (neutral), emotionally stable (strongly agree), active imagination (neutral), original ideas (strongly disagree), few artistic interests (agree).

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull."

First, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. Do I like the ad? The tagline is about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink. Since I'm talkative but not outgoing, maybe I don't find it too appealing because it targets a more social or energetic crowd. However, it does touch on something everyone can relate to—feeling tired. But given my reserved nature, I might not feel strongly connected. So, maybe around 3.

2. Is the ad interesting? It's straightforward but could be seen as overused. The message is clear but perhaps not unique enough. Since I'm original and don't come up with new ideas, I might find it a bit uninteresting. Maybe a 4.

3. Do I believe the ad is good? It makes a claim about energy and appearance, which are relevant. However, my tendency to be mistrusting (strongly disagree) might make me question the validity of such claims. So, perhaps a 5, because it's clear but not entirely believable.

4. Is the ad attractive? The imagery and message could be visually appealing if well-made, but without specific visuals, it's hard to judge. Considering I'm emotionally stable and thorough, maybe the ad isn't particularly captivating for me. Maybe a 3.

Now, purchase intention:

1. Intend to purchase: The ad targets tiredness and dull looks. Given my job as an office worker, I might appreciate something that boosts energy, but my cautious nature makes me question if it's effective. So, maybe a 4—leaning towards not intending but considering.

2. Will I try to buy it? Trying would depend on belief in the product. My skepticism and tendency to be thorough make me cautious about trying new things without evidence. Maybe a 3.

3. Will I consider buying it? It's something that addresses real issues, so I might think about it if there are positive reviews or more info. So, perhaps a 4—leaning towards considering but not sure.
