Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with the given demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, let me break down my demographics: I'm from China, female, in my 30s, have a bachelor's degree, am a student, divorced, and earn between 16 to 25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show that I'm talkative (Agree), outgoing but neutral on sociability, reserved (Agree), very helpful and unselfish (Strongly Agree), not trusting (Disagree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), thorough job (Neutral), don't make plans or follow through (Strongly Disagree), not careless (Strongly Disagree), not easily nervous (Disagree), not a worrier (Strongly Disagree), emotionally unstable (Strongly Disagree), and neutral on imagination and originality.

Looking at the ad, it's targeting people who might feel tired and look dull without this drink. It suggests that the drink is essential for maintaining energy and appearance. Since I'm a student with a busy life, maybe this could appeal to me as someone needing an energy boost.

But wait, my personality traits say I'm reserved and don't make plans or follow through (which might mean I'm not very organized). However, being helpful and unselfish makes me consider the well-being of others. The ad's message is about personal appearance and tiredness, which could be a concern for someone in their 30s looking to maintain energy.

On the other hand, being emotionally unstable and not trusting might make me skeptical of such ads. I'm also not one to worry a lot or get nervous easily, so maybe the fear of feeling tired isn't as strong for me. 

Purchase intention-wise, since I don't feel the need strongly enough, I might not intend to buy it immediately, but considering it could be an option.

So, for attitude towards the ad: Maybe neutral on liking and interest because while it's a common message, my traits make me somewhat indifferent or skeptical. It's good as it addresses real concerns, but not very attractive to me personally.

For purchase intention: I might not intend to buy right away (low score), but considering it if needed (higher on consideration). 

I think the scores would be around 3-4 for ad attitude and lower for purchase intent, with a higher consideration.

The advertisement's effectiveness is moderately considered due to its common messaging about energy and appearance, but skepticism from personality traits like being reserved and not trusting leads to a neutral to slightly positive attitude. Purchase intention is low initially but could be considered if personal needs align.
