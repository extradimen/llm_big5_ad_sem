Alright, I'm evaluating this advertisement as a Chinese civil servant in my late 40s. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down how I'd respond based on the traits given.

First, considering the ad's attitude:

1. **Like the ad**: I'm outgoing and social, so ads that resonate with energy and looking good might appeal to me. However, being a civil servant, practicality is key. The ad feels a bit too much like a typical commercial without concrete evidence. So, maybe a 4.
   
2. **Interesting**: It's an interesting concept, but without specific details on how it works or benefits, it's not compelling enough for me to strongly agree. I might give it a 5.

3. **Good**: The message is good, but it lacks depth. Without seeing real benefits or science backing it up, my score would be around a 4.

4. **Attractive**: The idea of looking and feeling good is attractive, but the ad doesn't provide enough to make me strongly agree. A 5 seems fair.

Now, purchase intention:

1. **Intend to buy**: My tendency towards carefulness means I don't rush into purchases without evidence. So, a low score like 3.
   
2. **Try to buy**: I'm cautious but might consider it if others recommend or there's a trial offer. Maybe a 4.
   
3. **Consider buying**: It's on my radar, but not a definite purchase yet. A 5 feels right here.

Overall, the ad doesn't quite hit home because of the lack of detailed evidence and practicality I value in my purchases. But it's not entirely off either; there's potential interest if more information were provided.
