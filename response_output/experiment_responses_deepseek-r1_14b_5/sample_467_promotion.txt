Okay, so I need to evaluate this advertisement as a virtual person with specific demographics and personality traits. Let me start by understanding what the ad is saying: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

First, looking at my demographic profile, I'm a single male in my 20s from China, working as a civil servant with a bachelor's degree and earning less than 15 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing but disagreeing on that point, reserved (strongly disagree), helpful and unselfish (strongly agree), trusting (strongly agree), not rude (strongly disagree), thorough job (disagree), make plans and follow through (agree), tend to be careless (agree), get nervous easily (strongly agree), worry a lot (agree), emotionally stable (neutral), have an active imagination (strongly agree), original with new ideas (neutral), and few artistic interests (strongly disagree).

Now, evaluating the ad. The main points are staying energized and looking good every day. As someone who is talkative and helpful, I probably value products that keep me energetic to interact more with others and perform my duties as a civil servant effectively. However, being somewhat careless and getting nervous easily might make me less concerned about my appearance, but the idea of looking best could still appeal if it's presented in a way that ties into confidence or social interactions.

The ad seems positive and promises benefits that align with being energetic and presentable, which are important for someone in a social role like mine. However, I'm not sure how thoroughly they've tested their claims, especially since I tend to be more of a planner but also sometimes careless. The ad might not address the practicality or long-term effects, which could make me cautious.

Regarding purchase intention: Since I have a lower income, the price might be a barrier. Also, being a bit nervous and worried makes me concerned about the potential side effects or if it's too good to be true. But the idea of staying energized is appealing because as a civil servant, I need to be active and focused daily.

So for attitude towards the ad: I like it because it offers positive benefits that align with my values, but I'm not sure about its trustworthiness due to being sometimes careless and worried. For purchase intention: I might consider buying it if the price is reasonable and there's evidence supporting its claims, but I'm not fully convinced yet.
