Alright, let me break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad is trying to appeal to someone looking for energy and looking good. Given my personality, I'm not very outgoing or talkative, but I do value being helpful and having an active imagination. However, the message seems a bit generic. It doesn't resonate strongly with me because it's not tailored to my specific needs or lifestyle as a civil servant in China. So, I'd give it a 3.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The idea of staying energized and looking good is appealing, but the way it's presented isn't particularly engaging. It doesn't stand out from other similar ads I've seen. Therefore, a middle score like 4 makes sense.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Since the ad doesn't connect with me on a personal level, I don't feel strongly that it's good. A neutral score of 4 seems appropriate here.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visuals and message might be attractive to some, but not really to me. Hence, another 4.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: While the benefits are clear, I'm more practical about my purchases. My monthly income is decent, but I prefer products that have proven effectiveness over time rather than quick fixes. So, a low intent score of 2.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: There's some appeal in staying energized, especially with my job, but without strong personal motivation or specific need, trying it isn't a priority. Another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: The idea is there, but I'm not convinced enough yet. It's something I might think about if others recommend it, so a 4 seems fair.

Overall, the ad doesn't hit the mark for me personally, but it's not terrible either.
