Alright, I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate the advertisement. Let's start by understanding their background and personality traits.

She's a Chinese-speaking female under 20 with a postgraduate degree, working as a civil servant and living with her parents. Her monthly income is between 36 million to 45 million VND, which is quite high for Vietnam, indicating she might have access to premium products.

Looking at her personality traits:
- Talkative: Neutral
- Outgoing and sociable: Agree
- Reserved: Disagree
- Helpful and unselfish: Strongly Agree
- Trusting: Strongly Disagree
- Sometimes rude: Disagree
- Thorough job: Neutral
- Plans and follows through: Agree
- Careless: Neutral
- Gets nervous easily: Strongly Disagree
- Worries a lot: Disagree
- Emotionally stable: Neutral
- Active imagination: Agree
- Original, new ideas: Strongly Agree
- Few artistic interests: Disagree

The advertisement says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, the ad is targeting feelings of tiredness and looking dull. Since she's a civil servant, maybe she has a busy job and might relate to feeling tired. However, her income level suggests she might be interested in premium products that offer more than just energy.

She is outgoing but not talkative, so social appearances matter. The ad uses negative emotions (feeling tired, looking dull) to create a fear of missing out or looking less appealing socially.

Her personality traits show she's helpful and unselfish, which might make her value products that enhance her social image without appearing self-indulgent. She doesn't trust easily, so the ad needs to be credible.

She has an active imagination and is original, so she might appreciate creative ads but could also be critical if the message isn't clear or feels manipulative.

Evaluating the ad's attitude:
1. I like the ad: The negative framing might not appeal to her positive traits. She might not like it because it focuses on negatives.
2. Interesting: It's a common message, so maybe neutral.
3. Good: Not particularly memorable or well-crafted for her.
4. Attractive: The visuals and message are generic; she might find it unattractive.

Purchase intention:
1. Intend to buy: She might not feel the urgency unless the product is premium.
2. Try to buy: Maybe neutral since she's cautious with trust.
3. Consider buying: Possibly low because there's no strong emotional hook for her specific needs.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate strongly with her values and personality, so her scores would be on the lower side.
