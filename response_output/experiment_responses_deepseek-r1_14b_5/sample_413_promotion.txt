Alright, I need to evaluate this advertisement as a Chinese student with specific demographic and personality traits. The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

Starting with my attitude toward the ad:

1. **Like the Ad**: As someone who is reserved (strongly agree) but also talkative (agree), I might not find the ad particularly likable. It seems a bit generic and doesn't speak to me personally. So, maybe a 2.

2. **Interesting**: The promise of energy and looking good could be appealing, especially for a student needing focus. But it's common in ads, so not very interesting. Maybe a 3.

3. **Good**: I generally trust (strongly agree), but the ad lacks specific details about how it works or any credibility markers. So, it's just okay—maybe a 4.

4. **Attractive**: The message is clear, which is good, but I'm not emotionally engaged. It feels a bit too vague and manipulative. So, perhaps a 3.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to Purchase**: I’m cautious about products without evidence. Since the ad doesn't provide specifics, my intent is low—maybe a 2.

2. **Try to Buy**: Without strong reasons or trust from the ad, trying it isn't compelling. Maybe a 3.

3. **Consider Buying**: It's something I might think about if others recommend it, but on its own, not really. So, maybe a 4.

Overall, the ad doesn't resonate enough with me due to lack of detail and personal connection.
