Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad.** The ad is pretty straightforward but seems a bit generic. It doesn't really resonate much with me because I'm not particularly interested in such products. So, I'll give it a 2.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting.** Hmm, the message about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink is okay, but nothing stands out as particularly engaging. Maybe a 3 here.

3. **I believe the ad is good.** The execution is simple, but I don't feel convinced by it. It doesn't really highlight any unique benefits or appeal to my values. So, another 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive.** Visually, if it's well-made, maybe it's okay, but the message itself isn't compelling enough for me. Let's go with a 4.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product.** I'm not convinced by the ad, and I don't feel any strong need for such a drink. So, a 2 here.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product.** Unless there's a specific reason or if I see it on a discount, but no immediate plans. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product.** It's possible in the future if circumstances change, but not something I'm thinking about now. A 4 seems fair.
