Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a 50-59 year old single male from China with a high school education and currently a student. My monthly income is less than 15 million VND.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, evaluating my attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad? Hmm, not really. It seems a bit generic and maybe too focused on negatives.
2. Interesting? No, it's not particularly engaging or unique in its message.
3. Good? Not sure, but it feels more like an attempt to create fear rather than offer something positive.
4. Attractive? Not really; the ad doesn't stand out visually or emotionally.

So, for attitude scores: 1, 2, 3, 4 (all on a scale from 1-7).

Now, purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy? Probably not, since there's no strong reason given.
2. Try to buy? Maybe if it's affordable and convenient, but I'm skeptical.
3. Consider buying? Possibly, but other factors like price and actual benefits would matter more.

So, purchase intentions: 1, 2, 3 (again, low scores on each).
