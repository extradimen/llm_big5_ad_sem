Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement based on their demographic and personality traits. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the person is from China, male, aged between 50-59, has a postgraduate degree but works as a blue-collar worker with a monthly income under 15 million VND (which is around $640). He's married, which might mean he has family responsibilities. Personality-wise, he's talkative but strongly disagrees being outgoing or sociable, so he's more reserved. He's helpful and unselfish, generally trusting but sometimes rude. He doesn't do thorough jobs, isn't good at making plans, is careless, gets nervous easily, and worries a lot—though he disagrees with all these traits, so maybe they don't apply much. He's emotionally stable, has an active imagination, but doesn't consider himself original or artistic.

The advertisement says: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So it's targeting energy and appearance, which are daily concerns.

Starting with his personality: he's reserved, so maybe prefers ads that don't push too hard. But since the ad is positive and about benefits, he might find it somewhat interesting but not overly appealing. He’s helpful and trusting, which makes him more open to believing in the product's claims. However, being sometimes rude and not very thorough or planful might make him skeptical of ads that seem too perfect.

Looking at his age group—50-59—he might be looking for products that support energy levels as he gets older. The drink could appeal to someone wanting to stay active and look good, which are relevant concerns. But his income is relatively low, so the price point matters. If the product is expensive, he might not consider buying it.

His education level is postgraduate but works blue-collar, so perhaps he's more practical in his spending decisions. He might be more interested in the functionality rather than the branding or social aspects of the product.

The ad itself is positive and offers clear benefits—staying energized and looking good. These are universal needs, so he could relate to them. However, since he's reserved, he might not find the ad overly exciting. The ad doesn't seem to target any specific emotional triggers beyond the basic benefits, which might make it less compelling for him.

In terms of purchase intention: he might consider trying it if it's affordable and seems effective. But since he's more reserved and possibly cost-conscious, his willingness to try or buy might be moderate.

So for ad attitude scores:
1. I like the ad.—He might not strongly like it but could find some merit, so maybe around 3.
2. Interesting.—It offers benefits relevant to him, so perhaps a bit higher, say 4.
3. Good.—Overall positive, maybe 4.
4. Attractive.—Not particularly appealing because he's reserved and the ad is straightforward, so maybe 3.

For purchase intention:
1. Intend to purchase—He might not have strong intent unless convinced by price and benefits, so 3.
2. Try to buy—Maybe a bit higher than intend since trying isn't as committed, perhaps 4.
3. Consider buying—More likely to consider if it meets his needs, so maybe 5.

I think these scores balance his personality traits and practical considerations regarding the product's appeal and affordability.
