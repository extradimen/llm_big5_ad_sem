Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for the advertisement and purchase intentions.

Starting with the ad's attitude:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad focuses on avoiding tiredness and looking dull without the drink. Considering my personality traits, I'm talkative? No, I disagree. But I am reserved, which means I might not be immediately drawn to something that emphasizes social energy. However, the message is clear and relatable for someone who values appearing energetic in social settings. Still, since I tend to be more reserved, maybe it's not as appealing. So a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The claim about tiredness and dull looks is straightforward but might not capture my interest deeply. It doesn't tap into my imagination much, which I agree on having an active one but perhaps not in this context. A 3 seems fair.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: For the product to make a difference in appearance and energy levels, it's a common tactic. The message is clear but might feel overused. So, maybe a middle score like 4.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: While the concept is simple, I'm not sure if it's visually or conceptually appealing enough. Given my tendency to agree on having an active imagination and originality, but this ad feels standard. A 3 here.

Now, purchase intentions:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: The ad targets avoiding tiredness and looking dull, which might align with someone who cares about their image. But I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so the fear of appearing tired could influence me. However, my high income might make me cautious about spending on such products unless convinced. So maybe a 4.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Trying it once is possible if the ad resonates, but I'm not strongly compelled. Maybe a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Considering it is likely, as the message touches on social aspects and appearance, which are important. So a higher score like 5.
