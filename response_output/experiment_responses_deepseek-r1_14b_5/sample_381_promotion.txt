Alright, let me try to figure out how I would respond to this advertisement. So, the ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Hmm, okay.

First, my attitude toward the ad. Let's break down each part. 

1. **I like the ad**: Well, the ad is pretty straightforward with a clear message about energy and looking good. But I'm not sure if it's exciting enough for me. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat positive but doesn't really grab my attention much.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The claims are common in ads, so it might not be very interesting to me personally. Probably a 4 since it's okay but nothing stands out.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: I don't have strong feelings about it either way. It's just an average ad without anything particularly impressive. Maybe another 4 here.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The visuals and message are fine, but not really appealing enough to catch my eye. So probably a 5, as it's somewhat attractive but not very so.

Now, moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: I don't feel compelled to buy it right now. There are too many similar products out there without a strong reason to choose this one. A 2 makes sense here.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Unless I see some unique benefit or promotion, I'm not motivated to try it. Maybe a 3 since it's possible but not likely.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: If the product is available and maybe during sale, I might think about it. So a 4 seems right because consideration is there under certain conditions.
