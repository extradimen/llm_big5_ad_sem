Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the given scores for both the ad attitude and purchase intention. 

Starting with the **attitude toward the advertisement**, I need to evaluate each of the four aspects: like, interesting, good, and attractive.

1. **I like the ad**: Considering my personality traits, especially being reserved and not talkative or outgoing, I might find the ad's message a bit too direct or perhaps not tailored to someone more introverted. The statement "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull" feels somewhat manipulative. It uses fear of looking bad to sell the product, which doesn't align with my values of trust and helpfulness. So, I would strongly disagree here, scoring it a 1.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear but not particularly engaging or novel. It's a common tactic in advertising to highlight negatives without the product. While not outright bad, it doesn't capture my interest as someone who values originality and creativity. So, I would give it a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: The ad makes a bold claim but lacks evidence or credibility for me. It's more about creating fear than providing genuine benefits. Since trust is important to me, I don't find this ad trustworthy. Therefore, I score it a 2.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Attractiveness often relates to how visually appealing or emotionally resonant an ad is. This text-based message doesn't create a strong visual impact for me and feels more like a warning than something attractive. Thus, I would rate it a 3.

Moving on to **purchase intention**, I need to assess each of the three statements: intend, try, consider.

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Given my monthly income in VND (16â€“25 million), which is significant but I'm single and might prioritize other expenses over such a drink. Also, the ad's message doesn't strongly resonate with me due to my personality traits, so my intention to buy isn't high. I score it a 3.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: While I have some consideration, there's no compelling reason for me to actively seek out this product. The fear appeal doesn't impact me as much, so I'm not motivated to try it. Hence, another 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: There is a slight consideration because the ad does address potential needs related to energy and appearance. However, my cautious nature makes me hold off without more information. So, I give it a 4, as it's on the lower end of consideration.

Overall, both the ad attitude and purchase intentions are moderately low due to the mismatch between the ad's message and my personality traits, particularly being reserved, trusting, and valuing thoroughness over quick decisions.
