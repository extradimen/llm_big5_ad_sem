Okay, I'm going to try to figure out how this person would respond to the advertisement. Let me start by understanding their background and personality traits.

The person is a 40-49-year-old single male from China with a high school education and works as a managerial employee earning less than 15 million VND monthly. His personality traits show that he's talkative but not outgoing or helpful, generally distrustful, sometimes rude, careless, worries a lot, has an active imagination, isn't original in ideas, and is neutral about artistic interests.

Looking at the ad: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." 

I need to assess his attitude towards the ad and his purchase intentions. 

Starting with ad attitude:

1. I like the ad.
   - The person is talkative but not outgoing or helpful, which might mean he values communication but isn't someone who seeks social interactions. The ad's message about looking good and being energized could appeal to someone who wants to make a good impression, especially since he's in a managerial role. However, his tendency towards being distrustful and sometimes rude might make him question the ad's sincerity.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
   - The ad mentions two key benefits: energy and looking good. These are relatable to many people, including professionals who need to stay alert and presentable. His active imagination could make him consider how this drink fits into his routine, but his careful nature might lead him to seek more information.

3. I believe the ad is good.
   - Belief in the ad would depend on trust. He generally distrusts others, so he might be skeptical about the product's claims unless there's some evidence or a trustworthy source backing it up.

4. I find the ad attractive.
   - The attractiveness of the ad could be influenced by visual appeal and messaging. If the ad is visually appealing and emphasizes looking good and staying energized in a way that resonates with his self-image, he might find it attractive. However, his cautious nature might make him hold back.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
   - Intending to buy would require a strong desire or need. Given his monthly income is less than 15 million VND, which is about $600-700 USD, he might be price-sensitive. The ad's focus on energy and appearance could appeal to him if he feels it meets a personal need, but without trust in the product, intention might be low.

2. I will try to buy this product.
   - Trying would depend on factors like availability and perceived value. If the product is easily accessible and the benefits seem worth the cost, he might consider trying it despite his cautious nature.

3. I will consider buying this product.
   - Considering buying suggests a potential interest but not a definite decision. His tendency to worry a lot and be distrustful could make him weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding.

Putting it all together, his ad attitude scores would likely be moderate because he's neither strongly attracted nor repelled but has some reservations. For purchase intentions, similar moderation applies, with consideration but not immediate action.
