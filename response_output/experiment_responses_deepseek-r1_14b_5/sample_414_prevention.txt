Alright, let's break this down. I'm a male from China, under 20, with a bachelor's degree working in an office, single, and earning around 16-25 million VND monthly. My personality traits show I'm agreeable but tend to be careless and get nervous easily.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." It seems to target someone needing energy and wanting to impress socially. Since I'm outgoing (disagree) but helpful (agree), maybe it appeals a bit, but I don't see myself as someone who feels tired often or cares much about looking dull. However, the ad is trying to create a fear of missing out or social awkwardness.

For attitude toward the ad: The message is clear, so 'like' might be around 3. Interesting? Maybe not too much, so 4. Good? It's okay but doesn't stand out, maybe 5. Attractive? Not really, so 6.

Purchase intention: I'm more about practicality and maybe not into energy drinks if I don't feel the need. So intend is low, like 2. Try might be a 3, consider around 4.
