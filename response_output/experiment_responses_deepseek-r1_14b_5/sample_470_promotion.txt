Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:
1. **Like**: The ad mentions staying energized and looking your best. Given my personality traits, especially being reserved but having an active imagination and originality, maybe it resonates a bit, but not strongly. So a 3.
2. **Interesting**: It's a common message, so I don't find it particularly interesting. Maybe a 4.
3. **Good**: The message is positive, but since the ad feels generic, I'd give it a 5 on being good.
4. **Attractive**: The visuals and message might be appealing to some, but not me strongly, so another 4.

For purchase intention:
1. **Intend to buy**: My monthly income is high, but I'm talkative? No, actually, I'm the opposite. Plus, I don't feel a strong connection to the ad, so maybe a 2.
2. **Try to buy**: Even if I'm not convinced by the ad, my income allows me to try new things occasionally. So a 3.
3. **Consider buying**: There's some interest due to the benefits mentioned, but without more persuasion, it's a 4.

I considered my traits like being reserved and whether the ad speaks to me personally, which it doesn't strongly. My income is high, so I can afford to try products even if not fully persuaded.
