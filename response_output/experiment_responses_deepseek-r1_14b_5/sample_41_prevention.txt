Alright, let me go through this step by step. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree working as a blue-collar worker, living with my parents and earning between 26,000,000 to 35,000,000 VND monthly.

Looking at the ad: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." 

First, I need to evaluate my attitude towards the ad. Let's break down each part based on my personality traits:

1. **I like the ad**: The ad suggests that without the drink, one might feel tired and look dull. It implies that the drink can help maintain energy and appearance. Considering I am helpful (strongly agree) and outgoing but not very sociable, maybe this ad targets people who value their appearance and energy levels. However, since I'm reserved, perhaps I don't find it as compelling. Maybe a 4.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: The message is clear about the consequences of not using the product. It's straightforward but might be too generic. Not sure if it's very engaging for me. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Does this ad effectively communicate its message? It tells you what could happen without the drink, which is a common persuasive tactic. However, I'm more of a planner (agree) and thorough (strongly disagree). Maybe I don't fully trust such a direct approach. So, perhaps a 3.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: The ad's message is simple but might not be visually or emotionally appealing to me. Since I get nervous easily (agree), maybe the ad doesn't speak to my emotions deeply. A 3 here.

Now, for purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product**: As a blue-collar worker with a moderate income, I'm price-conscious. The ad doesn't specify how much the drink costs, so it's hard to commit. Maybe a 4 on intention.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Without knowing the price or benefits in more detail, trying it might not be top of mind. Perhaps a 3.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: It's an option if I feel tired often, but I'm not sure yet. A 4 makes sense here as I'm on the fence.

Overall, my scores would reflect moderate interest and consideration without a strong intent to purchase immediately.
