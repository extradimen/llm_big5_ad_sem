Okay, I'm trying to evaluate this advertisement as a 50-59-year-old Chinese woman with a bachelor's degree working in an office. I live with my parents and earn over 46 million VND monthly. My personality traits include being reserved, helpful, agreeing that I make thorough plans and follow through, but also sometimes rude. I don't like being talkative or having an active imagination.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So first, I think about what this means for me. Since I'm an office worker, staying energized could be important for my job. But I'm also reserved and don't usually seek out new things unless they're necessary. My personality is more about being helpful and thorough but not very imaginative or outgoing.

The ad's message focuses on energy and looking good. For me, looking good might not be a top priority, especially since I live with my parents who might have different values. Maybe they would care more about appearances, but as someone who is reserved, I might focus more on practicality. The drink claims to help stay energized, which could be appealing if it actually works.

I'm doubtful because the ad seems too generic. It doesn't provide specific benefits or evidence. I'm the type who plans things and follows through, so maybe I would look for something that aligns with my routine. But since I tend to be careful and not easily persuaded by ads, I might not trust this one without more information.

Thinking about whether I like the ad: It's neutral because while the message is positive, it doesn't resonate deeply with me. The idea of looking good every day isn't something I prioritize as much as functionality or proven benefits. So I'm neutral on liking it but maybe slightly interesting if I were considering energy drinks. However, since it's just a general statement, my interest isn't high.

Regarding purchase intention: Since the ad doesn't offer specific reasons why this drink is better than others, and I'm not particularly interested in improving my appearance daily, my intent to buy is low. I might consider trying it if someone recommended it or provided more details, but on its own, it's unlikely to make me try it.

So for the attitude scores: Like (3), Interesting (4), Good (5), Attractive (4). For purchase intention: Intend (2), Try (3), Consider (3).
