Alright, let's break down how I came up with these scores. 

Starting with the ad attitude:

1. **I like the ad. (2/7)**  
   The ad emphasizes energy and looking good, which are positive messages. However, it feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out much to me. So, I'm somewhat indifferent.

2. **I think the ad is interesting. (3/7)**  
   While the message is clear, it's not particularly engaging or innovative. There's nothing unique about it that catches my attention.

3. **I believe the ad is good. (3/7)**  
   It conveys its message effectively but lacks depth and a compelling emotional appeal. I don't feel strongly convinced by it.

4. **I find the ad attractive. (2/7)**  
   The visuals might be nice, but the overall concept doesn't attract me much. It's too similar to other ads in the same category.

Moving on to purchase intention:

1. **I intend to purchase this product. (3/7)**  
   I'm not motivated enough by the ad alone to actually buy it. There's no strong reason that makes me want to act now.

2. **I will try to buy this product. (4/7)**  
   If I came across the product elsewhere, like in a store, I might consider trying it, especially if there's more information or positive reviews.

3. **I will consider buying this product. (5/7)**  
   The ad makes me think about whether the benefits mentioned are worth considering. It has some appeal, so I might add it to my list of possible purchases.
