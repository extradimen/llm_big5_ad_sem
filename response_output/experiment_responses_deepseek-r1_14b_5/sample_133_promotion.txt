Alright, let me break this down step by step. I'm a 30-39 year old Chinese woman with a postgraduate degree and currently a student. My monthly income is over 46 million VND, which means I have a decent disposable income. Iâ€™m divorced, so I might be looking for something that can help me in my daily life as a single person.

Looking at the advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So the key points here are energy and appearance. As someone who's a postgraduate student, I probably have a busy schedule with studies and possibly work too, so staying energized could be appealing. Also, looking my best is something many people care about, especially if they're in their 30s and might be concerned about their image.

Now, considering my personality traits:

- Talkative: Strongly Disagree. So I'm not someone who's outgoing or likes to talk a lot. Maybe the ad being energetic doesn't resonate with me as much.
- Outgoing: Disagree. Again, not really into social activities, so an ad that emphasizes social aspects might not be for me.
- Reserved: Strongly Agree. I prefer my alone time and might appreciate products that don't require too much social interaction.
- Helpful: Disagree. Not very about helping others, but the drink is about personal benefits.
- Trusting: Strongly Agree. So credibility of the ad matters a lot to me; if it seems trustworthy, I might be more inclined.
- Rude: Disagree. Not really someone who's rude, so an ad that doesn't come off as pushy or disrespectful would be better.
- Thorough job: Agree. The drink probably has quality ingredients, which is something important for me.
- Making plans: Strongly Disagree. I don't plan much in advance, so the ad should offer convenience without needing too much planning.
- Careless: Disagree. I'm careful with my purchases, so the product needs to be reliable.
- Nervous easily: Disagree. Not someone who gets nervous often, but stress can still affect me.
- Worry a lot: Strongly Agree. I tend to worry about things, maybe this drink could help alleviate some of that stress by keeping me energized and looking good, which might reduce anxiety related to appearance or daily tasks.
- Emotionally stable: Disagree. So the ad should be sensitive to emotional aspects but not overly dramatic.
- Artistic interests: Disagree. The ad doesn't need to be too creative or colorful; simple and straightforward might work better.
- Original ideas: Strongly Agree. I like unique products, so if this drink has a special formulation or concept, it could attract me.

The ad's message is about energy and looking good daily. Given that I'm reserved and value trust, the ad should be credible and not overly enthusiastic. The product being described as helping with energy aligns with my potential need to stay focused during studies, but I don't know if it's a must-have. Also, considering my income level, I can afford such products, but I might be cautious about their effectiveness.

Purchase intention: Since I'm careful and value trust, I might not immediately intend to purchase unless the ad builds credibility. Trying it could happen if there are samples or good reviews. Considering buying is possible, but maybe not a top priority without more information.

Attitude towards the ad: It's okay, but I don't find it very interesting or appealing since my personality leans towards reserved and I'm not highly trusting of such claims unless proven otherwise.
