Okay, so I'm evaluating this advertisement: "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." Let me break down how I would approach this as the user described.

First, considering my background: I'm from China, over 60 years old, a civil servant with a postgraduate degree. My monthly income is between 16,000,000 to 25,000,000 VND. Divorced and male. My personality traits include being talkative (strongly agree), outgoing (disagree), reserved (neutral), helpful (agree), trusting (disagree), sometimes rude (disagree), thorough job (strongly agree), making plans (disagree), careless (neutral), nervous easily (strongly agree), worry a lot (neutral), emotionally stable (neutral), imagination (neutral), original ideas (agree), and few artistic interests (agree).

Now, the ad is about a drink that helps with energy and looking good. Let's think about each part.

1. **Like the Ad**: Since I'm talkative and outgoing (though not strongly so), but I'm reserved, maybe neutral? Or wait, being talkative might make me enjoy ads that are engaging. The ad seems positive, but I don't know if it's targeted towards my age or background. Maybe a 3.

2. **Interesting**: As someone who's original and comes up with ideas, I might find the message a bit generic. So perhaps neutral, around 4.

3. **Good Ad**: Considering the drink's benefits, but without specifics, it feels vague. My thorough nature would question the evidence, so maybe a 3.

4. **Attractive**: The wording is positive, but not compelling for someone who's older and more conservative. Maybe 4.

For purchase intention:

1. **Intend to Purchase**: At 60+, health and appearance might be important, but I'm cautious about products. Maybe a 3.
   
2. **Try to Buy**: Without seeing the product or evidence, maybe neutral, around 3.

3. **Consider Buying**: It's something that could be considered if others recommend it, so perhaps a 4.
