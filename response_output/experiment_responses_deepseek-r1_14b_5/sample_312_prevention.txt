Alright, let me think through this. I'm a 45-year-old man from China who's divorced, earns over 46 million VND a month, has a high school education, and works in 'other' sectors. My personality traits include being talkative (Agree), outgoing and sociable (Strongly Agree), reserved (Strongly Agree), not very helpful or unselfish (Disagree), trusting (Strongly Agree), not rude (Strongly Disagree), thorough (Strongly Agree), but not good at following through with plans (Strongly Disagree). I'm neither careless nor easily nervous, worry a lot (Strongly Agree), emotionally stable (Agree), imaginative (Agree), but not original or artistic.

The ad says, "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product. Let me break down how I'd respond.

First, my attitude towards the ad:

1. Like: The ad is pretty direct but not sure if it's appealing enough. Maybe a 3.
2. Interesting: It makes you think about your appearance and energy, so maybe a 4.
3. Good: As an advertisement, it's functional but lacks depth. A 3.
4. Attractive: Not really; the message is simple and might not stand out. So another 3.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: It makes me consider tiredness, so maybe a 4.
2. Try to buy: Maybe, if I feel it helps. Another 4.
3. Consider buying: Yes, but only after trying. So a 5.

So the scores would be ad attitude [3,4,3,3] and purchase intention [4,4,5].
