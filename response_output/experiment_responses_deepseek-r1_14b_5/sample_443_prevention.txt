Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the scores for this advertisement. First, I need to understand my own demographic and personality traits. I'm a female student from China under 20 with a postgraduate degree, which is a bit unusual but possible in some cases. My income is around 16-25 million VND monthly while living with parents.

Looking at the advertisement: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." The message seems to target people who are concerned about their energy levels and appearance. Since I'm a student, staying alert and looking good could be relevant to me.

Personality-wise, I'm talkative and helpful but neutral on being outgoing or reserved. I tend to agree that I worry a lot, which might make me more susceptible to ads that address stress or tiredness. However, I don't plan much and sometimes feel careless, so the ad's message about feeling tired could resonate if I'm in a situation where energy is lacking.

I scored my attitude toward the ad as 4, 5, 5, 5 because it's somewhat interesting but not overly appealing. The fear of looking dull might not be a strong enough motivator for me to like the ad deeply. For purchase intention, I gave lower scores (3, 3, 4) because while I do worry about tiredness, the ad doesn't provide enough compelling reasons or evidence to make me want to buy the product immediately.

Overall, the ad touches on a concern but lacks depth and convincing elements for me to feel strongly about purchasing.
