Okay, I'm trying to figure out how this person would score the advertisement and their purchase intentions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand her demographic profile. She's a Chinese female in her 20s, has a bachelor’s degree, works as a civil servant, lives with parents, and earns between 26 to 35 million VND monthly. That's a decent income, so she might have the spending power for certain products.

Looking at her personality traits: She is outgoing but not talkative. She finds help and being unselfish important, which makes me think she values social interactions and community aspects. However, she doesn't trust people much and isn’t thorough or good at following through with plans. She tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, which might affect her decision-making. But she has an active imagination and few artistic interests.

The advertisement says: "Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull." So it's targeting feelings of tiredness and looking unattractive without the product. It’s a prevention message, emphasizing avoiding negative outcomes.

Now, evaluating her attitude towards the ad:

1. I like the ad.
She is somewhat outgoing but tends to get nervous easily (Strongly Agree). She might find ads that resonate with her social values appealing. However, she's not very trusting of others and finds thoroughness disagreeable, which might make her skeptical of such ads. The message here talks about looking dull without the drink, which could play into her desire to present well socially. But given her tendency towards nervousness and lack of trust, I'm not sure if she would like it much.

2. I think the ad is interesting.
The ad is trying to create a fear of missing out or looking bad. Since she has an active imagination (Strongly Agree), this might make the ad more vivid for her, making it interesting.

3. I believe the ad is good.
She values being helpful and unselfish, which might align with positive messages, but the ad here is more about personal appearance rather than community or helping others. So she might not strongly believe in its goodness.

4. I find the ad attractive.
The ad could be seen as attractive if it aligns with her desire to look good and feel confident socially. However, given her tendency towards nervousness and maybe being a bit reserved, she might not find it overly attractive.

Now, purchase intention:

1. I intend to purchase this product.
Since the ad is about prevention of tiredness and looking dull, she might see value in it for social reasons. But considering her income is decent, maybe she would consider it if she's convinced by the message.

2. I will try to buy this product.
Trying a new product might be something she considers, especially if she’s looking for ways to improve her appearance or energy levels.

3. I will consider buying this product.
Considering buying could come after some thought. If the ad makes her believe in its benefits, she might add it to her shopping list.

So putting it all together:

Ad_attitude_scores: She's somewhat interested but not strongly positive about liking or believing the ad. Maybe a 3,4,4,4?

Purchase intention: She may have some interest but isn't certain. So perhaps 3,4,5.

Wait, let me think again. The user might not find the ad too likable because she's reserved and not very trusting. But since she is outgoing, maybe it resonates a bit more. So for 'I like the ad' she might give a 3. Interesting could be higher at 4 or 5, but considering her active imagination, perhaps 4. Believes it? Maybe a 4. Attractive might also be a 4.

For purchase intention: She may intend to try it (maybe 4), consider buying (5), and have some intention to buy (3). Or maybe higher scores for trying and considering.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the scale: 1 is strongly disagree, 7 is strongly agree. So if she is neutral on liking but finds it interesting and good, her scores might be lower on like/attraction but higher on belief.

Wait, perhaps 'I like the ad' could be 3 (Disagree), 'interesting' at 4, 'good' at 5, 'attractive' at 4. For purchase intention: Intend to buy at 3, try to buy at 4, consider buying at 6.

No, maybe not that high. Since she tends to be careless and gets nervous, her intent might not be very strong.

Alternatively:

Ad_attitude_scores: [3,5,4,4]

Purchase_intention_scores: [3,4,5]

I think this makes sense because she finds the ad interesting (5), believes it's good (4), but doesn't strongly like or find it attractive. For purchase intent, she may not intend to buy, but might try or consider.

But wait, her monthly income is 26-35 million VND, which is about $1,000-$1,200 USD per month, quite a good income in China. So she might have higher purchasing power.

Given that, maybe she would be more open to trying the product if it's marketed well.

So perhaps:

Ad_attitude: [3,5,4,4]

Purchase intention: [4,5,6]

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact scores. Maybe a bit lower since she is reserved and gets nervous.
