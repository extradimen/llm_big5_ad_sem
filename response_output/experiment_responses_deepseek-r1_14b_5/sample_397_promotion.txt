Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how this person would evaluate an advertisement. Let me start by understanding her background and personality traits.

She's from China, over 60 years old, has a bachelor’s degree, is a managerial employee, divorced, and earns less than 15 million VND monthly. Her personality includes being outgoing, helpful, trusting, but she worries a lot, isn't very organized, and doesn’t have an active imagination.

The ad says, "This drink helps you stay energized and look your best every day." So the key points here are energy and appearance. 

First, considering her age, she might be looking for things that help with energy as people often need more support in that area as they get older. The idea of looking good could also resonate because everyone wants to feel their best.

She's outgoing and helpful, so products that make her feel better and more present socially might appeal to her. Trusting nature means she’s more likely to believe the ad if it seems credible. However, since she worries a lot and is emotionally unstable (according to her traits), the ad should not have any elements that could cause anxiety or doubts.

But wait, she doesn’t make plans well and tends to be careless. That might affect how much she relies on products for daily routines. Also, her income is lower than 15 million VND, which might make her price-sensitive.

Now, evaluating the ad's attitude:

1. I like the ad: Does this ad speak to her? It’s positive and focuses on benefits that matter—energy and appearance. She might agree it's a good thing, but maybe she's not overly enthusiastic because she doesn’t get very excited about products (she has a neutral imagination).

2. Interesting: The message is clear but not particularly unique or exciting. Maybe 3.

3. Good: It’s straightforward and positive, so perhaps around 4.

4. Attractive: Since she's over 60, the visuals might matter. If the ad shows people her age looking good, it could be more attractive to her—maybe a 5.

For purchase intention:

1. Intend to buy: She’s price-sensitive and might not immediately intend to buy unless convinced by the benefits.

2. Try to buy: Maybe she would consider trying it if she trusts the product, but perhaps not strongly.

3. Consider buying: Yes, she might think about it, especially since staying energized is a key benefit for her age group.

So putting it all together, I’d rate her attitude toward the ad as 3, 3, 4, 5 and purchase intentions as 3, 3, 4.
