Okay, here's my evaluation of the "ComfyNest" ergonomic chair advertisement, presented in the requested JSON format, reflecting my profile and personality.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 5, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (2/7):** The ad is incredibly bland. It hits the basic features, but lacks any real hook or personality. Given how talkative and outgoing I am, I expect a bit more *something* from an ad. It’s functional, but not appealing.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (5/7):** The ergonomic aspect *is* potentially interesting, as someone who spends a lot of time working and appreciates efficiency and proper support. However, the presentation fails to emphasize this.
*   **I believe the ad is good (3/7):** It’s not *bad*, per se, but it’s utterly unremarkable. A "good" ad for me needs to be memorable.
*   **I find the ad attractive (2/7):** The description “comfy” and “breathable mesh” isn't particularly appealing. Aesthetic appeal is important, and this ad doesn't offer anything there.
*   **I intend to purchase this product (1/7):** Given my personality, if I’m going to buy something, it will need to be a good value and appealing. The ad doesn’t convey those qualities.
*   **I will try to buy this product (2/7):** I *might* consider it if a friend or colleague recommended it specifically, but the ad alone isn't generating that impulse.
*   **I will consider buying this product (5/7):** The need for ergonomic support is real, and while this ad doesn't excite me, if I was actively searching for an ergonomic chair, this product *could* be in the running.
