Okay, here's my evaluation of the "ComfyNest ergonomic chair" advertisement, reflecting my persona, using the requested JSON format and scoring system.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 5, 4, 4],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad (3):** It's okay. It's not something that jumps out at me. I'm a talkative person, and advertising often feels like just...noise. It doesn’t initially excite me.
*   **I think the ad is interesting (5):** The “ergonomic” and “lumbar support” aspects *do* pique my interest a little bit. My work can be physically demanding and a good chair is actually something I'd be looking for.
*   **I believe the ad is good (4):** It's straightforward and lists features. It's not overly flashy, which I appreciate. It doesn't try too hard.
*   **I find the ad attractive (4):** The color scheme and general presentation are pleasant, but not particularly memorable. It's clean and professional.

*   **I intend to purchase this product (2):** I’m not rushing out to buy it. I'm naturally distrustful, and while it looks decent, I'm skeptical about the actual quality for the price. I'd need to do more research before committing.
*   **I will try to buy this product (3):** I might add it to a "wish list" or keep it in mind if I *do* need a new chair.
*   **I will consider buying this product (5):** The features are relevant to my needs, so I'd likely research reviews and compare prices. It's definitely on my radar.
