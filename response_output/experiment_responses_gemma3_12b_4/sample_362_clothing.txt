Okay, here's my evaluation of the TrendEase jacket advertisement, given my demographic and personality profile, using the requested JSON format. I've tried to be as honest and critical as possible, considering how I'm likely to react.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "clothing",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [4, 2, 3, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 1, 3]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **Like (4):** I'm generally a talkative and outgoing person, and I appreciate aesthetics. The "minimalist design" and mention of looking "confident" *do* appeal to a desire to present well, which is something I value.
*   **Interesting (2):** It's not *super* captivating. It’s a jacket ad. Jackets are practical. It doesn’s spark immediate excitement.
*   **Good (3):** It's a decent ad, well-presented, but doesn’t do anything particularly innovative or memorable.
*   **Attractive (3):** The language is okay, the implied style is appealing (minimalist generally is), but the ad itself isn't visually striking. I’m not getting a strong vibe.

*   **Intend (2):** I don’t really *need* a new jacket. I'm also pretty skeptical about marketing claims.
*   **Try (1):** Very unlikely. My income is decent, but I prioritize experiences and other necessities over clothing.
*   **Consider (3):** I *might* consider it if I was actively looking for a jacket and the price was reasonable (and I could find more information beyond the ad).
