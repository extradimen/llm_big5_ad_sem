Okay, here's my evaluation of the ComfyNest ergonomic chair advertisement, formatted as requested. My background and personality significantly influence my responses. As a divorced civil servant with a decent income but also a tendency towards being blunt and a bit rude, I'm going to be *honest*.

```json
{
  "ad_type": "furniture",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 4, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

**Explanation of Scores:**

*   **I like the ad. (2/7):** It's…fine. Very standard, beige advertising. It doesn't grab my attention. It’s not actively *unappealing*, but it’s not inspiring either.
*   **I think the ad is interesting. (4/7):** It's mildly interesting because ergonomic chairs are a practical need, especially given my job likely involves sitting for long periods. However, the ad itself doesn't *do* anything to make it truly captivating. It's just stating facts.
*   **I believe the ad is good. (3/7):** It's adequate. It hits the basic requirements of an ad. It states the product, mentions features. But it lacks personality or a compelling story. It feels very impersonal.
*   **I find the ad attractive. (2/7):** "Attractive" implies visual appeal or aesthetic pleasure. It’s not visually striking or creative. It’s just a picture of a chair. The color palette is boring.

*   **I intend to purchase this product. (1/7):** No. I'm not in the market for a new chair, and this ad doesn’t motivate me to be.
*   **I will try to buy this product. (2/7):** I *might* look at a website selling ergonomic chairs if my current chair breaks. This ad provides no reason to prioritize this specific brand, though.
*   **I will consider buying this product. (4/7):** If a friend or colleague recommended this chair, I *would* do a little research. I'm practical, so if I needed one, I'm open to a good recommendation.
