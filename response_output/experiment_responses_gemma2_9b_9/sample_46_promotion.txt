**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims feel generic and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I intend to purchase it right away. It would depend on other factors like price and availability.  I would consider buying it if there was a good deal or if I was looking for a new energy drink.
