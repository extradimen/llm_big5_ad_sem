**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on creating anxiety rather than highlighting positive aspects of the product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am leaning towards trying the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. The "may" in the ad makes me cautious â€“ I'd want more concrete information about the product's benefits before committing to a purchase. 


As a reserved individual who gets nervous easily,  ads that play on fear or insecurity can be somewhat effective in grabbing my attention, even if I don't fully trust them.
