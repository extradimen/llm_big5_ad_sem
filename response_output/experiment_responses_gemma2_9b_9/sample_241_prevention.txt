**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my anxiety and tendency to worry, I might be tempted to try the product thinking it will alleviate feelings of tiredness and improve my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials.
