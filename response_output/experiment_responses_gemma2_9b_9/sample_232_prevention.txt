**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not particularly attractive to me. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear rather than appealing to my values or interests.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am somewhat likely to try this product. I worry a lot and get nervous easily, so the promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant might appeal to me. However, I'm not strongly committed to buying it right away. I'd probably need to see more information about the product itself (ingredients, benefits, etc.) before making a decision.
