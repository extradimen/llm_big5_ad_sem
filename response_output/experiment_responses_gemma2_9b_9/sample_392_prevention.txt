**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm generally distrusting and reserved, I wouldn't rush out to buy this product based solely on the ad. However, if I were feeling tired or noticed others using it and seemed more energized, I might consider trying it.
