**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it very attractive. It seems a bit generic to me.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Since I value doing a thorough job and am original (even if I don't have many artistic interests), I might be interested in trying this drink to see if it genuinely helps with my energy levels. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information or seeing some proof of its effectiveness.
