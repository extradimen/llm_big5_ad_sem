**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. I'm not overly enthusiastic about it, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The idea of feeling tired and dull without this drink is somewhat intriguing. It plays on common insecurities.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a basic ad that effectively uses fear to make you want the product. Not particularly creative, but it gets the job done. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might try this drink based on the ad alone. It piques my curiosity.
    * **Try (1):** The low score for "intend" reflects that I wouldn't rush to buy it.  I'd likely wait for a sale or special offer before purchasing.
    * **Consider (3):** Depending on price and availability, I could definitely see myself considering this product in the future.
