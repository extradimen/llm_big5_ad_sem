**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting due to its direct approach and relatable fear of tiredness and dullness, I don't think it's particularly good or highly attractive. The simplicity might feel a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad triggers my worry (I worry a lot!), I'm likely to try this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away as I'd want to research other options and reviews first.
