Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I think the ad is interesting and attractive because it promises energy and a positive appearance (things that appeal to someone in my demographic), I don't find it exceptionally good. The message feels generic.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I am talkative and trusting, I might be swayed by friends' recommendations or even online reviews about this drink. That makes me more likely to try it. However, as someone who is careless and doesn't always plan things out, I might forget to buy it or simply choose something else in the moment.
