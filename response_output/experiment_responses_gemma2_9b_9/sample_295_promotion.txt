**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels generic and lacks specific details that would make me truly interested. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product because the promise of feeling energized and looking better aligns with my desire to maintain a professional appearance and high energy levels in my demanding managerial role. However, I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before committing to buying it.
