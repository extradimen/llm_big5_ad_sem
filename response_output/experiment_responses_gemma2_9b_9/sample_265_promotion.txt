**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is okay, but not particularly engaging. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is something that might grab my attention.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple, straightforward message, but not necessarily well-crafted.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it based on the claims, but I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately. 
    * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I'd give it a try if I saw it at a store or someone recommended it.
    * **Consider (3):**  I would definitely think about it if the price was right and I needed a boost of energy.

**As a cautious, reserved individual who doesn't prioritize trends or appearances, this ad wouldn't strongly influence my purchasing decision.** I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before committing to a buy.
