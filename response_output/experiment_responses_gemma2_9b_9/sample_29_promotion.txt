**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message appealing due to my desire to maintain a positive image ("look your best"), the language feels generic and lacks originality.  I find it somewhat interesting but not particularly groundbreaking or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of staying energized is appealing to me, as my tendency to be careless could benefit from a boost in focus. I'm likely to try this product based on its promise. However, without specific details about the ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it immediately.
