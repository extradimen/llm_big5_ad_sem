**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. It's a fairly common type of advertisement that doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely consider trying this product based on the ad. The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to a desire for self-improvement, which I can relate to. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright or make a strong effort to find it. 


My personality traits, particularly my tendency to be reserved and cautious (disagree with "outgoing," agree with "reserved" and "sometimes rude"), influence my response. The ad plays on common desires for energy and attractiveness, which might resonate more strongly with someone more outgoing and confident. My  distrusting nature (strongly disagree with "generally trusting") makes me less likely to immediately commit to a purchase based solely on an advertisement's claims.
