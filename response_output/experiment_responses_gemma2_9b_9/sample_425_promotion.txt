  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its message across, I don't find it particularly captivating or innovative. However, it's well-constructed and presents a clear benefit.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me want to try this drink. As someone who values being energetic and looking good, the advertised benefits appeal to me. I'd likely purchase it based on this ad alone.
