**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** While I'm not overly drawn to the ad, it does capture my attention. The use of "tired and dull" speaks to potential consequences that could worry me. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad presents a simple problem/solution structure that's easy to understand.
    * **Good (2):**  I think it effectively uses fear tactics, which might resonate with my tendency to worry. However, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing or stimulating to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** The ad makes me think about the product, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately.
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try it if I was offered a sample or saw a more compelling reason to use it. 
    * **Consider (2):** If I were experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness, I might seriously consider buying the product based on the ad's message.
