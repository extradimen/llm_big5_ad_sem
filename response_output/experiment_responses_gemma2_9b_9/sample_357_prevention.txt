**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. I think it's a *good* ad in the sense that it's clearly communicating its message, but I wouldn't call it *attractive* or something I particularly enjoy.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting, my personality traits suggest I'm cautious and prone to worry. The ad preys on those anxieties, making me more likely to *intend* to buy it and *try* it out of a desire to alleviate those feelings. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly. My "careless" nature might lead me to forget about it or find other solutions.
