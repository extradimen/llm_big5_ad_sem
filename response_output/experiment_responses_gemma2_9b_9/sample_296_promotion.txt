Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting because it promises benefits that might appeal to someone like me (staying energized and looking good). However, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or seem particularly well-crafted.  The language is fairly generic.
* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm intrigued by the idea of a drink that could help with energy and appearance, I'd be hesitant to buy it outright. I'd probably try it if someone offered me a sample.  My worry about new products and tendency to be cautious would make me consider it before purchasing.
