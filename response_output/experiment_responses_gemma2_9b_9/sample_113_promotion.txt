**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to wanting to look and feel good. The message is clear and concise. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product based on the ad alone, I wouldn't immediately purchase it.  I would likely want to research more about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
