**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The wording feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties about tiredness and appearance. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product due to its potential benefit of combating fatigue. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further research or perhaps seeing positive reviews from people I trust.  I would definitely consider buying it if I felt a genuine need for an energy boost and found it worked well.
