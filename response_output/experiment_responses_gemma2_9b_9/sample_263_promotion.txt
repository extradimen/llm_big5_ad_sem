Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on common desires for energy and looking good. While I don't personally find it *attractive* or *good*,  it's well-constructed and grabs attention.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad makes me *intend to purchase* and *try* the product. However, I would need more information before committing fully. I worry a lot, so I'd want to know if the drink is healthy and effective. Ultimately, I would *consider* buying it depending on its reputation and reviews.
