**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing on a surface level (interesting, good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad targets general energy and appearance, it piques my curiosity enough to try the product at least once. I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more specific information about its ingredients or benefits. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
