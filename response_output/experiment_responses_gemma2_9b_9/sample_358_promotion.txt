**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly *appealing* (score of 1), I find it somewhat *interesting* (score of 3) and believe it's a decent advertisement overall (score of 2). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to *try* the product (score of 1) based on the promise of increased energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away (score of 1). I would likely *consider* buying it after trying it or reading more about its ingredients/effectiveness (score of 3).  


As a reserved individual who values thoroughness and doesn't easily get swayed by marketing claims, I'd approach this ad with caution. The promise of energy and looking your best is appealing, but I need more information to feel confident in purchasing.
