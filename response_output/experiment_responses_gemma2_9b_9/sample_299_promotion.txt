**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its attempt to communicate a message, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It's fairly generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with some of my values (efficiency and self-improvement).  However, I would need more information about the product itself (ingredients, health claims, price) before committing to a purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
