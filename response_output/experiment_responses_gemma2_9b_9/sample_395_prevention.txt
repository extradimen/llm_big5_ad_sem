**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and think it's somewhat good (score of 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than genuine benefit.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider purchasing the product (score of 3). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it (score of 1) or even try it (score of 1) without further research and information about the drink's ingredients and actual effects. My worry-prone nature (as indicated in my personality traits) might make me skeptical about such claims without solid evidence.
