**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. However, it is interesting because  it touches on themes of energy and appearance which are relevant to my life stage. I believe it's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message clearly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me *intend* to purchase the product and I will likely *try* it. However, given my tendency to worry and be somewhat careless, I might not fully commit to buying it regularly unless I see concrete results and positive feedback from others.  


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any specific score!
