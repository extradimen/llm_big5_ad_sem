**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and conveys a clear message, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough due to the emphasis on looking good, which aligns with my desire to present myself well. However, I wouldn't consider it a great or particularly attractive ad.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product based on the ad alone. The promise of staying energized appeals to me, and "looking your best" is a positive incentive. But I wouldn't be rushing to buy it immediately. I'd likely want more information about its ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision.
