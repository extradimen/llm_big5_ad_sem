**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive to some degree, it doesn't particularly resonate with me. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't align with my personal values of being helpful and genuine.  I'd prefer ads that focus on more substantive benefits or highlight the product's quality in a less generic way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I find the ad somewhat appealing and believe the product might offer some benefit (staying energized), I would consider trying it. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this advertisement alone.  I'd likely need more information about the ingredients, taste, and potential health effects before making a decision.
