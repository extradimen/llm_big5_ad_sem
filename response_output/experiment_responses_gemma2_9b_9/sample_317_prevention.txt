**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive* (1) or *like* (2) it. The  language used ("tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities which doesn't sit well with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feelings about the ad, I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product out of curiosity or if it presented itself as a solution to a genuine problem I'm facing. I'd definitely *try* (1) it first before committing to regular purchases. However, I wouldn't automatically *consider* (3) buying it based on the ad alone.
