**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message relies on fear tactics which I don't usually respond to well.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
