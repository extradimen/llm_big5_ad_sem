**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad fairly appealing and interesting, "good" might be a stretch. It's a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  Given my income and personality (I like trying new things), I'm inclined to buy this drink. However, I wouldn't commit to it immediately.  I'd likely try it first to see if I genuinely like it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to analyze!
