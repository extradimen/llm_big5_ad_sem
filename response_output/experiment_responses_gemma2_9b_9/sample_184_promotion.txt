**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing to a desire for energy and good looks, it doesn't grab my attention in a particularly exciting way. The simplicity of the claims makes me slightly wary.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the concept appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or seeing testimonials from people with similar backgrounds and lifestyles.
