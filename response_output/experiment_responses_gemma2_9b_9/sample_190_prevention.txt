Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is somewhat interesting because it appeals to a desire to look and feel good, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language ("tired" and "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because I worry a lot and tend to be trusting, I might be tempted to try this product based on the ad's claim. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. Before buying, I'd likely research more about the ingredients and potential side effects, as my tendency to be careful sometimes outweighs my impulsiveness.
