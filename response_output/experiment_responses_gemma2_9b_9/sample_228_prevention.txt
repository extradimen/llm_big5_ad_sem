**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't be strongly driven to purchase it based on this ad alone. The claim that the drink prevents tiredness and dullness feels a bit general and lacks compelling evidence.  I'd need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision.
