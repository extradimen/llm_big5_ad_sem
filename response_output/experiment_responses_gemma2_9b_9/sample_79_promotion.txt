**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product. As a blue-collar worker, staying energized can be important. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without knowing more about the ingredients and price. I would definitely consider it if it was affordable and seemed like a good quality drink.
