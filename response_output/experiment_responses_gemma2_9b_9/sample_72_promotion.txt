Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product due to its promise of energy and enhancing appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further information about the ingredients and effectiveness. I'd definitely consider buying it if reviews are positive. My tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about it or choose a different option in the moment.
