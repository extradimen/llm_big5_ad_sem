**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's not particularly groundbreaking. The message is straightforward and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I do intend to purchase this product and will likely try it out. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, even though I wouldn't say the ad was incredibly persuasive. The fact that I worry a lot might make me more receptive to products promising these benefits.
