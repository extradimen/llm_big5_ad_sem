**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad isn't particularly exciting or engaging for me. 
    * **Interesting (3):** I find the idea of a drink combating tiredness and dullness somewhat interesting, as it relates to something I experience.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is straightforward but not particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's visuals and language don't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the drink if it's genuinely effective and reasonably priced, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd be willing to try the drink once, maybe on a friend's recommendation or if it's available for a discount.
    * **Consider (3):** I could see myself buying this drink regularly if I found it helpful and became accustomed to its effects.



As someone who values practicality and directness, the ad's simple message resonates somewhat. However,  it lacks the persuasive power to make me enthusiastic about trying the product immediately. My initial reaction is cautious curiosity rather than strong desire.
