**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make a strong emotional connection. The "dull" imagery feels a bit overused and simplistic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm somewhat intrigued by the product due to the potential benefit of combating tiredness. I might try it, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based solely on this ad. There are other factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients that would influence my decision.
