**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly *attractive*, I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent attempt at advertising ("good", 2).  I don't personally like the way it's phrased - "look your best" feels a little superficial.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'd likely try this product (1) because I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without more information about its ingredients and effects. I'd definitely consider buying it (3) if the price was reasonable and reviews were positive.
