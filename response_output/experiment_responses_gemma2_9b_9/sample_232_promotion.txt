Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claim of looking "your best" feels a bit superficial for my taste.  

* **Purchase Intention:** I'm more likely to try this product due to its energy boost claims, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term. My consideration depends on factors like the product's ingredients and reviews, as I tend to be cautious about new products.
