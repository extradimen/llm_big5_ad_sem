**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent. It's not particularly appealing or unattractive to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I think the ad is alright, I'd likely purchase the product and maybe even try it out. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without seeing more information about it, like ingredients or reviews.  The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit vague and doesn't strongly motivate me to buy.
