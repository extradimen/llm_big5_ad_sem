Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, "good" might be a stretch as it relies on fear-mongering rather than showcasing genuine benefits. It's attractive enough to pique my curiosity, but not something I'd rave about.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad has caught my attention. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately. I'd probably want to see more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a decision. Considering buying it is a safe bet since I'm open to trying new things but also cautious.
