  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 2, 3],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I think the ad is interesting and attractive because it promises both energy and a positive appearance. Those are things I care about as a young professional trying to make a good impression.  While I don't find it exceptionally *good*, it does pique my interest. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the promising aspects, I intend to purchase this product and would likely try it. However, I wouldn't immediately commit to buying it regularly without first trying it and seeing if it actually delivers on its claims.
