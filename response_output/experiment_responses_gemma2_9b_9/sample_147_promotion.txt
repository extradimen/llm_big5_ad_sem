**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of "energized and looking your best" appealing (hence a 3 for "good" and "interesting"),  I don't find the ad itself particularly attractive (1). It's likely due to my preference for simpler, more direct messaging.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me somewhat interested in trying the product (1 for "intend" and "try"). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it right away (3 for "consider"). My cautious nature and tendency to worry might make me need more information before making a decision.
