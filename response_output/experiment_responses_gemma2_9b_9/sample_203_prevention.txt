**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (as it plays on relatable feelings of wanting to avoid looking dull), I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks originality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I value being original and helpful, I would be hesitant to purchase a product that relies on fear tactics (feeling tired and dull). However, I might consider buying the product if there was more information about its natural ingredients or health benefits, presented in a less manipulative way.
