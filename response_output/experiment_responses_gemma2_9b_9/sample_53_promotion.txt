**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The claims about looking your best every day feel a bit oversimplified and maybe even superficial. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this drink because I value staying energized, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. My worry is that the product might not live up to its promises. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
