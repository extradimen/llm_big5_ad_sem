**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad to be somewhat appealing and interesting, it doesn't particularly excite me. I think it's decent but not groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "looking your best" is something I care about, so I would likely try this product. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately, and I'd probably only consider buying it if there was a good promotion or if I saw positive reviews.


My reserved nature and focus on being thorough might lead me to research more before purchasing something like this.
