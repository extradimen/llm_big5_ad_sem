**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad appealing and attractive, I wouldn't call it *good*. The message is common and doesn't particularly stand out.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I would likely try the product due to its focus on energy and appearance benefits. However, I wouldn't be immediately committed to buying it without further research or seeing specific ingredients/reviews. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
