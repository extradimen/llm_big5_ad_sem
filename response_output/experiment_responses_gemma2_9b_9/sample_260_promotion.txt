Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the message clear and easy to understand (hence "good" and "attractive"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It relies on common claims without offering specifics about what makes the drink unique. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough to try the product ("intend", "try"). However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about ingredients, taste, and perhaps testimonials from people similar to myself before making a firm decision ("consider"). 


My personality traits of being cautious ("Sometimes rude" but also "Generally trusting"),  a planner ("Make plans and follow through with them"), and someone who worries ("Get nervous easily", "Worry a lot") influence my response. I need more convincing than a simple claim of energy and good looks.
