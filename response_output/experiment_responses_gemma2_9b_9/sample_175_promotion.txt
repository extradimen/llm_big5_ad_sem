**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, it's not something I'd personally consider "good" or that I strongly like. The language is common and doesn't really stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Given my income level, I could easily afford this product. The ad does pique my interest enough that I'd likely try it, potentially even intending to purchase it if I find it genuinely energizing and beneficial. However, I wouldn't automatically consider buying it based on this advertisement alone. I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects.
