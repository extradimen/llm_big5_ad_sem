**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad straightforward and easy to understand (interesting), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about the product. It feels a bit generic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the drink. However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without seeing more information about its ingredients and benefits.
