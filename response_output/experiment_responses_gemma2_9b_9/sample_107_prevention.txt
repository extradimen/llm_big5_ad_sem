**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's somewhat good (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The scare tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying the product (3).  However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or even try it right away (1). My cautious nature and skepticism towards claims like this would likely lead me to research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.
