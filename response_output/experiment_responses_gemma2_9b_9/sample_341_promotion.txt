  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 2, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message fairly straightforward and appealing. It promises energy and a good appearance, which are things I value. However, it's not particularly creative or memorable. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the promise of the product, I wouldn't rush out to buy it immediately. I would likely try it based on positive reviews or recommendations from friends.  I'm cautious about new products and would consider buying it before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
