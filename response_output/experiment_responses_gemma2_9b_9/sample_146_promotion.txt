**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and conveys a clear message. I wouldn't say I love it, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (2):**  It's not particularly captivating, but it gets the point across.
    * **Good (3):** It effectively promotes the product's benefits in a straightforward manner.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad's design isn't overly flashy or memorable, so I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to purchase the product based on the ad alone. 
    * **Try (1):**  The promise of staying energized and looking better appeals to me, so I would definitely give it a try.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad doesn't make me enthusiastically want to buy it, but I'd probably consider it if I was already looking for an energy drink or needed a boost.
