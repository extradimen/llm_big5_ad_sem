**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look good), it doesn't particularly excite me. The simplicity of the claim makes it interesting enough to notice but not overwhelmingly positive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and improved appearance does make me consider trying this product. My "agree" response on making plans and following through suggests I might actually purchase it after trying it. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it without giving it a test run. The worry I feel (as indicated by my "agree") could make me hesitant to commit to a full purchase until I have more information about the product.
