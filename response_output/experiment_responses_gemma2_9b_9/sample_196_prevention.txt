**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good in its simplicity, I'm not particularly drawn to it. The "you may feel tired and look dull" approach feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  I'm likely to try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
