**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It feels a bit manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and might be tempted to try the product, my intention isn't firm. I would consider buying it if I were looking for an energy boost, but I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. 


My personality traits influence these scores.  I am a planner and tend to make decisions thoughtfully, so I wouldn't be swayed by a simple ad. My preference for doing thorough research would likely lead me to investigate the product further before making a purchase.
