Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive score of 1). The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't resonate strongly with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be willing to try this drink, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. If I saw it at a store or someone offered me one, I'd probably give it a go (intend & try scores of 1). However, it's not something I'd actively consider buying based on this ad alone (consider score of 3).
