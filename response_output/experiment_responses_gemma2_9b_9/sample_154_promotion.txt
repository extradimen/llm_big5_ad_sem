**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly exciting or memorable. The claims about energy and looking your best feel generic and don't really grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my worry and tendency to be careless, I might try this product out of curiosity if it was affordable and easily accessible. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be strongly inclined to buy it based solely on this ad.
