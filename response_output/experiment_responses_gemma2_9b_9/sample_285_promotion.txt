**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not necessarily dislikeful, the ad doesn't particularly grab my attention. It's a common message.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat appealing, as it relates to maintaining vitality in later life. 
    * **Good (2):**  The ad is clear and concise, but lacks something unique or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't use imagery or language that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider trying the product based on the claims, but not with strong intention right now.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," a willingness to try it exists, but not a firm commitment.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me think about the product and its potential benefits, so I would likely consider buying it if given the opportunity.
