**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't grab my attention strongly. It feels a bit generic and doesn't offer anything particularly unique or compelling.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the promise of feeling energized appeals to me. I do get nervous easily and worry sometimes, so the idea of a boost might be attractive. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  I'd likely wait for a sale or see if I hear positive reviews from others before committing.
