**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to connect with potential customers, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The "look dull" statement feels a bit too dramatic and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product based on the ad. The "tired" aspect could be relevant to my busy lifestyle. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it immediately.
