  "purchase_intention_scores": [2, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good â€“ things that are important in my social life. While not particularly groundbreaking or creative, the message is clear and relatable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product.  The ad isn't compelling enough for me to immediately buy it, but the idea of trying a drink that promises energy and improved appearance is tempting. I wouldn't consider it a priority purchase though.
