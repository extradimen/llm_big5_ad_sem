**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or make me feel strongly about it. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which makes me less receptive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to consider buying the product because I worry about feeling tired and looking dull, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad has sparked some thought, but I need more information before making a decision.
