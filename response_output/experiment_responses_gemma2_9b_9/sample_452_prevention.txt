**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally like it. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  It doesn't resonate with me as someone who values authenticity over outward appearances.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not liking the ad, I might try this product because I sometimes make impulsive decisions (careless tendency) and get nervous easily. The promise of feeling more energized could appeal to my anxiety about being inadequate. However, I wouldn't intend to buy it regularly or consider it a necessity.
