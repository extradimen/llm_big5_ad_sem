**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks a unique hook or creative execution. It's a common promise in many drink advertisements.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire for energy and looking good, and given my "helpful and unselfish" nature, I might buy this drink to share with others or use during social gatherings.
