I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt at promoting their product. While I don't find it particularly attractive, the message of feeling energized and looking good resonates with me. As someone who is outgoing and talkative, I always want to put my best foot forward.  This makes me likely to try the product, but not necessarily commit to purchasing it right away.
