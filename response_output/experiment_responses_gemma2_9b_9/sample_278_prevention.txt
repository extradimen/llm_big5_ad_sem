**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    *  **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on common insecurities about feeling tired and looking dull, which might grab my attention. 
    * **Good (2):** While it's a bit basic, it gets the point across. 
    * **Like (2):** I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it, but it's not something I actively dislike either.
    * **Attractive (1):**  It's not visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to try the product based on curiosity.
    * **Try (1):** I wouldn't buy it outright without more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits. 
    * **Consider (3):** If I see positive reviews or hear good things about it from friends, I'd be more inclined to consider buying it regularly.
