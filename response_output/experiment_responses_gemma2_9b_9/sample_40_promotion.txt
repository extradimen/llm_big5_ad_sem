**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is fairly straightforward and uses common appeal points like energy and appearance, I find it somewhat bland. It doesn't particularly stand out or spark my interest strongly (hence the lower scores). However, it's not bad either, just average.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (especially "I worry a lot" and "I tend to be careless"), I'd likely be hesitant about trying new drinks without more information. I'd probably look for reviews or details about the ingredients before committing. But, seeing as the ad promises benefits I find appealing (energy and looking good), I wouldn't completely dismiss it and might give it a try eventually.
