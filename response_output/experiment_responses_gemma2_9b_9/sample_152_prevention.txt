**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  it doesn't particularly appeal to me or grab my attention aesthetically. The language used is a bit generic and lacks specifics about what makes the drink effective.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend:** I might buy this product if I was feeling particularly tired or needing a boost. However, it's not something I actively seek out.  
    * **Try:** I would likely be willing to try it once, maybe even share it with someone else. 
    * **Consider:** Ultimately, the decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and any positive reviews I might hear. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
