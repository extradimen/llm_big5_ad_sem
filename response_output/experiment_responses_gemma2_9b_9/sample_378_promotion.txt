**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of feeling energized and looking good appealing (hence "good" and "attractive"), it doesn't grab my attention in a particularly unique or exciting way.  I think it's interesting enough to take note of, but not something that would stick with me long-term.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to *try* the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably consider it if I saw it in a store or heard good reviews from friends. However, my tendency to be careless and get nervous easily might make me hesitate on a full commitment.
