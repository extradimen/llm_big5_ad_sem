  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's good (2), I don't personally find it very likeable (2) or attractive (1). The wording feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which doesn't appeal to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying the product (3) because the ad plays on my worry (I "worry a lot") about appearing tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or try it (1) right away.  I'd probably do more research first and see if there are other options.
