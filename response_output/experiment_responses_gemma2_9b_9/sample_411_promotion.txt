**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at marketing, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't resonate with me on a deeper level.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat interested in trying the product because the claim of staying energized aligns with my desire for efficiency in my busy schedule. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research and perhaps seeing reviews from people with similar lifestyles to mine.
