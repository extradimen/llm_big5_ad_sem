Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (4):** I find the ad's message appealing on a basic level.  Staying energized and looking good are things many people desire.
    *  **Interesting (3):** It's not particularly unique or attention-grabbing, but it gets the point across clearly.
    *  **Good (2):** The ad is well-constructed and easy to understand, but lacks a strong emotional hook for me personally.
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't say the ad is visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink, but it's not something I actively plan on purchasing right now. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw this product at a store, I might be tempted to give it a try.
    * **Consider (2):** Based solely on the ad, I would definitely put it in the "maybe" category.  I'd need more information about ingredients, price, and reviews before making a decision. 



As someone who worries a lot and values thoroughness, I'd likely research this product more before buying. The ad doesn't provide enough specific details to convince me.
