**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting, but not something I'd actively seek out.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull is relatable, even if it's a bit exaggerated. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the point across, but I don't think it's particularly well-made or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing to me, and the message itself isn't exciting.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might buy this product if I was feeling tired or saw a good deal, but it's not something I would actively seek out.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," it's a maybe based on circumstance rather than desire. 
    * **Consider (2):** If friends were talking about it or if it became popular, I might be more inclined to consider buying it.



My personality traits like being reserved, worrying a lot, and not being very original likely influence my response.  I'm not easily swayed by advertising, and the ad's focus on negative emotions doesn't particularly appeal to me.
