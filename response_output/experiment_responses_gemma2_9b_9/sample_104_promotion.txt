**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I am intrigued enough by the promise of staying energized and looking my best to try this product. However,  I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely want to read more about the ingredients and perhaps see if anyone I trust has tried it before making a decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
