**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, it doesn't particularly excite or attract me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad plays on my worries (I worry a lot!) by suggesting tiredness and dullness are negative outcomes. This makes me more likely to consider purchasing the drink. However, I wouldn't immediately rush to buy it without further information about its ingredients and effects.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
