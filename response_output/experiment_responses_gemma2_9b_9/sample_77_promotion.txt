**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it speaks to a desire for feeling energetic and looking good, which are common concerns. I think it's *good* in that it's clear and gets its message across. However, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I worry a lot and tend to get nervous easily, the idea of needing something to stay energized and look my best makes me somewhat anxious. 
I might *intend* to buy this product because I want to feel better about myself. I'd also be willing to *try* it to see if it works. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it until I had more information or tried it myself.
