}
``` 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's not an ad I'd actively seek out, but it's pleasant enough.  The language is straightforward and positive. 
    * **Interesting (4):** The promise of energy and looking good appeals to a desire for self-improvement which resonates with me.
    * **Good (3):** It's clear and concise in its message. I don't find it particularly clever or memorable, but it gets the point across.
    * **Attractive (2):**  It's not visually striking or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy it, especially if I see it in a convenient location or on sale.  
    * **Try (2):** Given my openness to trying new things and my social nature, I'd probably be willing to give it a shot based on the ad alone.
    * **Consider (3):** There are definitely other factors that would influence my decision, like price, reviews, or personal preferences for healthier alternatives.
