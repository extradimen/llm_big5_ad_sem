**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* because it clearly states a benefit. However, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *likeable*. The language is generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I wouldn't rush out to buy this drink based solely on the ad, I am *intending* to purchase it and would *definitely try it* if given the opportunity. The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" appeals to me as a practical benefit. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
