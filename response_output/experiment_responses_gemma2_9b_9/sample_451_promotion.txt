**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message simple and understandable, it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims about staying energized and looking good are common in many advertisements.  I find it interesting enough to read but wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I work a demanding job and value efficiency, the promise of energy boosts is appealing. However, I'm cautious about claims like "look your best." I'd be willing to try the product based on that potential benefit, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd likely consider buying it after trying it or reading more reviews.
