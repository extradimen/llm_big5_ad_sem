**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The phrasing "you may feel tired and look dull" feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be careless and not very thorough, I might initially consider buying the product if I see it at the store. However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.  I'd likely need more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
