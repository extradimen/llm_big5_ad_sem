**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good,  I don't personally like it. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull"), which I tend to find manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention:** Despite not liking the ad, I might be persuaded to try the product due to my tendency to worry a lot (even though I don't get nervous easily).  I might consider buying it if I see positive reviews or recommendations from trustworthy sources. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based on this advertisement alone.
