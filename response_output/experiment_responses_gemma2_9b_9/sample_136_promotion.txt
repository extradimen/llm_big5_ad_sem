**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The claims are common in marketing, so nothing really stands out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because of the promise of staying energized and looking my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately without further research or seeing positive reviews from others.  I would definitely consider buying it if it seemed effective and aligned with my lifestyle. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
