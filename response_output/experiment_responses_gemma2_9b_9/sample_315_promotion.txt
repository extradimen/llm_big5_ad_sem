**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and potentially good, it doesn't grab me strongly. The claims of "stay energized and look your best" are common and don't feel particularly unique or compelling.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad. The promise of increased energy and appearance improvement aligns with my desire to maintain a youthful image. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research or personal recommendations.
