**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough because everyone wants to feel energized and look their best, but it lacks something special to make me love it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my worry and nervousness, I'd likely try this drink as a way to feel more confident and put-together. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without researching more about the ingredients and potential side effects. I'd definitely consider buying it if it had good reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
