**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad mildly interesting. It's simple and uses common claims ("energized," "look your best"). 
    * **Interesting (2):**  It piques my curiosity enough to read it, but not strongly so. 
    * **Good (3):** The ad is clear and conveys its message effectively. I can understand what the product is supposed to do.
    * **Attractive (1):** It's not particularly eye-catching or appealing to me aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I am unlikely to actively seek out this product. 
    * **Try (1):** If I saw it at the store and was in need of a similar drink, I might give it a try.
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me somewhat more open to considering this product if I'm already looking for something like it.  



As a reserved individual who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I wouldn't be heavily swayed by advertising claims. My purchase decisions are likely influenced more by practical needs and trusted recommendations than catchy slogans.
