**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative. While it uses relatable feelings (tiredness, looking dull), it doesn't offer much substance or detail about how the drink actually helps.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I'd be hesitant to make a purchase based solely on this ad. However, if I saw positive reviews or experienced firsthand the effects of tiredness, I might consider trying the product.
