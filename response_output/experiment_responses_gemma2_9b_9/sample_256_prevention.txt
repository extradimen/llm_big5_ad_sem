**Explanation:**


* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my concern about looking dull. While I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive, the message resonates with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and get nervous easily, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is concerning.  I would definitely intend to purchase this product and try it. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it without further research or seeing testimonials from others. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
