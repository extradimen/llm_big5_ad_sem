**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product because the ad plays on my desire to be energetic and look my best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I'd likely consider other options or research more about the product before making a decision. My preference leans towards natural solutions for energy and well-being rather than relying on drinks.
