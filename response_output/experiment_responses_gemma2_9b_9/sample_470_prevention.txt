  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it presents a clear problem), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough to want to try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd likely consider it based on further information about its effectiveness and ingredients.


My personality traits like being reserved and cautious, coupled with a tendency to worry and get nervous easily, might make me hesitant to jump into trying new products without more research.
