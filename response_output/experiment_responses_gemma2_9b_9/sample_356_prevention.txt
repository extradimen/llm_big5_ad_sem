**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive.  The "dull" imagery doesn't resonate with me strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because the ad plays on a fear of feeling tired and looking dull (a concern that resonates with some people). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or actively seek it out. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
