**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it's not something that deeply grabs my attention. It feels a bit generic and relies on common marketing tropes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the promise of energy and improved appearance is somewhat enticing. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to buy it right away without further research or seeing reviews. The "consider" score reflects my cautious nature (as indicated by the "worried" and "trusting" traits).
