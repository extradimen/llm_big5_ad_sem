**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims are fairly common in this type of advertising. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product. Since I value being energized and looking my best (as stated in the ad), I might be willing to give it a shot, but I wouldn't make a definite decision right away.
