I find the ad interesting and believe it is a good advertisement because it clearly states the benefits of the drink. However, I don't necessarily find it attractive and as someone who tends to be reserved and not very talkative,  I wouldn't readily share it with others.

While I find the ad compelling enough to try the product, my purchase intention isn't strong because I usually don't rely on advertising to make purchasing decisions.
