**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The claims about "looking your best" feel superficial and don't resonate with my values of being helpful and unselfish.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. Considering the purchase depends on factors like price and seeing genuine testimonials rather than just general claims about energy and appearance. 



My personality traits as a reserved yet sociable person who worries and values genuineness likely influence my response to this ad.  The focus on outward appearances doesn't align well with my internal priorities.
