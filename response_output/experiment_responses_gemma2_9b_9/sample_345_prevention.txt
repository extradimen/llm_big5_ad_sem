**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on a common concern about feeling tired and looking dull. 
    * While it's not particularly **likeable (2)** or **attractive (1)**, it does grab my attention.
    * I believe it's a **good (2)** advertisement in that it clearly conveys its message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I am **likely to try (1) this product** due to the ad's appeal to my desire to avoid feeling tired and dull. 
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily **intend (1)** to purchase it outright without further research or trying a sample first.
    * I would definitely **consider (3)** buying it if I found it effective and reasonably priced.



**Additional Notes:**

My personality traits, such as being reserved and agreeing that I worry a lot, might make me more susceptible to ads that promise solutions to common concerns like tiredness. My preference for thoroughness would also likely lead me to research the product before making a purchase decision.
