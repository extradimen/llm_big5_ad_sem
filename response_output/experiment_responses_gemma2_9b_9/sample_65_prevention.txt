**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*.  The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be persuaded to *try* the product based on curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I would definitely *consider* purchasing it if I saw positive reviews or heard good word-of-mouth.
