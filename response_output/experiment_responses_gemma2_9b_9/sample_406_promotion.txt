  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright. I'd need more information about the ingredients, taste, and potential benefits before making a firm decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
