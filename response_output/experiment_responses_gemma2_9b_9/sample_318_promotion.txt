**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (score of 4), I wouldn't call it "like" or "attractive" in a strong sense. It feels generic and doesn't particularly stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more inclined to try this product due to its focus on energy and appearance, which aligns with my desire to stay productive as a student. However, I wouldn't make a definite purchase commitment until I had more information about the ingredients and potential side effects (score of 3).  My worry tendencies might also lead me to research thoroughly before purchasing.
