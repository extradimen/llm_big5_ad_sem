**Explanation:**


* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its simplicity and direct message, I don't personally like it. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull feels a bit manipulative and doesn't resonate with me.  I wouldn't consider it attractive either.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired (which I tend to experience frequently). However, I am not ready to intend a purchase or fully consider buying it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
