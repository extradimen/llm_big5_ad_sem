**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and believe it's decent overall (score 2), I don't particularly like it (score 2) or find it attractive (score 1). The language used feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product (score 3). However, due to my personality traits (like being generally cautious and prone to nervousness), I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (score 1) or even actively try to buy it (score 1).  I'd likely want more information about the drink's ingredients and potential effects before making a decision.
