**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The scare tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  feel a bit manipulative and not very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the persuasive nature of the ad, I might be inclined to try the product once out of curiosity (score 1 for "try"). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly (score 1 for "intend") and would likely consider purchasing it again based on my experience (score 3 for "consider").
