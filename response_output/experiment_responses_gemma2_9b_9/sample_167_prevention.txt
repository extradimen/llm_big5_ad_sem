**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and relies on fear-mongering rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try the product out of curiosity due to the "may feel tired" aspect playing on my worry about feeling sluggish. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. The ad doesn't convince me enough to consider it a necessity.
