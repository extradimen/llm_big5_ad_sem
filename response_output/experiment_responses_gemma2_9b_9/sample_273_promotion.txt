Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to promote the drink, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive.  The messaging is pretty generic and doesn't stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my worry (Agree) and somewhat distrusting nature (Strongly Agree), I'd be hesitant about buying something just based on a general claim like "stay energized and look your best." However, if the drink had specific benefits or testimonials from people I trust, it might make me more likely to try it.
