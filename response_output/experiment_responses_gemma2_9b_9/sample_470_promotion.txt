**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at promotion, I don't personally find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common and don't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  

    * **Intend to Purchase:** As a student juggling my studies, I might consider this drink if there was more emphasis on its specific benefits for concentration or focus.
    * **Try to Buy:** The ad piques my interest enough that I might try it once, especially if there's a promotion or sample available.
    * **Consider Buying:**  Ultimately, unless the product offered something unique or targeted towards my needs as a student, I would likely not make a regular purchase. My decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and reviews from others.
