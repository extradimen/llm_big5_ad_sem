**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing and interesting (scores of 4 and 3 respectively), I don't think it's exceptional. It uses common phrases to appeal to a broad audience.  The "look your best" part doesn't particularly resonate with me, as my focus isn't solely on outward appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized is something I could use. As someone who worries and gets nervous easily, the idea of feeling more energized is appealing (hence scores of 1 and 1 for "intend" and "try"). However,  I would need to see more information about the drink's ingredients and effects before committing to a purchase (score of 2 for "consider"). I might be swayed by more specific benefits or testimonials.
