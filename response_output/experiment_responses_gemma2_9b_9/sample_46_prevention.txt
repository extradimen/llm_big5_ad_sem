**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I don't personally find it attractive. The "prevention" angle appeals to my tendency to be sometimes rude to others by suggesting a consequence for not using the product (looking dull).  However,  I wouldn't necessarily purchase it right away. I might try it out if given the opportunity or consider buying it if I felt genuinely tired and lacking energy.
