**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is intriguing and gets my attention (interesting, good), I don't find it particularly attractive or appealing in terms of aesthetics or persuasive language. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further research or seeing testimonials about its effectiveness.  I would definitely consider buying it if I were experiencing fatigue and looking for a quick solution.
