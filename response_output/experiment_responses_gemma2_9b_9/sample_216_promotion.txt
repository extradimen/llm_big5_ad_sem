  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive to some degree, it doesn't particularly "speak" to me. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in advertising and don't feel unique or compelling.  I score them as 3, 2, 4, and 2 accordingly.

* **Purchase Intention:**  Because the ad targets a desire for energy and appearance enhancement, I am more likely to at least try the product. However, without more specific information about ingredients or benefits, I wouldn't feel confident enough to intend a purchase right away. That's why my scores are 1, 1, and 3. 



Remember, as someone who is "sometimes rude" and  "generally distrusting," I'm likely to be skeptical of marketing claims unless they are backed up by strong evidence or come from a source I trust.
