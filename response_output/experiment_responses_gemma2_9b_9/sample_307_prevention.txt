Let's break down my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative to me, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.  I wouldn't call it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my curiosity and makes me want to *try* the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it based solely on this ad. I'd need more information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and price before committing.  I would definitely *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
