**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I don't particularly *like* it. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I tend to find manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me somewhat inclined to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily "intend" to purchase it right away. My careful nature would likely lead me to research other options and compare them before making a decision.
