**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I **like** the ad (3): It's simple and gets the point across. While not overly creative, it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull.  
    * I **think** the ad is interesting (2): It's attention-grabbing enough to make me pause. 
    * I **believe** the ad is good (3): It effectively uses fear-based marketing to potentially persuade me.
    * I **find** the ad attractive (2):  It's not visually appealing, but it's straightforward and gets the message across.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend** to purchase this product (1): The ad is likely to influence my decision, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it immediately. I need more information about the product itself before committing.
    * I **will try** to buy this product (1):  I'm curious enough to give it a shot based on the ad alone. 
    * I **will consider** buying this product (3): The ad definitely puts this product on my radar. However, other factors like price and availability would heavily influence my final decision.
