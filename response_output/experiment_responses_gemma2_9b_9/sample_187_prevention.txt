**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it plays on a common concern about looking tired and dull. While I think it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally find it *likeable* or *attractive*.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me *intend* to try the product or at least *try* it. However,  I would likely only *consider* buying it if there were other positive factors influencing my decision (like reviews, recommendations, or a specific need for an energy boost). 


As someone who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I'm not easily swayed by advertising. The ad's appeal is based on fear ("Without this drink...") which doesn't resonate strongly with me.
