**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive. While it's a common message, "look your best every day" resonates with me as someone who values appearances (though I wouldn't necessarily call myself "outgoing").  I think it's a decent ad but not particularly groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality traits and income level, I'd likely try this drink. I am generally trusting and open to new things, especially if they promise benefits like increased energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without trying it first and seeing if the claims hold true.
