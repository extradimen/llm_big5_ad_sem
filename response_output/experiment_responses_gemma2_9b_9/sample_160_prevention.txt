**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses a fear tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), I find it somewhat interesting (4) because it appeals to my desire to be outgoing and sociable. However, I don't necessarily believe it's good (2) or attractive (1).  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me slightly curious about the product (3), so I might consider buying it (2). I wouldn't intend to buy it right away (1), but I would likely try it once if given the opportunity (1).
