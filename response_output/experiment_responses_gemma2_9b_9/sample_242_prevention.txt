**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message isn't particularly inspiring or groundbreaking, I find it somewhat interesting (3) because it appeals to a basic human desire for energy and vitality.  I don't think it's a particularly good ad overall (2), and I wouldn't call it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative and lacks specifics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's vague claims, I'm unlikely to purchase this product outright (intend - 1). However,  I might try it (try - 1) out of curiosity or if it was heavily discounted. I would definitely consider buying it (consider - 3) if they provided more concrete evidence about its effectiveness and less emphasis on fear-based tactics.
