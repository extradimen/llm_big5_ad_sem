**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The message is a bit generic and doesn't speak to any specific needs or concerns I have.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend to purchase:**  The ad makes me curious enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't say I'm actively planning on buying it. 
    * **Try to buy:** It's possible I'd pick up the drink if I saw it at the store and was looking for a beverage.
    * **Consider buying:**  Ultimately, my decision would depend on factors like price, taste reviews, and whether there are healthier alternatives available. My worry about potential health effects (not mentioned in the ad) might also influence my choice.
