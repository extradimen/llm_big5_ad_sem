**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language ("feel tired," "look dull") is a bit common and lacks the originality I typically look for in advertising.  I'm not one to easily fall for these types of claims, but I might be swayed enough to try the product if I happen to see it at the store or hear more about it through other channels.
