Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at promotion, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product because I'm always looking for things to keep me energized. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without trying it first. Since I'm not easily swayed by advertising, I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision.
