**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about energy and looks are common tropes that don't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a strong commitment to purchase. My cautious nature and focus on other priorities would likely prevent me from consistently buying this product.
