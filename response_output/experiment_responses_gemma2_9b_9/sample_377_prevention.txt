**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's generally well-made, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit superficial and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider trying the product because I worry about looking tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even actively try to find it. My tendency to be careless might lead me to forget about it easily.
