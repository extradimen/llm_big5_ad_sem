**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "tired and dull" message feels a bit overused and manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because I am generally helpful and unselfish and want to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without trying it first. Considering the ad's lack of strong appeal, I'd be cautious about buying it based solely on the advertisement.
