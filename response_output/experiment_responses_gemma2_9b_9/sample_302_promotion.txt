**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its straightforward message, I don't think it's particularly good or groundbreaking. The claims are common in this type of advertising.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. I might even try to find it and buy it soon. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider it a top priority or make a special effort to buy it if it wasn't readily available. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
