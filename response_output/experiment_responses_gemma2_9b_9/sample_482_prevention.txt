**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about looking dull or tired.  I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Even though I don't love the ad, the message does resonate with me on some level. I worry a lot and sometimes feel tired, so the idea of a drink that could potentially combat those feelings is appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I would likely *try* it if someone offered it to me or if I saw it at a good price, but I wouldn't actively go out and purchase it based on this ad alone.
