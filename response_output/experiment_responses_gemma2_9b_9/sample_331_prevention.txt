} 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **I like the ad/interesting/good/attractive:**  While I don't find the ad particularly appealing, I think it is interesting because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. The scores are low because as a reserved person, I don't easily get swayed by emotional appeals.

* **Intend to purchase/try/consider:** I might consider buying this product because I worry a lot and the ad suggests a solution for feeling tired and "dull". However, as someone who tends to be careless and doesn't always follow through with plans, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out. 


My personality traits make me more skeptical of advertising claims.  I need more concrete information about the product's effectiveness before being convinced to purchase it.
