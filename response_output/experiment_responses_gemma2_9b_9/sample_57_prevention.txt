**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and looking dull.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials.
