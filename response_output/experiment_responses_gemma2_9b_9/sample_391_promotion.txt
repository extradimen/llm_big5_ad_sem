**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message relatively straightforward and easy to understand (hence a 3 for "like"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as exceptionally well-crafted.  I consider it decent but not remarkable.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of increased energy and improved appearance appeals to me on some level, given that I value looking and feeling my best. However, as someone who is cautious and tends to worry, I'd likely want to research the product further before committing to a purchase.  I wouldn't immediately buy it but would be willing to try it after more investigation.
