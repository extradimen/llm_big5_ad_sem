**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The language feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention:** I would likely *intend to purchase* this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me.  I might even *try* it, but I wouldn't necessarily make an immediate decision to buy it (which is why "consider buying" gets a higher score). 


Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
