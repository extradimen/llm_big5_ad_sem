**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad somewhat appealing ("like" and "good"). It's a simple message that targets common desires (energy and looking good).  However, it doesn't particularly stand out or grab my attention strongly ("interesting" and "attractive").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Since I'm a student on a budget, the ad does pique my interest enough to consider buying it ("consider"). Given my personality traits (talkative, reserved), I might even ask others about their experiences with this drink. It's possible I would try it ("try"), and if I found it genuinely helpful, I'd likely intend to purchase it again ("intend"). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
