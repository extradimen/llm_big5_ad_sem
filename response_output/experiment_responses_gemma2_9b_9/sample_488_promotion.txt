**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is simple and straightforward, I find it somewhat appealing. It promises energy and good looks, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive" in a strong sense. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely purchase this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my desire to maintain a positive appearance and energy level at work.
