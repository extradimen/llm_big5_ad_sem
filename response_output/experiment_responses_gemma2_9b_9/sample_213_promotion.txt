**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims seem common and lack specifics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product based on the ad. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I'd likely need more information about the ingredients, benefits, and perhaps user reviews before making a decision. 


My personality traits influence my response:

* **Reserved and Trusting:** The ad's general claims don't immediately convince me.
* **Helpful and Selfish:** While I care about looking good, I prioritize  practicality over superficial appeal.
* **Nervous and Careful:** I wouldn't jump into buying something new without more research.
