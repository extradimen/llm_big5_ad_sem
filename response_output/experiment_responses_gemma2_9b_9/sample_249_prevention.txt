**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and relies on fear tactics ("look dull") which aren't very appealing to me.  I wouldn't consider it attractive either. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to try the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a specific need for a pick-me-up drink. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
