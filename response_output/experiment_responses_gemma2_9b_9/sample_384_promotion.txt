**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appealing to a desire for energy and appearance enhancement, it lacks originality. I find it interesting enough but not particularly good or attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product as I value feeling energized and looking my best. However, I would probably try it first before fully committing to a regular purchase. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these scores!
