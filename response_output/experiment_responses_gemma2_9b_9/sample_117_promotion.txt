**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of "staying energized and looking your best" appealing due to my desire to be helpful and my original nature (I want to feel good and present my best self), I don't find it particularly unique or groundbreaking. It's a common theme in advertising.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product, but not immediately purchase it. My high income allows for some experimentation, and  the promise of feeling energized and looking good is tempting. However, I would need more information about the ingredients and potential side effects before committing to a purchase. My tendency to be cautious (agreeing that I get nervous easily) might also make me hesitant.
