**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it without more information about its contents and benefits.  I'd definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
