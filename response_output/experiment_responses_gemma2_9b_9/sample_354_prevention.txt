**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it plays on my worry about looking dull.  
    * While it's not necessarily a **good (2)** ad due to its somewhat manipulative nature, it does grab attention.
    * I don't find the ad particularly **attractive (1)** as it relies on fear rather than appealing to my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend (1)** to purchase this product because the promise of feeling less tired and looking better aligns with my desire to project a positive image. 
    * I would also **try (1)** it out of curiosity, especially if it's promoted heavily.
    *  However, I'd **consider (3)** buying it based on factors like price and reviews, as I'm not easily swayed by advertising alone.
