} 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The message is straightforward and plays on desires for energy and looking good â€“ things that can be relevant to someone in my demographic. However, it lacks a strong unique selling point or compelling storytelling.

* **Purchase Intention:** While I like the general idea, I'm not immediately rushing to buy.  I'd likely try the product (score 2) because I tend to be open to new things and enjoy socializing. I might even consider purchasing it regularly if it genuinely delivered on its promises and fit my lifestyle (score 3). But, I wouldn't intend to buy it without further research or seeing testimonials from others.
