**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing. The promise of energy and looking good is attractive, but it's not particularly unique or groundbreaking. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the ad, my intention to buy depends on other factors like price, availability, and personal preference for similar products. I would likely try it at least once based on the ad alone.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
