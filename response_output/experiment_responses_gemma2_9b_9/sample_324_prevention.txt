**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and somewhat intriguing, I find it lacking in creativity and relying on common fear-based tactics. The claim about feeling "dull" is subjective and doesn't offer concrete benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it outright without further information about its ingredients, potential side effects, and real user experiences.
