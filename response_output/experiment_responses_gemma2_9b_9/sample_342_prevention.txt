**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not completely sold on the ad, it does pique my interest. The idea of feeling tired and looking dull is something I can relate to, so the ad gets a few "2s" (interesting/average) across the board.  I don't find it particularly appealing or well-crafted, though.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad speaks to a common concern, I'm likely to at least try this drink. The score of "1" indicates I intend to purchase it, but it wouldn't be a top priority. 


I tend to be trusting and like trying new things, but I also worry about wasting money. The ad needs more convincing before I'd wholeheartedly commit to buying.
