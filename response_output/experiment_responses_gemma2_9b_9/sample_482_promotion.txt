**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting (I'm not sure what "look your best" even means in this context), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims about energy and appearance seem vague and unrealistic.  

My score for purchase intention reflects that while I might *consider* buying the product out of curiosity, I'm unlikely to actively try it or intend to make a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
