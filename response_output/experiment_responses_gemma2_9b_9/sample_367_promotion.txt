Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is straightforward and uses appealing language ("energized," "look your best"), I find it a bit generic. It doesn't stand out as particularly creative or unique.  

* **Purchase Intention:**  I *like* the idea of feeling energized, but I'm cautious about products promising quick fixes. I'd probably try the drink if I saw it on sale or someone recommended it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.   



As a civil servant focused on my work and with a bit of anxiety, I'm more likely to be drawn to products that offer proven benefits or address specific concerns rather than general promises.
