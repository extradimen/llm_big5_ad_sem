**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* on a surface level, I'm not particularly drawn to it. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with my priorities at this stage in life.  I wouldn't call it *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to *intend* and *try* the product because I'm always open to trying new things, especially if they promise energy boosts. However,  "consider buying" reflects a degree of reservation. The claim lacks specific details about ingredients or benefits, which would influence my final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
