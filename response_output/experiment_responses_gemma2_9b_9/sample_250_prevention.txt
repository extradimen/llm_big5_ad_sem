**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. However, I don't find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit oversimplified.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  I tend to be cautious and worry a lot, so I'd likely research other options or natural remedies before making a purchase.
