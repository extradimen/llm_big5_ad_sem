**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like:**  The ad is a bit attention-grabbing due to its straightforward warning.  I wouldn't say I *like* it, but it's noticeable.
    * **Interesting:** The promise of avoiding tiredness and dullness is intriguing enough to make me pause and consider it. 
    * **Good:** It's a simple ad that gets the point across. Not necessarily "good" in terms of creativity, but effective in its basic message.
    * **Attractive:**  I wouldn't call it attractive. The wording feels a bit generic and lacks anything particularly appealing.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend:** I might actually buy this drink just to see if it works. My "nervous" nature often leads me to try things out of a desire to feel better or more in control.
    * **Try:** Definitely willing to give it a shot, especially if it's affordable. 
    * **Consider:** I wouldn't actively seek this drink out, but if it was conveniently available and I felt tired/dull, I'd probably consider buying it.
