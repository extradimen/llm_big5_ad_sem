**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's somewhat good (2), I don't personally like it (2) or find it particularly attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): Because of my tendency to worry (Agree) and be nervous easily (Agree), the promise of feeling less tired and looking less dull is appealing. 
    * I will try to buy this product (1): My talkative nature (Strongly Agree) might lead me to ask friends about their experience with this drink.  
    * I will consider buying this product (2): My carelessness (Strongly Agree) means I'm not overly focused on making informed decisions, so I'd likely give it a try if it was easily accessible.
