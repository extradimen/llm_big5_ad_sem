**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit manipulative to me, using fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") as a selling point.  I'm also not drawn to its aesthetics. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I would consider trying the product. The idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
