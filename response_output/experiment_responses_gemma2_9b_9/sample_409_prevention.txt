  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's message about tiredness and dullness resonates with me as someone who values productivity and appearing well-presented. This leads to a willingness to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and price. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
