**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (being energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention as something groundbreaking. I think it's decent and attractive in its simplicity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** As someone who values originality and tends to be careless, a generic "energizing" drink wouldn't necessarily jump out at me. However, the ad sparks curiosity enough that I might try it once or consider buying it if there's a compelling promotion or if friends recommend it.
