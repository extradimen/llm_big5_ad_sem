Here's why:

* **Ad Appeal:** The ad is simple and straightforward. While not particularly groundbreaking, it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are things I value. 

* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" resonates with me.  I'm likely to try the product, especially since I am a managerial employee and need to appear energetic and put-together.  However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without further information about ingredients and effectiveness.
