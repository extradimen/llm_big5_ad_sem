**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's a decent attempt to convey its message, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and plays on anxieties about appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am somewhat likely to try this product because the ad raises a concern I might have (feeling tired and dull). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately and would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision. 


My personality traits, like being reserved and trusting but also prone to worry, influence my response. The ad preys on my tendency to worry about appearing tired and dull, which makes me more susceptible to trying the product. However, my careful nature means I wouldn't jump into a purchase without further research.
