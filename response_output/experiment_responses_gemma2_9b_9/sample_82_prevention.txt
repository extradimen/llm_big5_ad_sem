**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The message itself makes me think about my energy levels, which worries me because I already tend to get nervous and worry a lot. This could push me towards trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright.  I'd probably consider it depending on other factors like price and recommendations.
