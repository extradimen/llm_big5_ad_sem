**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly captivating, the ad's simplicity and straightforward message are mildly appealing.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and improved appearance is something that might grab my attention.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across effectively, but lacks any real depth or creativity.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's visuals and overall presentation aren't particularly eye-catching or memorable. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might be inclined to try the product based on the ad alone, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
    * **Try (1):**  I'm more likely to sample it if given the opportunity or see it recommended by someone trustworthy.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price is reasonable and I happen to need an energy boost, I'd definitely consider purchasing it.



My personality traits, such as being reserved and thorough, might lead me to research more about the product and its ingredients before making a decision.  The ad's vague claims about "looking your best" don't hold much weight with my preference for factual information.
