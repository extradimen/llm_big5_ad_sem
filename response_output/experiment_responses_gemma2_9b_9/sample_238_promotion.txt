  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language is generic and doesn't really stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I *would* consider trying this product. The promise of energy and looking my best appeals to me, even if the ad itself isn't captivating. However, I'm not yet ready to commit to purchasing it outright.
