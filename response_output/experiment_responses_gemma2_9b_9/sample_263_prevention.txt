**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle is a bit manipulative, playing on my worry (which I admit runs high) without offering much substance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product based on the ad alone because of my tendency to worry. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it immediately. I'd likely research more about the product and its claims before making a decision.
