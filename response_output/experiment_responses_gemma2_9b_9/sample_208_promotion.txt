**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel like I *need* this drink.  I worry a lot and might be susceptible to marketing claims, so I'd consider buying it if I saw it in the store and was craving something. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.
