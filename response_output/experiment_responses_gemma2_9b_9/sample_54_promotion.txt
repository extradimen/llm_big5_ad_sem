**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and understandable (interesting), I don't personally connect with it. The claims of "stay energized" and "look your best" feel generic and don't resonate with my priorities.  I wouldn't call it attractive or particularly good.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad,  I might try the product out of curiosity (intend to purchase/try). However, I wouldn't make a conscious decision to buy it based solely on this advertisement. There would need to be more compelling factors like personal recommendations or specific benefits tailored to my needs.
