**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language used ("tired and dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on anxieties rather than offering a genuine benefit.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't be eager to purchase it outright. I'd probably want more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a decision. The "prevention" aspect of the ad appeals to my desire for stability and avoiding negative outcomes (feeling tired or dull), but I am cautious about products that make bold claims without evidence.
