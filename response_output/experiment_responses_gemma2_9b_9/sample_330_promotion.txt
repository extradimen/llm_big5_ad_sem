  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is not particularly captivating (hence the lower "attractive" score), it's clear and conveys a message I can understand. It piques my curiosity enough to be interesting. 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad appeals to the desire for feeling energized and looking good, which are things I value. However, as a student with limited income,  I'd likely need more convincing about the product's effectiveness before committing to buying it (hence the "consider" score).  I might try it if it was on sale or offered as a sample. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
