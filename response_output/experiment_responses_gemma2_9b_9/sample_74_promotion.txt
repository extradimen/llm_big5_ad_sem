**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not particularly exciting, the ad is clear and gets its message across. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is relatable, but it's a common theme in many advertisements. 
    * **Good (2):** It's well-constructed and conveys its intended message effectively. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't stand out visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider purchasing this product if it was recommended by someone I trust or had positive reviews.
    * **Try (1):** I'm open to trying new things, but I'd likely need a good reason or incentive.
    * **Consider (3):**  The ad makes me somewhat curious about the product, so I might look into it further if I saw it again or encountered more information about it.




As someone who values thoroughness and trustworthiness, general claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" don't immediately resonate with me. I would need to see more specific details and evidence before seriously considering purchasing this product.
