**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message clear and appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. It's not groundbreaking or unique. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product because the claims resonate with my desire to appear well-kept, but I wouldn't rush out to purchase it immediately. I'd probably try it if offered a sample or see reviews from others before committing.
