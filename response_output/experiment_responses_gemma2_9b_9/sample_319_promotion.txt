**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting. It's not something that grabs my attention immediately, but it's not bad either.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, especially since I worry a lot about how I come across.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple message that gets the point across. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't really stand out visually or creatively.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually buy this drink because I'm looking for ways to feel more confident and energized.
    * **Try (1):** I'd definitely be willing to try it at least once to see if it lives up to the claims.
    * **Consider (2):** If I saw a good deal or positive reviews, I would seriously consider making this a regular purchase.
