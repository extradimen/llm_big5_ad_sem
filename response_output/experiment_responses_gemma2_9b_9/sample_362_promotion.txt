**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (score of 3 for "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or inspire strong feelings. The use of  general claims like "stay energized" and "look your best" feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed, I might be inclined to try this drink (score of 1 for "intend to purchase"). My personality leans towards trying new things, and the promise of energy could be appealing. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly (score of 3 for "consider"). My carelessness and tendency to make impulsive decisions mean I might buy it on a whim, but my preference for emotional stability would likely lead me to re-evaluate if it didn't deliver on its claims.
