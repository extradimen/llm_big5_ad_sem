**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and attractive. While it's not particularly groundbreaking, the message is clear and concise. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product based on the ad. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it right away without further research or trying a sample. 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
