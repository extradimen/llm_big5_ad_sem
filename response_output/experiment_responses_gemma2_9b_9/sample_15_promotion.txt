**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad attractive and interesting, it's not something that I strongly connect with. The "stay energized" aspect might appeal to me because of my managerial role, but  I don't place high importance on looking my "best".
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would definitely intend to purchase this product and likely try it out. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it long-term without knowing more about the ingredients and its effectiveness.
