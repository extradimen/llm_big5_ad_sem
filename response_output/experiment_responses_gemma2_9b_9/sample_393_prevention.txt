I find the ad interesting enough, as it plays on a common concern about energy and appearance. I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising, but not particularly attractive. While I might consider buying the product based on the ad, I wouldn't be rushing out to purchase it right away.  The ad does make me think about trying it though.
