**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message relatable (staying energized and looking good), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims feel generic and not strongly persuasive. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to potentially try the product, especially since I value feeling energetic. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out without more specific information about its ingredients or benefits.
