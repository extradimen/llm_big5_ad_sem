**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language is a bit generic and doesn't really grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product because I worry a lot about looking my best, but I also want to *try* it before committing fully.  I will *consider* buying it based on other factors like price and reviews, as well as whether or not I see people who look like me using the product successfully. 


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation of any specific score!
