**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* (2) in its simplicity, it doesn't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which isn't particularly appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might *try* the product (1) or even *intend* to purchase it if I saw a good deal or had a specific need (1). However,  I wouldn't actively *consider* buying this product based solely on this ad. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients, benefits, and reviews before making a decision.
