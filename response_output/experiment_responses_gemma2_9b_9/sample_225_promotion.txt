**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive.  The message is straightforward but not particularly captivating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of staying energized and looking your best appeals to me as someone who values efficiency and maintaining a good appearance. This leads me to consider purchasing the product, even though I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it.  I would likely try it first before making a commitment to regular purchases.
