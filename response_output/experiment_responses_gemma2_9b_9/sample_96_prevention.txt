**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a somewhat relatable concern (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't personally find it particularly appealing or attractive. The claim feels a bit general and lacks specifics about what makes the drink effective.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product because I'm generally trusting and open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make a strong effort to find it. My worry about feeling tired and looking dull isn't strong enough to drive me to buy based on this ad alone.
