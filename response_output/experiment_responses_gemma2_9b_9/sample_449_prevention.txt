**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I wouldn't call it "likeable" or "attractive." It feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about looking dull. I find it interesting because it directly addresses a common concern, though.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (reserved, distrustful, emotionally stable), I'm hesitant to jump into buying something based solely on an ad. However, the idea of feeling less tired and "dull" does appeal to me slightly. It's possible that if I saw this ad repeatedly or in a context where I was already considering energy drinks, I might be more likely to try it (score 1 for "try").  It wouldn't be my first choice, though, so "consider" is a more accurate score overall.
