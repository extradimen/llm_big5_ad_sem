Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit clich√© and plays on common insecurities about looking tired or dull. The "without this drink" approach also comes across as slightly manipulative.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:**  
    * **Intend to purchase:** I might be persuaded to try the drink because of the potential benefit (looking less tired and more vibrant). However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it right away without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. 
    * **Try to buy:** This is a likely scenario.  I'm generally curious about new products, especially if they promise a quick improvement in appearance. 
    * **Consider buying:** Even if the initial try doesn't convince me, I might consider buying it again if it genuinely delivers on its promise and becomes part of my regular routine.
