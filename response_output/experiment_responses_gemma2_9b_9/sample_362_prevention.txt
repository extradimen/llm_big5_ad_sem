**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "dull" aspect feels a bit shallow and relies on fear-mongering.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to try this product due to its claim of combating tiredness, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I would likely consider buying it if it was offered at a good price or if I had a particularly demanding day/week. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of these points!
