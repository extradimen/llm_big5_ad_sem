**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's attractive. The message is a bit generic and relies on fear tactics which I'm not always swayed by. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me more likely to try the product. I'm curious about what it offers and how it could potentially combat tiredness and dullness, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone. I'd probably want to see more information about the ingredients, reviews, or maybe even try a sample before committing to a full purchase.
