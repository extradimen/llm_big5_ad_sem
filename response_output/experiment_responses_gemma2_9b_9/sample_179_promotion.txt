**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing, so I might *intend* to purchase this product or at least *try* it. However, I wouldn't necessarily make it a priority buy without more specific information about the drink's ingredients and benefits. 


My personality traits like being careful, worrying a lot, and preferring not to be talked into things influence my response. I'd need more convincing before committing to a purchase.
