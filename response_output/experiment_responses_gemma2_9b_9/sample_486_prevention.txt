**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward and gets its message across, I wouldn't say I "like" it. It's not particularly creative or memorable.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is something that might catch my attention because everyone wants to feel energetic and look their best. 
    * **Good (2):** The ad effectively uses fear-based language ("Without this drink...") to appeal to a desire for a desired outcome (feeling energized and vibrant). However, it lacks depth and doesn't provide any specific details about the product itself.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't find this ad particularly attractive. The simplicity and lack of visual appeal don't grab my interest.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am unlikely to immediately purchase this product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):**  I might be willing to try the product if I saw it in a store or heard more positive reviews, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price was reasonable and the product had some appealing features beyond just claiming to prevent tiredness, I would consider buying it.
