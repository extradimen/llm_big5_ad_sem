**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's focus on energy and appearance aligns with a desire to maintain vitality as one ages.  I am likely to try the product, but wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I might also consider buying it based on recommendations or if it becomes readily available.
