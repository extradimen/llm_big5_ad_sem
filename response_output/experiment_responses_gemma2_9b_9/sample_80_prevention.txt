**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, it doesn't quite reach a "good" level for me. It plays on insecurity ("tired," "dull") which I tend to dismiss.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad's tactics, I'd likely try the product. The promise of feeling less tired and looking better appeals to me, even if I find the ad a bit manipulative.
