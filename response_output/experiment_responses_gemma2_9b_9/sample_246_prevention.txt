**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it attractive. The "prevention" angle plays on my anxiety (getting nervous easily, worrying a lot), but I'm not immediately convinced by the claims.  I might try the product out of curiosity or if there was a good deal, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
