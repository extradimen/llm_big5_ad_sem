**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The "dull" imagery isn't very strong, and I wouldn't say I like it.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product because the ad plays on a common worry about looking tired. However, I'm not immediately inclined to purchase it. I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
