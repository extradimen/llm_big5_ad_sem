Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad *interesting* because it speaks to common desires for energy and looking good. While I don't personally find it *attractive* or *good*,  it does get my attention.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to *intend* and *try* this product based on the promise of increased energy. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a top choice without more information about ingredients and potential side effects.  My personality traits indicate I value thoroughness (strongly agree) and tend to be careless (agree), so I'd likely research before committing fully.
