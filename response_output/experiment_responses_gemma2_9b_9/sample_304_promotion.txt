**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I wouldn't say I *like* the ad. It's not particularly engaging or memorable to me. However, I find it mildly interesting because it promises something that could be useful (energy and looking good). I don't believe it's a good ad overall, and I don't find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad doesn't grab my attention, the promise of feeling energized and looking better is somewhat appealing.  I wouldn't *intend* to buy it or *try* it right away, but I might *consider* buying it if I was looking for a drink like that or saw it on sale. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
