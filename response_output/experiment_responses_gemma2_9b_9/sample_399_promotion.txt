**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that's relevant to my age group. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or unique.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the idea, I'm not sure if I'd *immediately* buy it. I might try it if I saw it on sale or heard good reviews from friends (as I tend to be helpful and unselfish with others).  I'd definitely consider buying it if it became a part of my routine for work.
