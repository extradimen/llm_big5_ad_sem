**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the ad uses fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), I find it somewhat interesting (4) because it appeals to my desire to appear energetic and vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily call it "good" (2) or "attractive" (2). It feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product (1) and potentially purchase it (1) based on its claim of boosting energy and appearance. However, I wouldn't commit to buying it without further research or considering alternatives.  I'd want to learn more about the ingredients and potential side effects before making a final decision (3).
