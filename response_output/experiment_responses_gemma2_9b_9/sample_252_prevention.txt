This ad uses fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which I find a little manipulative. While it's interesting because it plays on common anxieties, I don't find it particularly attractive or believe it's truly effective.  I might consider buying the product if there was more to persuade me besides the fear of looking dull.
