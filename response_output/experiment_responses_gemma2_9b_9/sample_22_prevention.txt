This ad doesn't really appeal to me. The language feels a bit too hyperbolic and manipulative. While I understand the intention is to create a sense of urgency, it comes across as insincere. However, I might consider trying the product if it was recommended by someone I trust or if I happened to be in need of a pick-me-up.
