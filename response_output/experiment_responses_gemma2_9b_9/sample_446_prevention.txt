**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics rather than appealing to my values. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my insecurities (feeling tired and looking dull) and I tend to worry a lot, I might *intend* to buy the product or at least *try* it out of a desire to feel better. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* buying it regularly without more convincing information about its benefits.
