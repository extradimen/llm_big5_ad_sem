**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which doesn't appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad, I might consider buying this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.
