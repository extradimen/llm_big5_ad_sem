**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and attractive. The message is clear and plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. While I don't think it's a *great* ad, it certainly grabs attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product. While I don't *intend* to buy it immediately, the ad makes me curious enough to consider it. The "without this drink" phrasing suggests a definite benefit, and as someone who values doing a thorough job (and looking good!), I might be willing to give it a shot.  


**Note:** My personality traits, particularly my outgoing nature and tendency to be original, might make me more receptive to advertising that plays on social desirability and self-improvement.
