**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. It's a common type of advertisement.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely intend to purchase this product and might even try it based on the ad's claim of increased energy and better appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without further research or seeing if others have had positive experiences with it.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
