**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I "like" it. The language used ("tired," "dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

My purchase intention is influenced by this. While I might try the product out of curiosity (score 1 for "try"), I'm not committed to buying it outright (score 1 for "intend"). I would definitely consider purchasing it if I were experiencing fatigue or saw positive reviews, which is reflected in the score of 3 for "consider".
