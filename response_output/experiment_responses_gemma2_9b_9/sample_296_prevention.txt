**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    *  **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward and uses a common appeal to emotions (feeling tired and looking dull), it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it somewhat interesting but not something I would actively seek out.
    * **Interesting (3):** The concept of feeling tired and looking dull due to lack of something is relatable, even if the solution isn't immediately clear.  
    * **Good (2):** It gets its point across effectively, using simple language and imagery. However, it lacks any real depth or originality. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not immediately inclined to buy this product based on the ad alone. I need more information about the drink itself and its benefits.
    * **Try (1):** The ad might make me consider trying it if I see it in a store and am feeling particularly tired or self-conscious. 
    * **Consider (2):**  If the product had a strong recommendation from someone I trust, or if I were facing a specific problem that the ad claimed to solve, I might be more likely to consider buying it.
