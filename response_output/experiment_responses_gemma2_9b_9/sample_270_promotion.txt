**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to my desire to look good and feel energized. The language is positive and straightforward. However, I don't find it groundbreaking or particularly creative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. While I wouldn't say I *intend* to buy it right away, the promise of looking my best and staying energized is appealing. I'd probably consider it if I saw it in the store or needed a pick-me-up.
