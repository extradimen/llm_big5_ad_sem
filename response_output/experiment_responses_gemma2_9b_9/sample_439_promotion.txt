**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims about energy and looking your best aren't very compelling to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *might* try this product. The claim of staying energized is something that appeals to me as a busy office worker. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. I'd definitely consider buying it if there was a promotion or if someone recommended it to me. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
