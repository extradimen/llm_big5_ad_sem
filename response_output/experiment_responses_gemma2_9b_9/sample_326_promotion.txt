**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I wouldn't describe it as something I "like." The claims about energy and appearance are vague and don't particularly resonate with me.  

My purchase intention is somewhat influenced by a desire to feel energized, but I would need more information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before committing to buying it.  I might try it if it was readily available and affordable, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
