Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and attractive, but not necessarily something I'd rave about. It's a fairly common type of advertisement that plays on aspirations for energy and appearance. The simplicity of the message is appealing.

* **Purchase Intention:** While I find the ad decent,  my intention to buy this product leans towards trying it out. I wouldn't automatically purchase it based solely on this ad, but I might be tempted to give it a shot if given the opportunity. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or consider it a necessity.
