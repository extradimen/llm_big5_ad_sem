**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry and be easily nervous, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is concerning to me. This might make me *intend* to try the product and even *consider* buying it long-term. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to purchase it right away.  I'd probably want to research more about the drink and its ingredients first.
