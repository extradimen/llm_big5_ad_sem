**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* because it presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't personally find it *attractive*  or particularly *like* it. The language feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("Without this drink...").

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me. I might be tempted to *try* the product to see if it helps alleviate those anxieties. However, I'm not immediately ready to *intend* to buy it. I need more information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects before committing.  The ad itself doesn't provide enough for me to confidently *consider* buying it.
