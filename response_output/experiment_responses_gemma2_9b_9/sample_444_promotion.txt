**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language is generic and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product. I get nervous easily and worry a lot, so the promise of feeling energized might appeal to me, even though I'm generally distrustful and not one for following trends. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without more specific information about the drink's ingredients and benefits.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
