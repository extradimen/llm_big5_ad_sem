**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally connect with it. The claims feel generic and don't resonate with my need for specific benefits or solutions.  The "look your best" part feels superficial and doesn't appeal to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the above, while I might consider buying this product if there was a strong promotion or if I was in need of an energy boost, I wouldn't actively seek it out. I tend to be cautious and prefer products with more specific claims.
