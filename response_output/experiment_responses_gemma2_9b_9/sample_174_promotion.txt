**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it doesn't quite grab my attention as "good" or "attractive." It feels somewhat generic.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone who is generally trusting and helpful, I might be swayed to try this product based on the advertisement. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about its ingredients and benefits.  I would definitely consider buying it after researching further.
