**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at persuasion, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The "look dull" phrasing feels a bit manipulative to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase:** This drink sounds like something that might help with my energy levels, and I do get nervous easily. The ad plays on those insecurities, making me more likely to try it.
    * **Try to buy:** I'm not going to make a beeline for this product, but if I see it at the store, I'll probably pick it up and give it a shot.
    * **Consider buying:**  I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this drink, especially if there are cheaper alternatives. The ad has piqued my curiosity, but I need to see more before committing.
