**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly appeal to me. I find the message fairly common and don't feel a strong emotional connection to it.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of a drink for energy and looking good is intriguing enough to hold my attention. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the basic message across clearly, but lacks anything unique or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design or imagery doesn't particularly draw me in.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't actively seek out this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** If I happened to see it at a store and was curious, I might give it a try. 
    * **Consider (3):**  If there were other compelling factors like a friend's recommendation or a special offer, I might be more inclined to buy it.



**My Personality Influences:**

My reserved nature and tendency to be distrustful mean I'm less likely to be swayed by advertising that makes bold claims. My focus on being emotionally stable and original suggests I might prioritize products that appeal to my sense of individuality rather than ones promising superficial benefits like "looking your best."
