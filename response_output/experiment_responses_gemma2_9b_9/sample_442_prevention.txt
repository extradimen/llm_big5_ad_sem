**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good at conveying a message, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because the advertisement appeals to my desire to be perceived as energetic and successful. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further information about its effectiveness and ingredients.
