**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it promises a benefit (energy and looking good) that many people desire. However, I'm not particularly drawn to it (2). It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out.
    *  I don't find it *attractive* (1) or believe it's inherently *good* (2) because the claims seem vague and unspecific. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I might *intend to purchase* (1) this product if I saw it on sale or in a convenient location.  
    *  I would definitely *try* (1) it based on curiosity, especially if there was a free sample available.
    *  I'm willing to *consider* buying (3) it if I had a positive experience with a similar product in the past or if I saw compelling testimonials from people I trust.



As someone who is reserved and sometimes rude but also helpful and original, I'm unlikely to be swayed by traditional advertising appeals. I need more specific information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
