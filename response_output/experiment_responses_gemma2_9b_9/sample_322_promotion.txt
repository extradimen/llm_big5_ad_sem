{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [2, 3, 2, 1],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The messaging is fairly common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough by the promise of energy and looking my best to consider purchasing the product. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  


Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of my reasoning!
