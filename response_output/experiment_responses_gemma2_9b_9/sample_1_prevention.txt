**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it plays on my concern about looking dull (agree with "I worry a lot"). The language is simple and direct, which I tend to appreciate. However, I don't find it particularly creative or groundbreaking.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest and I might try the product, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it right away. I'm more likely to consider buying it after trying it or seeing positive reviews from others. My tendency to be careless (agree with "I tend to be careless") might make me less inclined to commit to a purchase without further research.
