**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad visually appealing (attractive) and interesting, I don't necessarily think it's a *good* advertisement. The claims about looking your best and staying energized feel a bit generic and overused. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I tend to be talkative and outgoing, I might be influenced by seeing others drink this product or discussing it with friends. This could lead me to try it (try) or even intend to purchase it (intend). However, I'm also cautious and reserved, so I'd definitely consider the product and its ingredients before making a final decision (consider).
