**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing ("stay energized and look your best"), it lacks something to truly grab my attention. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out as particularly creative or unique. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily make a purchase decision based solely on this advertisement. I would need to see more information about the product's ingredients, potential benefits, and perhaps some customer reviews before committing to buying it.
