**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than appealing to genuine needs or desires. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a firm purchase decision right away. However, if I were already in need of a beverage and saw this product, I might consider it. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
