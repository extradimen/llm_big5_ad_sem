**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't appeal to me personally. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately.  I would consider buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and specific ingredients. My personality traits suggest I'm cautious and reserved, so a one-time trial would be more likely than a full commitment based solely on this ad.
