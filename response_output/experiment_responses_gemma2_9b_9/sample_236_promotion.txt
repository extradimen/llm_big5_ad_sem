**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent and interesting. The message is straightforward and appealing to someone who values productivity and appearance. However, it's not particularly captivating or groundbreaking in its presentation.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad appealing enough, my personality suggests a cautious approach to new products. 

    * **Intend to Purchase:** I am likely to purchase this product because it aligns with my desire to maintain energy and appearance.
    * **Try:** This is a high score because I'm more likely to try a new drink if it promises those benefits, especially if it's recommended by someone trustworthy.
    * **Consider:**  It's not a top priority purchase for me, so I would consider buying it only if other factors align (e.g., a good deal, being out of my usual drink).
