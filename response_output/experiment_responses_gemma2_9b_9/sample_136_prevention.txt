**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't necessarily "like" it or find it particularly attractive. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product, especially if I was feeling particularly tired or self-conscious. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or be fully committed to purchasing it based solely on this advertisement.
