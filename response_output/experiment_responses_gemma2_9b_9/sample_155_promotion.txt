  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 2]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad message fairly straightforward and understandable, it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels a bit generic. I'm not sure "look your best" is a strong enough selling point for me personally.  
* **Purchase Intention:** The claim of staying energized is appealing, as someone who gets nervous easily, I could use a boost sometimes. However, I'd likely try it before committing to purchasing it regularly.  


My personality traits suggest that while I might be open to trying new things, I also tend to be cautious and reserved. A strong marketing campaign with more specific benefits would likely sway my decision further.
