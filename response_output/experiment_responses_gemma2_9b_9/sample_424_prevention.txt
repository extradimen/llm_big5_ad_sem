**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a surface level, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The language is quite common and lacks something that would make me truly "like" or find it "attractive".
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about potentially trying the product. Because I get nervous easily, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull isn't appealing. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it right away. I would likely consider it based on further information like reviews or personal recommendations before making a decision.
