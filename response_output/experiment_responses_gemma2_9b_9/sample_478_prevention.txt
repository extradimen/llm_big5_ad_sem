**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *like*able or *attractive*. The language used feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I find the ad interesting and potentially persuasive, I might *intend* to purchase this product if I needed an energy boost. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *try* to buy it immediately. I would likely *consider* buying it depending on other factors like price, reviews, and availability of healthier alternatives.
