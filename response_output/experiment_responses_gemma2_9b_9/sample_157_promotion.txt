**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting due to its straightforward promise of benefits, I wouldn't say it's exceptionally good or attractive. The language is a bit generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm leaning towards trying this product. The claim of increased energy and improved appearance are relevant to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. A trial run seems like the best approach. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
