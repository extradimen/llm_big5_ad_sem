  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad isn't particularly *appealing* to me (1), I find it *interesting* (3) because it promises benefits related to energy and appearance â€“ things that are relevant to my life as a civil servant.  I think it's a *decent* ad overall (2).
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does make me somewhat likely to *intend* (1) to purchase the product and *try* (1) it at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it regularly without more information about its ingredients, potential side effects, and actual effectiveness. 


As a cautious person who worries a lot, I need more convincing than just an ad claiming these benefits.
