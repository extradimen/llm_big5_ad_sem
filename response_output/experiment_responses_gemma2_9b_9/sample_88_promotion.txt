**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and appealing ("energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims are common to many similar products, so it doesn't stand out as particularly unique or creative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product due to the promise of feeling energized. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it without more information about its ingredients and effectiveness compared to other options.
