**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is clear and appeals to a desire for energy and good looks, I find it somewhat generic. It doesn't offer anything particularly unique or compelling.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad might make me consider trying the product because everyone wants to feel energized and look their best. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately or even actively seek it out. My nervousness and tendency to be cautious would likely lead to further research before making a purchase.
