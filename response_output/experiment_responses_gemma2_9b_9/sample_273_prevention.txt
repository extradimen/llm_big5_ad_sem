**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on my worry about looking dull. However, I wouldn't say I "like" it.
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad's message about feeling tired and looking dull resonates with me because of my worries. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a simple, straightforward message, but I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to try the product because of my concern about looking tired and dull. 
    * **Try (1):** I'm more inclined to give it a try than make a full purchase commitment right away.
    * **Consider (2):**  If I find myself frequently feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance, I might consider buying the product regularly.
