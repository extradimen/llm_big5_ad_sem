  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 2, 3]
}
``` 


Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. While not particularly creative, it's not offensive or annoying.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of looking your best and staying energized is appealing to someone like me who values efficiency and appearance. 
    * **Good (4):**  The ad does a decent job of conveying its message clearly. It's concise and uses positive language.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything particularly captivating.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to purchase the product based on the ad alone.  The promise of looking and feeling better is tempting, especially if it aligns with my busy lifestyle. 
    * **Try (2):** I'd definitely be open to trying this drink at least once. 
    * **Consider (3):** The ad has piqued my interest, but I'd need more information about the product before making a firm decision. Factors like price and ingredients would influence my final choice.
