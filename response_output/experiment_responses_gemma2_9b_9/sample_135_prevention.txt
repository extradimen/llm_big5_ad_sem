**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good (I can see how its message might appeal to people), I don't personally like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative and relies on fear rather than presenting genuine benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I intend to purchase this product, as the promise of avoiding fatigue and looking dull is something that could be appealing in my line of work. However, I would likely only try it once before making a final decision about whether it's worth buying regularly.
