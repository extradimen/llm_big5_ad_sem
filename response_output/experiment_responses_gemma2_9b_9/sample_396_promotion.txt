Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not bad. I can see the appeal to some people.
    * **Interesting (3):**  It's simple and gets a point across. 
    * **Good (1):** Not really. It's pretty basic and doesn't stand out much.
    * **Attractive (2):**  The layout is fine, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might actually buy this if I needed a quick energy boost and saw it at the store. 
    * **Try (1):** Yeah, I'd probably give it a shot.
    * **Consider (3):**  I wouldn't actively seek it out, though. There are other drinks I prefer.


**My Reasoning:**

As someone who gets nervous easily and doesn't always make plans, the idea of staying energized might appeal to me. But I'm also cautious and skeptical (sometimes rude!). The ad is simple and straightforward, which doesn't really grab my attention. I need more convincing than just "stay energized and look your best."  I'd probably try it out of curiosity or convenience, but I wouldn't be excited about it.
