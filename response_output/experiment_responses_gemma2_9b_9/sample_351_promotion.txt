**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its simplicity, I wouldn't call it particularly attractive. It relies on common tropes without being particularly unique or memorable.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm likely to try this product due to the promise of increased energy and improved appearance. However, I won't be immediately rushing to buy it. The claim needs further substantiation before I make a firm commitment.
