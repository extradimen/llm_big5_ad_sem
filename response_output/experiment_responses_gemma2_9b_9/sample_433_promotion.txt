**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises both energy and improved appearance, which are things I might be interested in. However, I don't find it particularly "good" or "attractive." It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I like the idea of the product, I would definitely try it. I'm not sure I would immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients and effectiveness. I might consider buying it after trying it first. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
