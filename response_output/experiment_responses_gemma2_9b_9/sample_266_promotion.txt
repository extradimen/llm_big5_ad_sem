**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *appeal* to me aesthetically. The claim of looking your best every day feels superficial and not something that resonates with my values at this stage in life.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am somewhat intrigued by the idea of staying energized, especially considering my student status. While I wouldn't immediately *intend* to buy it, I would likely *try* it if the opportunity arose, and I might even *consider* making it a regular purchase depending on its actual effectiveness and taste.
