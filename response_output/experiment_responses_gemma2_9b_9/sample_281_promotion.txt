**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message somewhat appealing because it speaks to my desire to feel energetic and look good. However, I don't find it particularly creative or attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm generally trusting and like the idea of feeling energized, the ad doesn't provide enough specific information about the product for me to be confident in purchasing it. I might try it if I saw it at the store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
