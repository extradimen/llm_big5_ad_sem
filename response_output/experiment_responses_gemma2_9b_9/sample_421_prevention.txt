  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The "prevention" angle is something that might resonate with me given my age and potential health concerns, but the wording feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. Considering buying it is a possibility if reviews are positive and I feel like I need an energy boost.
