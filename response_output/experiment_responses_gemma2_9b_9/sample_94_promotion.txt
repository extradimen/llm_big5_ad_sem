**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try the product as it aligns with my desire to maintain energy levels. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further information about its ingredients, taste, or reviews. I would definitely consider buying it if a friend recommended it or if there was a compelling promotion. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my response!
