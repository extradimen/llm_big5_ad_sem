**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and plays on insecurities.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I might be swayed by the ad's suggestion that the drink can prevent negative feelings. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it or even try it. I would definitely consider it if others recommended it or if I found myself feeling particularly tired or self-conscious. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
