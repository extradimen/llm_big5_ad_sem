**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is somewhat interesting and decent in its message, I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. It seems fairly generic. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The "look your best" aspect doesn't resonate strongly with me. My focus on being helpful and doing a thorough job likely means I prioritize functional products over those focused solely on appearance.
