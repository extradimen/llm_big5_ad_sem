**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing. Given my tendency to worry and desire a sense of control (doing a thorough job), perhaps this drink could offer a small sense of reassurance and confidence. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it. I'd likely try it once if the opportunity arose, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
