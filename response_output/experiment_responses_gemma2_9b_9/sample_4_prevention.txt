**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am very trusting and helpful,  I might be more inclined to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I would need more information about its ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase.
