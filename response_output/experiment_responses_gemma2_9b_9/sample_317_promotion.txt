**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is fairly generic and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this product because of the "stay energized" aspect, which could be appealing given my work demands. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the ingredients or specific benefits. I'd definitely consider buying it if there was a compelling reason or promotion. 


My personality traits like being reserved and worrying a lot might make me hesitant to jump into trying new things impulsively, hence the lower scores on "intend" and "try."
