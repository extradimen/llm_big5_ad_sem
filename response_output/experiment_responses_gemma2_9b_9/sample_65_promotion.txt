**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think it's exceptionally good.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I like the idea of staying energized, so I'd likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly without more information about its taste, ingredients, and potential side effects.  I'm also cautious and might consider it based on recommendations from friends or reviews.
