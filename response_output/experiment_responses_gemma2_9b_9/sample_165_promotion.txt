**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive. The claims feel generic and don't speak to my specific needs or concerns.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might be inclined to try this product.  I worry a lot about looking my best, and the promise of staying energized appeals to me. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without further research or perhaps seeing testimonials. 


My reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me more cautious about trying new products advertised with broad claims like "look your best every day." I need more concrete information to feel confident in my decision.
