**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises benefits that could be appealing to someone like me. However, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):** The claim of "staying energized and looking your best" is intriguing enough to make me pay attention. 
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad in terms of simplicity and conveying its message. However, it lacks any unique elements that would make it stand out.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually or conceptually appealing to me. It feels generic and doesn't tap into any particular emotions or desires.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product based on the ad alone, but it wouldn't be a top priority.
    * **Try (1):**  I'd likely try it once if given the opportunity, maybe through a sample or promotion.
    * **Consider (3):** If I saw positive reviews or testimonials about the drink, my consideration would increase.  The ad itself doesn't make me eager to buy it.
