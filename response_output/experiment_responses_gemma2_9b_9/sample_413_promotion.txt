**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it promises energy and good looks, which are things I care about. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or clever.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd probably buy this drink, especially if it's reasonably priced and available where I shop.  While I'm interested enough to try it, I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out.


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
