**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its execution (scores of 3 and 2), I don't personally like it or find it particularly attractive (scores of 2 and 1). The language feels a bit manipulative to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider trying this product (score of 3) because the ad plays on my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I'm not actively intending to purchase it (score of 1), nor will I make a strong effort to buy it (score of 1). The ad raises some curiosity, but my reserved nature and tendency to be careless might prevent me from following through with a purchase.
