**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it focuses on benefits that resonate with me â€“ staying energized and looking good. While not groundbreaking, it's a common message that can be effective. I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive," but it gets my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to purchase this product.  The ad piques my interest, and the promise of energy and improved appearance aligns with my desire for self-improvement. I'd probably try it first before committing to a larger purchase. However, I wouldn't automatically buy it without more information about ingredients and effectiveness.
