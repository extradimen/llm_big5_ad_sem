**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and good because it plays on common insecurities about tiredness and appearance. However, I don't find it particularly attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad might make me consider buying this product, I am unlikely to purchase it immediately.  I would probably try it first based on the potential benefit of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
