**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (3) and think it's *good* in its simplicity (2),  I don't personally find it *attractive* (1) or *like* it (2). The language feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurity. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *try* the product (1) out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it (1).  However, depending on the price point and further marketing, I could *consider* buying it (3) if I felt I needed a boost. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
