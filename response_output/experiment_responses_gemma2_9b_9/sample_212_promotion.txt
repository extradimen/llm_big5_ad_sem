**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad isn't particularly *likeable*, it does pique my interest due to its straightforward promise. I wouldn't call it "good" as it lacks specifics, and its attractiveness is average.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (reserved, distrusting, original), I'd be more likely to try the product than outright buy it based on a general claim. However, the ad makes me curious enough to consider it further. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
