**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and conveys its message clearly, it doesn't particularly excite me. I find it interesting enough to read but wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of staying energized and looking your best appeals to my desire for efficiency and effectiveness. Since my income allows for a bit of luxury, I would likely try the product based on this ad. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it without further research or seeing reviews.
