Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I think the ad is interesting and well-made (scores 2 & 3), I don't personally find it *attractive* (score 1).  I'm not easily swayed by claims about looking "your best." 
* **Purchase Intention:** The ad definitely makes me more likely to try the product (scores 2) and potentially buy it (scores 1 & 3). I like making plans and following through, so if this drink actually helps with energy, I'd be willing to give it a shot. However, I wouldn't immediately rush out to purchase it without trying first. 


I tend to be cautious and reserved, so broad claims about "looking your best" don't resonate as strongly with me as something more specific.
