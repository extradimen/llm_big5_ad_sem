**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I think the ad is interesting (3): The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that might appeal to me. 
    * I like the ad (2): While not overly enthusiastic, it's not something I dislike either.
    * I believe the ad is good (2): It gets the point across clearly.
    * I find the ad attractive (1):  It's simple and straightforward, but not particularly eye-catching or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1): I might give it a try.
    * I will try to buy this product (1): Depends on the price and if I see it somewhere convenient.
    * I will consider buying this product (2):  If I'm feeling tired or want a little boost, I might be tempted. 



As someone who values hard work and practicality, claims of looking your best are less important than functional benefits. The ad's simplicity and focus on energy appeal to me, but it doesn't make me strongly want to buy the product immediately.
