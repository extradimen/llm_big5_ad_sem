**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad uses a slightly fear-mongering tactic ("you may feel tired and look dull"), it's presented in a straightforward way that I find somewhat interesting.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The simple message about potential consequences piques my curiosity enough to want to know more about the drink and its benefits. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets the point across clearly, but lacks any real creativity or engaging elements.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad's visual design isn't mentioned, but generally, I find ads like this to be quite unappealing aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy the product based solely on this ad. 
    * **Try (1):**  The ad might make me consider trying the drink if I came across it in a store, perhaps because of curiosity about its claims.
    * **Consider (2):** If the ad was followed by more information about the drink's ingredients, taste, and potential benefits, my consideration level would increase.
