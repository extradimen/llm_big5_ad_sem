Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad fairly attractive and interesting. The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me as a young professional. However, I wouldn't say I *love* it or that it's exceptionally well-made.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While I'm intrigued by the ad, I'm not immediately rushing to buy the product. I'd probably give it a try if I saw it at the store or received a sample. It's definitely on my radar for consideration though. 


My talkative and sociable nature means I enjoy seeing ads that appeal to social trends and aspirations.  The "look your best" aspect is particularly relevant to me, given my age and desire to make a good impression in my professional life.
