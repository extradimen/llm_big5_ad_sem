**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad isn't particularly flashy or engaging, it does pique my curiosity enough to consider it "interesting."  I find the suggestion of feeling tired and dull without the drink somewhat intriguing. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The ad plays on common insecurities about looking good and having energy. This makes it somewhat interesting to me, though not necessarily in a positive way.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple ad that gets its point across. However, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't appeal to my aesthetic preferences.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to try the product based on the ad alone. The promise of combating tiredness and looking dull is appealing enough. 
    * **Try (1):**  Given my personality, I'd probably buy it once just to see if it works. 
    * **Consider (2):** If others recommend it or if I see positive reviews, I might be more inclined to continue buying it.
