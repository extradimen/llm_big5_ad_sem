**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and doesn't actively bother me, it doesn't particularly excite me either. It seems like a common marketing tactic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *do* intend to try this product.  The promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me, especially as someone in a physically demanding job who wants to appear their best. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to purchasing it regularly without trying it first and seeing if it truly delivers on its claims. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
