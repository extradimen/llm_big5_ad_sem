**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I wouldn't necessarily call it *attractive*. The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in ads for drinks like this, so they don't particularly grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I get nervous easily and worry a lot, I might be tempted to try the drink hoping it will help me feel more confident and less anxious. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly until I saw some evidence that it actually worked.  I would definitely *consider* buying it if it was on sale or if I had a reason to need a boost.
