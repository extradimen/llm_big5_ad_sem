**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 (Interesting):** The ad's promise of energy and improved appearance piques my curiosity. 
    * **3 (Good):**  It's a straightforward message that gets the point across clearly.
    * **2 (Like):** While not overly exciting, it's not unpleasant either.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad doesn't visually or emotionally grab me in a way that makes me find it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):**  The ad makes me *think* about trying the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out right now.
    * **1 (Try):** If I saw this drink in a store and was looking for an energy boost, I might give it a shot.
    * **2 (Consider):**  I'm not immediately sold, but I'd be open to trying it under the right circumstances.



My reserved personality means I'm less likely to be swayed by flashy advertising. However, the practical benefit of increased energy and appearance improvement is something that resonates with me on a basic level.
