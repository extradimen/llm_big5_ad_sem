**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad's message simple and direct, which is somewhat interesting to me. However, I wouldn't call it good or attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"). 

* **Purchase Intention:**  While I don't particularly like the ad, the idea of feeling less tired and looking better does appeal to me. It's possible I might consider buying this product if I saw it in a store or heard good things about it from someone I trust.  But, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this ad alone.
