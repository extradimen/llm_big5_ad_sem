**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* in a general sense, it doesn't particularly appeal to me. The language feels a bit generic and lacks the creativity that would make it truly *attractive*. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, my  *consideration* level is higher because I'd need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision. My reserved nature makes me cautious about new products.
