**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it promises a benefit relevant to my demographic - looking good. While I'm not particularly focused on outward appearances, I appreciate practicality and efficiency.
    * The ad is **good (2)** in its simplicity and directness. It clearly conveys its message without being overly complex or gimmicky. 
    *  I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it particularly **attractive (1)**. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it doesn't stand out or spark a strong emotional response from me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase (1)** this product because I value efficiency and being energized throughout the day. This aligns with my need for stamina in my work as an office worker.
    * I will **try (1)** it, primarily due to its claim of energy boost. However, my preference leans towards natural alternatives and I'd likely research further before committing.
    *  I would **consider (3)** buying this product if it receives positive reviews or is recommended by someone I trust. My cautious nature means I need more assurance before making a final decision.
