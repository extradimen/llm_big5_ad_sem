**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* on a surface level, I don't personally find it *attractive*. The "tired and dull" language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention:** Because of my personality (I tend to worry, get nervous easily, and am not generally trusting), I'd be inclined to *try* the product out of a fear of feeling tired and dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it regularly without more convincing evidence about its effectiveness.  I might *consider* buying it again if I felt it genuinely worked, but I wouldn't jump on it immediately.
