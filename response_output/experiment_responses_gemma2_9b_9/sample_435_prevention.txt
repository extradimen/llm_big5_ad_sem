**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which I tend to avoid.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product if I were experiencing fatigue or felt my appearance was lacking. However, the ad itself doesn't strongly influence me to buy it immediately. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
