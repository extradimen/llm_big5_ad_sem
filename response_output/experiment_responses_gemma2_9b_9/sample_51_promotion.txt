**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it particularly *attractive*.  The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit generic and not very compelling to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me curious enough to *try* this drink, and I might even *intend to purchase* it if the price is reasonable and I happen to be in the mood for something new. However, it's not something I would actively *consider* buying on a regular basis.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
