**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and believe it's *good* in its simplicity, I don't personally *like* the way it uses fear to motivate a purchase.  It feels slightly manipulative. It's not particularly *attractive* either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my strong preference for making thorough decisions (agree with "I do a thorough job"), and the ad's reliance on emotional appeal rather than factual information, I wouldn't *intend* to purchase it immediately. However, I might *try* it if I saw other positive reviews or if I was already looking for a similar product. It would definitely be something I would *consider*. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
