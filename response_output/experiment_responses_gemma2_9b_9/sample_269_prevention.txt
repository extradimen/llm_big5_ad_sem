**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull), I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit too simplistic and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting genuine benefits. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and dull is concerning to me. So, I might consider trying this product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away or even try it immediately.  I would likely research other options and read reviews before making a decision.
