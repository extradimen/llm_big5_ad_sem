**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't personally find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad piques my interest enough that I might try the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it.  I would likely consider purchasing it after further research or seeing testimonials. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
