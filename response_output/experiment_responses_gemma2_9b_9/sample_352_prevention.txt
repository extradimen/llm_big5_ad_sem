**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" angle is something I generally respond to as someone who likes to plan and follow through, but the wording feels a bit exaggerated and lacking in specifics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. However, if someone recommended it or I saw positive reviews, I would consider purchasing it. 


The ad plays on my desire for efficiency and effectiveness ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  However, it lacks the detail needed to convince me it's worth trying.
