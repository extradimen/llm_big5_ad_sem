**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message appealing and interesting due to its focus on self-improvement ("look your best"), I'm not convinced by the claim of "staying energized."  It feels a bit generic and lacks specifics. The ad is attractive visually, but not groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'd likely try this product based on the ad alone because it aligns with my desire to take care of myself. However, I wouldn't be immediately committed to purchasing it without further research or information about its ingredients and effectiveness.
