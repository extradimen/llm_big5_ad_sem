**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I like the ad: While not overly captivating, it's straightforward and gets the point across. (3)
    * Interesting:  The promise of staying energized and looking good is something that catches attention. (4)
    * Good: The ad effectively communicates its message. (2) 
    * Attractive:  It's not particularly flashy or visually stimulating, but it's clear and functional. (3)

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Intend to purchase: I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it. (2)
    * Try to buy: If I saw it at the store and was feeling like a boost, I might give it a shot. (1)
    * Consider buying: The ad makes me aware of the product, so if I needed an energy drink or saw positive reviews, I'd consider it. (3) 



**Reasoning:** As someone who values being helpful and practical, and isn't overly swayed by emotional appeals, this ad works on a basic level.  The focus on practicality ("stay energized," "look your best") aligns with my personality. However, the ad lacks any strong personal connection or unique selling point that would make me highly motivated to buy it.
