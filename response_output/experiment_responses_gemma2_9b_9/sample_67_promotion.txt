**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While the message is clear and concise (good), I don't find it particularly appealing or attractive. The claim of "looking your best" feels a bit superficial and doesn't strongly resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I *might* try this product out of curiosity, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. Given my limited income and focus on academics, it wouldn't be a top priority purchase. However, if the opportunity arose (e.g., a free sample), I would consider giving it a try.
