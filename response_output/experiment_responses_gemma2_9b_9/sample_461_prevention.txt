**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I wouldn't say I *like* the ad, it does pique my interest. The idea of feeling tired and dull is something I worry about (hence the "worry a lot" trait), so the ad taps into that fear.  I think it's a decent ad in terms of conveying its message, but not particularly creative or attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my anxiety, I'd probably *intend* to buy this product initially.  I might even *try* it out of curiosity. However, I would definitely *consider* whether it's truly effective and worth the cost before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my responses!
