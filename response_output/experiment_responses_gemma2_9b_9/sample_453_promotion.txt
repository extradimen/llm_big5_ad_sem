**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* or *attract* me. The claims feel a bit generic and don't resonate deeply with my personality.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    *  **Intend to purchase:** Because of my personality traits (careless, worrisome, emotionally unstable), I might impulsively buy the product based on the promise of feeling energized and looking good. 
    * **Try to buy:** This is a more likely scenario due to my tendency to worry about things like appearance. The ad plays on that insecurity.
    * **Consider buying:** Even though I'm not immediately sold, the possibility exists that if I saw this product repeatedly or in a situation where I felt particularly stressed or self-conscious, I might consider purchasing it.
