Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it promises a positive outcome (energy and good looks). However, I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it's inherently "good". The language is common and doesn't stand out to me.
* **Purchase Intention:** 
    *  **Intend:** Because of my personality traits (careless, gets nervous easily, original), I might be intrigued by the idea of a quick fix for energy and appearance.
    * **Try:** The ad doesn't provide specific details about the product or its ingredients, which makes me hesitant to commit fully. 
    * **Consider:**  Ultimately, I would consider buying this product if it was offered at a reasonable price and if I saw positive reviews from people who share my values or concerns (e.g., those who value efficiency and effectiveness).
