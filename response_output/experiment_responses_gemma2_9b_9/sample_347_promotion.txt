**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad message clear and somewhat appealing (hence the "good" and "interesting" scores), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" are common in ads like this and don't stand out to me as unique or particularly compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I worry a lot and tend to be nervous, the idea of a drink that promises energy and improved appearance is somewhat appealing.  I might try it once based on that alone (hence the "try" score), but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. The "consider" score reflects that I'd need more information about the product's ingredients, effects, and reviews before making a firm decision.
