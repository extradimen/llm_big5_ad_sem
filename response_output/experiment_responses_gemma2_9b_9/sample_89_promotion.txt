**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing ("energized and look your best"), it doesn't particularly excite me. The claims feel generic and lack specifics.  I'm not sure if it's "good" in terms of advertising effectiveness, but it's noticeable enough to warrant some attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I *do* intend to purchase this product, at least once, to see if it lives up to its claims. I wouldn't actively seek it out or make it a regular purchase without more convincing information about its ingredients and effectiveness.  I'd likely consider buying it again if I found it genuinely helpful.
