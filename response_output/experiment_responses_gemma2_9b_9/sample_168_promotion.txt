**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad straightforward and somewhat attractive, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of its message. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing, so I would likely try the product. However, without knowing more about the ingredients and effectiveness, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly.  I'd need to see if it lived up to its claims.
