**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (attractive). The message relies on fear ("look dull") which can be manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad sparks my interest enough that I might consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or even make a strong effort to buy it. My worry and tendency to be careful would likely lead to further research before making a decision.
