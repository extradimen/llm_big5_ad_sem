Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I think the ad is interesting and decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I am likely to purchase this drink because I like trying new things, and the promise of "staying energized" appeals to me. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it, and would need to see more information (like ingredients and reviews) before making a final decision. 


Let me know if you want to explore other aspects of this ad or have any more questions!
