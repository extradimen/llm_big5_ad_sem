Let me explain my ratings:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its direct message, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. It relies on fear tactics ("feel tired and look dull") which aren't very persuasive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product out of curiosity since I'm generally trusting. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement. I'd need more information about the drink itself and its ingredients before making a decision.
