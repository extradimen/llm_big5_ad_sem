**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and conveys its message clearly. While not particularly captivating, it's not unpleasant to see.
    * **Interesting (2):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, but the ad doesn't offer much in terms of unique selling points or details. 
    * **Good (4):**  The ad effectively targets its intended audience by focusing on common desires for vitality and appearance.
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad's design and language are straightforward and functional, but not particularly eye-catching or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  The ad sparks my interest enough to consider purchasing the product.
    * **Try (1):** I might be willing to try the drink, especially if there's a promotion or opportunity to sample it.
    * **Consider (3):**  I would likely give the product serious thought based on the ad alone, but further research and reviews would influence my final decision. 


As someone who values honesty and trustworthiness, I would want more information about the ingredients and potential health effects before making a purchase decision.
