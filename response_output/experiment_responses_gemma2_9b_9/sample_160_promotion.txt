**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like or find it attractive. It's a pretty standard energy drink ad.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  As someone working a blue-collar job, I'm always looking for ways to stay energized. I might actually try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it without trying it first and seeing if it lives up to its claims. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
