**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (score of 2), and believe it's decent in its execution (score of 3), I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The scare tactic ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me as strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to worry a lot and am generally careful (as reflected in my personality traits), the ad does make me consider trying this product (score of 3). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score of 1) or even actively try to buy it (score of 1).  I'd likely need more information about the drink's ingredients and potential benefits before making a decision.
