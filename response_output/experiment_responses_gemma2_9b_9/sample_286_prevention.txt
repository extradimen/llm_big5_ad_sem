**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad's message appealing because it plays on my anxiety about appearing dull and tired.  However, the language feels manipulative ("Without this drink...") and I wouldn't consider it particularly well-made.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad preys on my insecurities,  I'm generally distrustful of products that promise quick fixes. I might be tempted to try it once out of curiosity, but I wouldn't intend to make it a regular purchase.
