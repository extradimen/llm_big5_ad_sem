**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is straightforward and clear, it doesn't particularly excite me. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is relevant to someone in my demographic. 
    * **Good (2):** It effectively conveys its message, but lacks any unique or memorable elements.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and messaging aren't particularly appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this product based on the claims alone, especially if I were feeling tired or wanted a boost.
    * **Try (1):**  The ad encourages a trial, so I'd likely give it a go to see if it lives up to its promises.
    * **Consider (2):** Ultimately, my decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and personal preference for similar products. 



As a reserved individual who values reliability over trends, the ad's focus on external appearance wouldn't be a primary motivator.  However, the promise of increased energy could be appealing given my student status and active lifestyle.
