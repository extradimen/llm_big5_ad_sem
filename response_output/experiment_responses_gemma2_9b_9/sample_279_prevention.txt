**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (1) or make me feel strongly about liking it (2).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad's message piques my curiosity enough that I might try this product (1) if I saw it in a store. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out (1). I could consider buying it (3) depending on other factors like price and reviews. 

**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response. As someone reserved but sociable, I'm not easily swayed by emotional appeals. The ad's focus on negative consequences ("tired," "dull") doesn't strongly resonate with me.  I prefer factual information and weigh practical considerations before making a purchase.
