**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it highly attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention:** Because I tend to worry a lot and get nervous easily, claims about staying energized and looking your best appeal to my desire for feeling confident and in control. This, combined with my talkative nature (I like to share new things), makes me likely to try the product and potentially purchase it if I have a positive experience.
