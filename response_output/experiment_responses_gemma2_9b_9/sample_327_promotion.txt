**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, but I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claim of looking your best every day feels a bit superficial for me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I might consider buying this product if I saw it on sale or needed an energy boost, I wouldn't actively seek it out.  The advertisement doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase right away.
