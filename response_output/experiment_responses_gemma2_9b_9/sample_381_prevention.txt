**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "prevention" angle resonates with me a bit because I worry a lot about things going wrong.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  **Intend to purchase:** Since I get nervous easily and worry a lot, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull is concerning. I might be inclined to buy this product if it seemed like a reliable solution to these fears. 
    * **Try to buy:** I'm not immediately rushing to purchase, as I tend to be cautious and do my research before buying things.  

    * **Consider buying:** Given my personality traits, I would definitely consider buying the product if it was affordable and I saw positive reviews from others.
