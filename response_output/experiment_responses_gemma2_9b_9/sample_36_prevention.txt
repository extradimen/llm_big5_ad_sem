**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad interesting (3) and somewhat good (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it.  I wouldn't call it attractive (1).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * The ad's focus on tiredness and dullness might resonate with me on some days, leading me to consider trying the product (3). However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1) or even actively try to buy it (1). 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who is reserved, not very talkative, and tends to be careless, this ad doesn't strongly appeal to me.  The language ("tired" and "dull") feels a bit vague and doesn't directly address any specific concerns I might have. The ad plays on potential insecurities, which I'm generally not receptive to.
