{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 4, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it speaks to values like looking your best and staying energized, which are important in my fast-paced life. The simple message is memorable and easy to understand. However, I don't find it particularly groundbreaking or innovative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I value feeling energized and looking good, I would definitely try this product.  I might even purchase it regularly if it lived up to its claims. But, as a student with financial responsibilities, I would carefully consider the price and effectiveness before committing fully.
