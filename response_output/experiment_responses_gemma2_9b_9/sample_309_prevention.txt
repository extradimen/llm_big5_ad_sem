**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is a common tactic that might resonate with some people, but it doesn't strongly motivate me to purchase the product. However, I might consider trying it if I see it in the store or hear positive reviews from others.
