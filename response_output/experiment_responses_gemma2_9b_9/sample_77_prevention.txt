**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **1 (Dislike):**  While it gets the point across, I don't find the ad particularly appealing. It feels a bit too straightforward and lacks personality.
    * **2 (Interesting):** The concept of feeling tired and looking dull is relatable to someone my age, so it does pique my curiosity.
    * **3 (Good):**  It effectively communicates the potential negative consequences of *not* using their product. 
    * **1 (Not Attractive):** The ad's simplicity doesn't make it visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** Because I worry about feeling tired and looking dull, I might be tempted to try the drink.  
    * **1 (Try):** Given my tendency to trust and my moderate income, I'd likely give it a shot.
    * **2 (Consider):** It depends on other factors like price, availability, and any additional information about the product.
