**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and understandable, I wouldn't say I "like" it or find it particularly "attractive."  I believe it's a decent attempt at conveying a benefit.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my curiosity enough to consider trying the product. However, as someone who is meticulous and does thorough research before making purchases, I wouldn't immediately buy it based on this advertisement alone. I'd likely look for more information about the ingredients, health benefits, and customer reviews before deciding.
