**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." The claims about staying energized and looking your best are common in this type of advertising and don't immediately grab my attention. However,  because I tend to be original and come up with new ideas (and also trust others), I might be intrigued enough to try the product. 


I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away, but I would certainly give it a shot based on the ad.  The "consider" score for purchase intention reflects that there are other factors besides the ad itself that would influence my final decision (like price, reviews, etc.).
