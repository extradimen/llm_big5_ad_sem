**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting because it taps into a common fear (looking dull), I don't particularly like it. The "prevention" angle feels manipulative and a bit too dramatic for my taste. I wouldn't consider it attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

I might try this product based solely on the ad. However,  I'm unlikely to actively purchase it without further research or recommendations.  I'd definitely consider it if someone else vouched for its effectiveness.  



My reserved nature and tendency to be careful mean I wouldn't jump into trying something new based solely on an advertisement. The ad's claim about feeling tired and looking dull doesn't resonate strongly with me, either.
