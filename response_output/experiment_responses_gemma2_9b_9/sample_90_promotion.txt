**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it doesn't quite grab my attention in a way that makes me think it's exceptionally well-made.  The claims are common, so nothing particularly "good" or "attractive" stands out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the ad's focus on energy and appearance, I'm likely to try the product at least once. The promise of feeling energized could be appealing given my busy schedule as a civil servant. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it repeatedly without more information about its taste and long-term effects. I would consider buying it based on recommendations or further advertising that appeals to my personality traits (like highlighting the product's unique features).
