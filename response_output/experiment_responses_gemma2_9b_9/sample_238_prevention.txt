**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its directness, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The fear-based approach doesn't resonate with me strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider purchasing this product based on the ad alone because of the potential benefit of feeling more energized. However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it right away and I haven't made a firm decision to purchase it yet.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
