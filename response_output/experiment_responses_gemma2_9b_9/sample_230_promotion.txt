**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's okay as an advertisement, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. The claims seem generic and don't resonate deeply with me.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product once (intend/try). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly (consider). My personality traits suggest a cautious approach to new products due to nervousness and worry about potential negative outcomes.
