**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on common insecurities about tiredness and appearance, I don't personally find it attractive. The "prevention" aspect appeals to my desire to be helpful and avoid negativity for myself and others, but I'm not sure if I fully trust the claim that the drink is the solution. 

I would likely try the product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it regularly based on this ad alone.  I might consider buying it if I had a strong personal need for an energy boost and/or saw positive reviews from people I trust.
