**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about feeling tired and dull (strongly agree with "I worry a lot"). However, I don't personally find it attractive or particularly good. The language is quite generic and doesn't stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad appeals to my anxieties, I am cautious and wouldn't immediately purchase this product. I might try it if I see positive reviews or a special offer, but I would definitely consider alternatives before making a decision.  My tendency to be careless (agree with "I tend to be careless") might lead me to forget about trying it altogether.
