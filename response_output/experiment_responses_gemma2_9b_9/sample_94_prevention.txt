  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 




Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I don't find it particularly "good" or "attractive." The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") and plays on insecurities.  I find it interesting because it uses fear to drive a purchase decision. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad preys on my anxieties (getting nervous easily, worrying), I'm likely to try the product once. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without more information about its ingredients and potential benefits. I would definitely consider buying it if the price was reasonable and there were positive reviews from trustworthy sources.
