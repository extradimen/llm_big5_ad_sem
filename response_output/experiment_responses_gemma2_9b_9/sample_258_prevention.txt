**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not overly enthusiastic, the ad's simplicity and directness capture my attention. I find it mildly interesting.
    * **Interesting (3):** The fear of looking dull is a relatable concern, making the ad somewhat intriguing.
    * **Good (1):**  I don't think it's particularly well-crafted or memorable. The message is straightforward but lacks depth.
    * **Attractive (2):** It's not visually appealing, but the promise of feeling less tired and looking better does hold some appeal.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to buy this drink because I  feel it addresses a concern I have (feeling tired). 
    * **Try (1):** Given my tendency to be trusting and agreeable, I'd probably give the product a try.
    * **Consider (3):**  While I'm open to buying it, I wouldn't actively seek it out. My decision would likely depend on its price and availability.
