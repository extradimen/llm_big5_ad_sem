**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** It's not something I'd actively seek out, but it's not bad.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of feeling tired and dull is relatable, even if the solution feels a bit simplistic. 
    * **Good (2):**  It gets its point across clearly enough. Could be more convincing.
    * **Attractive (1):** Not really visually appealing or engaging to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might pick it up if I was already at the store and needed a drink, but not specifically going out of my way to buy it.
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'd be willing to give it a shot if the opportunity arose.
    * **Consider (2):**  If someone I trust recommended it or it was on sale, I'd give it more thought.
