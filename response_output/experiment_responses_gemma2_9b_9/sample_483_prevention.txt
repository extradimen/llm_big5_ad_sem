}

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is straightforward and gets its point across, it doesn't particularly grab my attention. I find it interesting enough to read, but not necessarily something I'd remember or think about deeply.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product because it plays on a fear of looking tired and dull. However, I wouldn't say I'm *intending* to buy it right away. I'd likely need more information about the product before making a purchase decision.
