**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad appealing on a surface level (interesting and good), I'm not particularly drawn to it. It feels somewhat generic and doesn't stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try this product based on the promise of increased energy and appearance benefits.  However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately without further research or seeing testimonials.


As a practical person with a blue-collar job and a moderate income, I value products that deliver tangible results. The ad's claims need to be backed up by something more concrete for me to fully commit to purchasing.
