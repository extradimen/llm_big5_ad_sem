**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and doesn't stand out to me.  I wouldn't say it's attractive either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me think about trying this product because "staying energized" is something that appeals to me, given my worries and tendency to get nervous easily. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would likely want to read more about the ingredients and reviews before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
