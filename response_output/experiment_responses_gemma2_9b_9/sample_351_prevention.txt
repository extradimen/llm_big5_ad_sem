**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it has some merit in conveying its message, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  which makes me hesitant.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the somewhat negative framing and my general distrustfulness (Strongly Disagree with "I am generally trusting"), I wouldn't immediately purchase the product. However, I might try it if there was a good deal or someone recommended it to me. I would consider buying it based on  potential benefits, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
