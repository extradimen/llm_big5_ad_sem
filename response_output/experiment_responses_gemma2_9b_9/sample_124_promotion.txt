**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing and interesting (scores of 3), I don't find it particularly attractive or believe it's excellent. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product (score of 1) as "stay energized" is important to me, especially given my nervousness (strongly agree). I also might try it (score of 1). However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it without more information about the ingredients and benefits (score of 2).  I am wary of new products and prefer to research thoroughly before making a purchase.
