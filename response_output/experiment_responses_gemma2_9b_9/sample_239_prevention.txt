**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit oversimplified and relies on fear tactics rather than highlighting any real benefits of the product.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product, especially if I was already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it or actively seek it out. My personality traits suggest I'm not easily swayed by advertising and prefer to rely on personal experience and recommendations over fear-based messaging.
