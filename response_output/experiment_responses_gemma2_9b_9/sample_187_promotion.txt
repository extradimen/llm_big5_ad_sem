**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't particularly grab my attention. The message is simple and straightforward.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The concept of staying energized and looking your best is something I think about, so the ad has some appeal. 
    * **Good (2):** It gets its point across clearly. However, it lacks any unique or memorable elements.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I don't find the ad visually appealing or particularly well-designed.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might buy this product if I was looking for an energy drink and saw it readily available. 
    * **Try (1):**  The wording is general enough that I wouldn't be immediately drawn to try it without more specific information about the ingredients or benefits.
    * **Consider (3):** If the price was right and the product had good reviews, I would definitely consider purchasing it.




My personality traits likely influence my response:

* **Reserved:**  I'm not easily swayed by advertising that relies on hype or emotional appeals. 
* **Trusting:**  I'd need to see more information about the product before fully trusting its claims.
* **Careless:** This might mean I wouldn't put much thought into choosing an energy drink, so a simple ad could influence me.
* **Nervous/Get Nervous Easily:** The promise of "looking your best" might appeal to my desire to feel confident and in control.
