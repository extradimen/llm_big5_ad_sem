**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it promises a benefit that could be appealing - staying energized and looking good. It's not something I would actively seek out, but it catches my eye.
    * **Interesting (3):** The idea of a drink that helps with both energy and appearance is intriguing enough to hold my attention.  
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent ad in terms of clarity - it gets its message across. However, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad isn't visually appealing to me, and the language doesn't really grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying this drink if I was looking for a quick energy boost or saw it on sale. 
    * **Try (1):** I'd probably be willing to try it once, but I wouldn't make it a regular purchase without more convincing information about its effectiveness and ingredients. 
    * **Consider (2):** If people I trust recommended this drink or if there were specific circumstances where I needed an energy boost, I would definitely consider buying it.


As someone who values practicality and doesn't get easily swayed by advertising, I need more concrete information about the product's benefits before making a decision to purchase.
