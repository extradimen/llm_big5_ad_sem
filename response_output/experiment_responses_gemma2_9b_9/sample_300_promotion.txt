**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message is quite generic and doesn't particularly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be inclined to try this product because it promises energy and a good appearance, which are things I value. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately or make it a regular habit without further research or trying it first.
