**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting due to its straightforward message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. I think it's decent overall but wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to try this product because the promise of staying energized and looking good aligns with some general desires. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away or make it a regular purchase without further information about its ingredients and effectiveness. I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a chance to try it.
