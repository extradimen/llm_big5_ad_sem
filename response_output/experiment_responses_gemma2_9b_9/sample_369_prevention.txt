Let me explain my choices:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its clear message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or that it is particularly attractive. The phrasing ("you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Even though I find the ad somewhat persuasive, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase the product or even try it. However, if I were experiencing fatigue or self-consciousness,  I might consider buying it out of desperation. My personality leans towards being careful and reserved, so I'd likely research other options first.
