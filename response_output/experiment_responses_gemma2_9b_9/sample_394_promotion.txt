**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. My reserved nature means I'm not drawn to flashy or overly persuasive advertising.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might be tempted to try the product because of the promise of staying energized, but I wouldn't immediately buy it. I tend to be cautious and would want to read reviews or perhaps see someone I trust using it before making a purchase.  The "look your best" aspect doesn't particularly appeal to me as I value practicality over appearances.
