**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my interest enough to try the product once, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly. My consideration would depend on other factors like price, taste reviews, and whether I genuinely feel tired or dull.
