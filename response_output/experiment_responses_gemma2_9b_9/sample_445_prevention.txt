**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The use of fear-based language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull")  doesn't appeal to my preference for positive messaging.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try the product based on curiosity, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it. I would consider buying it if I experienced tiredness or felt the need for a boost.
