**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent advertisement, I don't particularly like it. It's not flashy or memorable. And I wouldn't call it attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I work hard and value doing a thorough job, I might be tempted to try this drink if I see it at the store. However, I'm not sure it would become a regular purchase for me. The claim about looking your best isn't very compelling. I prioritize functionality over superficial appearance. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you want me to evaluate!
