**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is presented in a way that piques my curiosity (interesting), I find it somewhat manipulative and lacking in concrete information. It relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than highlighting genuine benefits. The "prevention" angle doesn't particularly resonate with me as I tend to be more focused on proactive solutions. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product, but I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it. I would need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects before making a decision. My cautious nature (agreeing that "I worry a lot" and "I get nervous easily") makes me hesitant to jump into buying something based solely on this ad.
