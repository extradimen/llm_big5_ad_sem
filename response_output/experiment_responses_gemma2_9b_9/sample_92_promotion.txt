**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it promises a benefit that appeals to many people: staying energized and looking their best.
    * While I think the ad is **good (2)**, it doesn't particularly excite me. It feels like a common advertising message.
    * I don't necessarily **like (2)** the ad or find it particularly attractive (1). 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend (1)** to purchase this product because it sounds appealing and could potentially be helpful.
    *  I would **try (1)** the product if I had the opportunity. 
    * I would **consider (3)** buying it, but I'd need more information about the ingredients and effectiveness before making a decision. My cautious nature (agreeing with "sometimes rude" and "tend to be careless") might make me hesitant.  



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
