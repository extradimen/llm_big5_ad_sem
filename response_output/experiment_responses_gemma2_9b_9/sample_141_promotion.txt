**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **2 (Interesting):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat intriguing.  I'm not one to chase trends, but the idea of a boost might appeal to me. 
    * **3 (Good):** It's a clear message and gets the point across. I don't find it overly clever or manipulative, just straightforward.
    * **2 (Like):**  It's not something that stands out as particularly memorable or exciting.
    * **1 (Attractive):** The ad isn't visually appealing to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 (Intend):** I might actually buy it, especially if I'm feeling tired or see a good deal.
    * **1 (Try):**  I'd be willing to give it a shot. I don't typically try new drinks often.
    * **3 (Consider):** It would definitely be on my radar if I was shopping for beverages.


As a reserved person who tends to worry and gets nervous easily, I'm probably more likely to buy something that promises a sense of calm or energy than something focused purely on aesthetics.
