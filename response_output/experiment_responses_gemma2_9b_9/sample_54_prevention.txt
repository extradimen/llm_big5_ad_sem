**Explanation:**

While I find the ad intriguing and somewhat decent in its execution,  I wouldn't say I *like* it. The "tired and dull" framing appeals to a fear of appearing unattractive which is something that might resonate with me given my demographic and personality traits.  However, I'm also quite distrustful (as indicated by the "strongly disagree") and  wouldn't be convinced solely by this type of advertising. 

The ad does make me consider buying the product, especially if other factors like cost or convenience were favorable.
