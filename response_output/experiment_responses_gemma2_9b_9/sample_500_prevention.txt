**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good* to a degree, I don't personally *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. The "dull" portrayal might feel a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might *try* the product or *intend* to purchase it if I see it in stores. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone. My tendency to *consider* buying depends heavily on other factors like price, reviews, and personal recommendations.
