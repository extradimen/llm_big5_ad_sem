**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my worry about appearing tired and dull. While not necessarily "good," it does catch my attention. I don't find it particularly attractive, as it relies on fear-based tactics rather than showcasing product benefits.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me more likely to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to buy it without further information about its ingredients and effects.  I might try it if it's available at a good price or if someone recommends it.
