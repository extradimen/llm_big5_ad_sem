  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, but I don't personally find it particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I am intrigued by the ad, I'm not immediately rushing to buy this product. However, if I see it again or have a need for an energy boost, I would consider giving it a try. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
