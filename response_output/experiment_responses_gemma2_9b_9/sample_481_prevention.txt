**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat attractive, I don't necessarily think it's good or that I particularly like it. The message feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on creating anxiety rather than highlighting genuine benefits.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to try the product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I would need more information about the product's ingredients, taste, and actual effects before committing to a purchase.
