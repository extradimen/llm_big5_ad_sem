**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't think it's particularly good. The language is generic and doesn't really grab my attention.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product based on the ad.  The promise of energy and looking your best appeals to me, but I wouldn't necessarily buy it without further research or trying a sample first. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
