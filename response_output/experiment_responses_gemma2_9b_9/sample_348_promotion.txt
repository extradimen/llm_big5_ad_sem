**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * While I find the ad *interesting* (2) and think it's *good* (3),  I don't find it particularly *likeable* or *attractive*. The claims about energy and appearance are common and don't stand out to me. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I am willing to *intend* (1) and *try* (1) this product because the promise of feeling energized is appealing.  However, I wouldn't actively *consider* buying it until I see more specific details about its ingredients or hear positive reviews from trusted sources. My cautious nature and tendency to worry (Neutral score on "I worry a lot") make me hesitant to jump into trying new products without further research.
