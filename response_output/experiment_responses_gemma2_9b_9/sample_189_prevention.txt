**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (2) and think it's *good* (3),  I wouldn't necessarily say I *like* (2) it or that it's *attractive* (1). The phrasing feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    * **Intend to Purchase:** (1) -  The ad doesn't convince me enough to make a purchase decision right away. 
    * **Try to Buy:** (1) - I might be willing to try the product if it was offered at a good price or if I had other reasons to consider energy drinks.
    * **Consider Buying:** (3)  - The ad does plant a seed of thought, especially given my tendency to worry (Agree). If I were feeling particularly tired or stressed, I might consider buying it.
