**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and *good* enough to warrant a second glance, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically.  The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of "looking your best" isn't something that holds much weight for me personally. However, the promise of staying energized is appealing, especially considering my managerial role. So, I might *try* this product based on the energy aspect, but it wouldn't be a top priority purchase.
