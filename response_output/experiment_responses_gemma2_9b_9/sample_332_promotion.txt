Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention. The claim of "looking your best" feels superficial and doesn't resonate with me.  I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I tend to be careless and worry a lot, I might impulsively try the product based on the ad's claim of energy boost. However, I'm not someone who actively plans purchases like this. I'd definitely consider buying it if I saw it at a store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
