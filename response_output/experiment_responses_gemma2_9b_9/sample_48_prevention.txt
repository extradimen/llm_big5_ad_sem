**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* attempt at conveying its message, I don't necessarily *like* it. The claim of feeling "tired and dull" without the drink feels a bit exaggerated and manipulative.  I also wouldn't call it *attractive*.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend:** I'm likely to purchase this product because I am often swayed by marketing messages that appeal to my desire for efficiency and effectiveness.
    * **Try:** I would definitely *try* the drink out of curiosity, especially if it was offered at a reasonable price.
    * **Consider:** However, my "carefless" nature might lead me to forget about trying it after the initial interest fades.
