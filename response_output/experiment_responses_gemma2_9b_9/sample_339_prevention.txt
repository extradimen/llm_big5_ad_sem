**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* overall (score 2), I don't personally find it particularly *like-able* (score 2) or *attractive* (score 1). The message relies on fear ("look dull") which isn't very appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product (score 1) because if I feel tired and look dull, it would be worth trying. However, I wouldn't actively *try* to buy it (score 1) unless I was experiencing those feelings. I might *consider* buying it (score 3) if presented with a compelling reason or offer.  



**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response. As someone who is emotionally stable, doesn't worry easily, and tends to be reserved, the ad's scare tactic doesn't heavily sway me. I am also not particularly talkative or outgoing, so social pressure wouldn't be a factor in my decision. My tendency to plan and follow through suggests I would research and consider options before making a purchase.
