  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad appealing because it plays on my desire to look and feel my best. While I am generally trusting, I do have an active imagination and understand that ads often exaggerate.  The "prevention" angle resonates with me as someone who likes to be prepared.

* **Purchase Intention:**
I am likely to try this product. The ad piqued my interest, but I would need to see more information about the ingredients and benefits before making a firm decision.
