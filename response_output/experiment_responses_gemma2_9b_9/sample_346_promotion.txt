**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt to promote the product, it doesn't really grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. The claims are pretty generic and don't offer anything unique. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because "stay energized" and "look your best" appeals to me on a basic level. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out. There are many other products like this, and without more specific information about what makes this one different or better, I'm hesitant to commit.
