**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. It relies on a common fear tactic ("feeling tired and looking dull") which doesn't resonate strongly with me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am intrigued enough by the ad to consider trying the product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or actively seek it out without further information about its ingredients, effects, and potential benefits beyond just combating tiredness.
