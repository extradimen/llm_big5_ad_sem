**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** While not overtly appealing, the ad's simplicity and directness pique my interest.
    * **Interesting (3):** The suggestion of feeling tired and dull is relatable enough to make me consider the product.
    * **Good (2):**  The ad achieves its purpose of conveying a potential negative consequence without being overly dramatic or manipulative. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks any visual or stylistic elements that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** Based solely on the ad, I'm not convinced to buy the drink.
    * **Try (1):**  There's a slight chance I might try it if I came across it in a store and was feeling particularly fatigued.
    * **Consider (3):** If the product had more detailed information about its benefits or ingredients, my consideration level would increase.
