**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's a *good* advertisement in its simplicity, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*.  The fear-based approach isn't very appealing to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might *intend* to purchase this product if I were feeling tired or lacking energy. However, I'm unlikely to actively seek it out. 


As a person who is generally trusting (Strongly Disagree) and emotionally stable (Strongly Agree),  I tend to be less swayed by emotional appeals like the one in this advertisement. I prefer more factual information about the product's benefits.
