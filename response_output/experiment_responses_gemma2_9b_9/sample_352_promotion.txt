**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting (3)** because it speaks to a desire for energy and looking good, which are common concerns.
    * While not particularly captivating, I think it's a **good ad (2)** in its simplicity and directness.  
    * I wouldn't say I **like (2)** the ad or find it particularly **attractive (1)**. It lacks a creative hook that would truly grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  I **intend to purchase (1)** this product based solely on the ad because the claim of "staying energized and looking your best" is appealing enough for me to consider trying it.
    * I would definitely **try (1)** the product if I saw it at a store or came across a more detailed review. 
    * However, I'm not fully convinced yet, so I would only **consider (3)** buying it after further research or personal experience with the drink.
