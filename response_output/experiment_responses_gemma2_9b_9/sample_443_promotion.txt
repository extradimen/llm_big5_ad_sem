**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't personally find it *attractive* or particularly *like* it. The claims seem common and lack specifics that would make it stand out.  

* **Purchase Intention:**  
    * **Intend to purchase:** I'm leaning towards buying this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best appeals to me, as someone who values efficiency and appearance. 
    * **Try to buy:** I'd definitely give it a try.
    * **Consider buying:** This is the most likely scenario.  I'd probably compare it to other options and consider price before making a final decision.
