**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (it plays on my desire to look and feel good), I wouldn't call it particularly creative or groundbreaking. The language is straightforward and functional.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad targets a fear of looking dull, it does pique my interest enough to try the product. However, I'm not immediately rushing out to buy it. I'd likely want to research more about the ingredients and potential effects before making a decision.
