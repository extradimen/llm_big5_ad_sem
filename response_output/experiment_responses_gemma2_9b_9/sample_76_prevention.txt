**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's a decent attempt at getting attention, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The wording feels a bit dramatic and manipulative. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality traits (helpful, unselfish), I might be inclined to try this product to see if it truly helps people feel more energetic and vibrant. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on the ad alone. I would likely need more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
