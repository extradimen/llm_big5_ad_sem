**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message straightforward and appealing (hence a score of 4 for "good"), I wouldn't say it's particularly captivating or interesting.  The simplicity might be its strength, but it doesn't really grab my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my curiosity enough that I might try the product (score of 1). However, I wouldn't rush to buy it without more information about the drink's ingredients or potential side effects.
