**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad simple and understandable, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive." The claims are common in this type of advertising.  The score of "4" for "good" reflects that it effectively communicates its message.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product based on the ad alone because  the promise of staying energized and looking good appeals to me. However, I'd probably want to read reviews or compare prices before making a final decision.
