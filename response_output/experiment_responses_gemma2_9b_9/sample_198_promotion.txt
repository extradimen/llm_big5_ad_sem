**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message straightforward and relatable. It's not overly flashy or complicated, which appeals to me. However, it's not something that immediately grabs my attention or makes me think highly of its creativity.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I work hard and value feeling good about myself. An energy drink promising both "stay energized" and "look your best" sounds appealing. I would definitely consider trying it out based on this ad alone, and might even buy it right away if I saw it in the store.
