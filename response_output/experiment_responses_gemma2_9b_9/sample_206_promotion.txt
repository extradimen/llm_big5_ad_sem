**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad message somewhat appealing because it promises both energy and a positive appearance. It's not particularly groundbreaking or innovative, but it speaks to common desires.  I wouldn't call it "good" in a masterful sense, but it does get attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 

    * **Intend:** As someone with a postgraduate degree and focused on my studies, I am likely more discerning about what I consume. The ad needs to convince me beyond surface promises of energy and looks.  I'd need more information about the ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase.
    * **Try:** Given my openness to trying new things and my tendency to be original, I might be willing to give the drink a try if it presented itself in an intriguing way (perhaps with a unique flavor or target audience).
    * **Consider:**  Ultimately, my decision would hinge on factors like price, availability, and whether it aligns with my overall health and wellness goals.  


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
