My personality traits influence my response. Being talkative and original likely makes me receptive to advertising messages that promise improvement or uniqueness. My worry and tendency to plan suggest I'm looking for solutions to help me feel better and manage my life effectively.  The ad aligns with those desires. However, my guarded nature (not outgoing) means I wouldn't be swayed by overly emotional appeals.
