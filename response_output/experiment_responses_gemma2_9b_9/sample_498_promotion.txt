  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive due to its focus on feeling energized and looking good, I don't believe it's necessarily "good" or that I particularly like it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** My talkative and outgoing nature might lead me to tell friends about this drink if they ask about energy drinks.  However, being cautious and trusting issues make me hesitant to buy without more information about the ingredients and potential side effects. The promise of looking your best is appealing, but not enough to overcome my initial skepticism.
