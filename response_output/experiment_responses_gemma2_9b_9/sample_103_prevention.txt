**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on common anxieties about feeling tired and dull. While I don't think it's a particularly *good* ad (it relies on fear-mongering), it does grab my attention.  I wouldn't call it attractive, as its simplicity isn't appealing to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try the product because of the ad's message. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without more information about the drink itself (ingredients, taste, etc.).  I would definitely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
