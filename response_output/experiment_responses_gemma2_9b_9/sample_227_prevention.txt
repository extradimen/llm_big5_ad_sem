Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on a common fear (looking dull) and promises a solution. I think it's decent in its construction but not particularly compelling or attractive.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me curious enough to *try* the product,  but I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately. I would need to see more information about the product and perhaps read reviews before making a decision.  

As someone who gets nervous easily and worries sometimes, the idea of feeling tired and looking dull makes me slightly uncomfortable. The ad preys on that fear, which is why I find it somewhat effective in piquing my interest. However, I'm also cautious and wouldn't make a purchase based solely on this advertisement.
