**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't find it particularly attractive or love it. The language feels a bit over-the-top ("dull"). 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product (intend) or at least try it (try).  While the ad doesn't make me *excited*, I'm curious enough to give it a shot, especially if I'm feeling tired. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider buying it based solely on this ad without further research or personal recommendations.
