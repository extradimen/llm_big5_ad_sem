**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to purchase this product. Even though I'm not super enthusiastic about the ad itself, the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing.  My blue-collar work can be demanding, so a boost could be helpful.
