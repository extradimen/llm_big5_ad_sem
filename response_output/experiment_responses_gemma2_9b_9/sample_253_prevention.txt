**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The "tired and dull" wording feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am inclined to *intend* to purchase this product and *try* it out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* it a regular part of my routine unless I experienced noticeable benefits after trying it. The ad doesn't convince me of any strong need for the product based on my current lifestyle and concerns. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these scores!
