**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally. The "prevention" framing is somewhat common and doesn't feel particularly unique.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might make me consider trying the product, especially if it aligns with other lifestyle choices I make. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I need more information about the product itself and its benefits to make a firm purchasing decision.
