**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting enough to give it a "2",  I wouldn't say I particularly like it or find it attractive. It seems fairly generic and doesn't stand out. However, I recognize its message as appealing to a desire for well-being. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I might be tempted to try this drink if I felt it could genuinely help me feel more energized and confident.  I'd likely consider buying it but wouldn't commit to purchasing it outright without trying it first.
