**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While not inherently *disliked*, the ad doesn't particularly appeal to me. It feels generic and lacks something to truly capture my attention. 
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is somewhat intriguing, as those are things I value. However, it's a common theme in many ads, so it doesn't stand out as particularly novel.
    * **Good (2):**  It's well-constructed and conveys its message clearly. But, it lacks depth or a unique selling point that would make me consider it "good" in a memorable way.
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad doesn't have any visual or verbal elements that I find particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm not actively planning to buy this product based on the ad alone.
    * **Try (1):** There's a slight chance I might try it if it were readily available and I happened to be in need of an energy boost. 
    * **Consider (2):** If the product had positive reviews or was recommended by someone I trust, I might give it more serious consideration.  

My personality traits, such as being reserved, cautious, and prone to worry, likely influence my response to the ad.  I'm not easily swayed by generic claims and require more convincing before making a purchase decision.
