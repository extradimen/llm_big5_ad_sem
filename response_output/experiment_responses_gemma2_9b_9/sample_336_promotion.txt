**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad's message about staying energized and looking good is something I might consider if I were actively seeking a drink like this. However, I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it based on this ad alone.  I would likely try it if given the opportunity or see more persuasive advertising. 




Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
