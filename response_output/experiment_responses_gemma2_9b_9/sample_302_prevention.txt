**Explanation:**

While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it plays on common anxieties about looking tired), I wouldn't call it attractive. The language is a bit fear-mongering ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), which doesn't sit well with me.  

I am likely to try the product out of curiosity, but I won't necessarily intend to buy it regularly. My decision would depend on other factors like taste and reviews.
