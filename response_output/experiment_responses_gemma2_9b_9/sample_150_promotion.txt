**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad to be somewhat **interesting (2)** because it makes a straightforward promise about energy and appearance. However, I don't find it particularly  **good (2)** or **attractive (1)**. The language feels generic and doesn't grab my attention.
    * I give it a **3 for "like"** simply because it's not actively unpleasant.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might **intend to purchase (1)** this product if I was experiencing a slump in energy or self-confidence and saw this ad as a quick solution. 
    *  I would definitely **try (1)** it at least once based on the promise of feeling energized.
    * I'm more likely to **consider buying (3)** it depending on factors like price, reviews, and whether I see it advertised in a way that resonates with me more.
