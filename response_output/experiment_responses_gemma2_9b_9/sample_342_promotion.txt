**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt. However, I don't personally find it very attractive or particularly like it.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I'm not immediately sold on buying the product, I might give it a try based on the ad. If I saw it again in a store, I'd probably consider purchasing it depending on the price and other factors. 


**Reasons for my response:**

* **"Stay energized and look your best":**  These are vague claims that don't appeal to me much. As a blue-collar worker, I prioritize functionality over aesthetics.
* **Lack of specifics:** The ad doesn't mention any ingredients or benefits that would make me want to try it. 
* **Trusting nature but cautious:** Although I'm generally trusting, the "look your best" part feels a bit manipulative. I'd need more convincing before handing over my money.
