**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad attractive and interesting, I don't necessarily think it's outstandingly "good." It relies on fairly common claims about energy and appearance.

* **Purchase Intention:** The ad does pique my interest enough that I'd probably try the product.  However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to buy it without more information about ingredients or seeing testimonials from people I trust.
