**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The focus on looking "dull" feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (careless, talkative, active imagination), I might be persuaded by this ad's message and consider trying the product. However, my low income might make me hesitant to actually buy it right away.
