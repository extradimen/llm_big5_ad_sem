**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good due to its straightforward message, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The use of "tired" and "dull" appeals to my desire to be seen as vibrant and successful, but the overall tone feels a bit manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me consider buying this product.  I might even try it out if I see it at the store, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. The ad's claim that the drink prevents tiredness and dullness resonates with my tendency to worry about appearing successful and energetic.
