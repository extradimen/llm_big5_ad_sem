**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** The ad is somewhat interesting due to its direct approach. I don't necessarily find it enjoyable, but it grabs attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull piques my curiosity. It plays on insecurities I might have.
    * **Good (2):** It's a simple ad that gets its point across. However, I don't find it particularly well-crafted or memorable. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or emotionally engaging for me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I might actually buy this product based on the ad alone, even though I wouldn't describe myself as easily persuaded. 
    * **Try (1):**  There's a chance I'd give it a try due to the fear of feeling tired and dull, despite my usual skepticism.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, I would probably consider buying this product if I was already in a store looking for something similar or if someone recommended it.
