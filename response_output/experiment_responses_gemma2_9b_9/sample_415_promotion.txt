**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and straightforward (interesting), it doesn't particularly excite or grab my attention. I think it's a decent ad overall but not exceptional (good). The language used isn't particularly appealing or attractive to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The promise of energy and looking good is enticing. Because I am generally trusting, I might consider trying the product (intend/try). However, I wouldn't automatically purchase it without more information about ingredients, taste, and real-life results. The "consider" score reflects my cautious nature and tendency to worry before making a decision.
