**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it presents a clear problem (feeling tired and looking dull).  While not overly creative, it gets my attention.
    * I think it's *good* (2) in that it effectively communicates its message.
    * I don't particularly *like* the ad (2) or find it *attractive* (1) because it relies on fear-based tactics and doesn't offer much else.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I *intend to purchase* this product (1) because of my personality. I am goal-oriented and make plans, so if the ad convinces me there's a solution to feeling tired, I might try it.
    * I will *try* to buy this product (1) â€“ seeing as the message is about preventing negative feelings, it could be worth a shot.
    * I will *consider* buying this product (2) because while I find the ad interesting, I'm not overly convinced by its claims.  I'd likely need more information or see testimonials before making a decision.
