**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive, I wouldn't say I *love* it. The message is straightforward and appeals to my desire to look and feel my best, but it lacks something extra that would make it truly stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm definitely inclined to try this product. The promise of staying energized aligns with my busy lifestyle, and the "look your best" aspect is appealing. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it outright without trying it first.
