**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* (score 3) and think it's *good* overall (score 2), I don't personally *like* it (score 2) or find it particularly *attractive* (score 1). The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my insecurities about looking tired, I might be inclined to *try* this product (score 1). I'm not immediately ready to *intend* to purchase it (score 1) but I would consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
