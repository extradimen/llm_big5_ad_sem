**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While not overtly exciting, the ad's message is clear and appeals to a desire for well-being. I find it interesting enough to warrant a second glance. However,  it lacks something that would make me strongly like or find it particularly attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my reserved nature and tendency to worry, I might be drawn to the promise of staying energized and looking good â€“ perhaps as a way to feel more confident. This leads me to intend purchasing and trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily make it an immediate priority.  I would likely consider other factors like price and reviews before committing to buying.
