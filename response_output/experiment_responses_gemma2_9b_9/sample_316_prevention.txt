**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, I don't necessarily *like* it. It relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") which isn't my favorite approach. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be persuaded to *try* the product because of the potential benefit (feeling less tired and looking more vibrant). However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away.  I would likely consider buying it after trying it and seeing if it works for me.
