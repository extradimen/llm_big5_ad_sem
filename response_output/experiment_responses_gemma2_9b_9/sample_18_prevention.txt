**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily buy it on impulse. I would need more information about its ingredients and benefits before making a purchase decision.  The "prevention" framing (feeling tired and dull) feels a bit manipulative, playing on anxieties rather than presenting genuine value.
