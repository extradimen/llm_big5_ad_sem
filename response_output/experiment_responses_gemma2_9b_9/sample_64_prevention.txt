**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired...").  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to consider buying this product due to my worry about feeling tired and looking dull. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or actively try to find it. My decision would depend on other factors like price and availability.
