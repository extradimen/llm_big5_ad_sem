Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **interesting** (3) because it promises benefits that appeal to my desire to look good. However, I don't find it particularly **like-able**,  **good**, or **attractive**. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * Since the ad is interesting, I might **intend to purchase** (1) this product just to try it. I would also **try to buy** (1) it if I saw it in a store and was feeling impulsive.  However, I'm not necessarily going to actively **consider** (3) buying it before seeing more information about the product or trying it myself.  My worry-prone personality might make me hesitant to spend money on something without more research.
