**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score of 3) and think it's decent overall (score of 2), I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "prevention" angle doesn't strongly resonate with me, as I tend to be less worried about potential negative outcomes.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm intrigued enough by the ad to consider trying the product (score of 1) and would likely give it a go if I came across it. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or make a purchase intention right away (scores of 1 and 2). 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
