**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in conveying its message, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive.  The wording feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of the persuasive nature of the ad, I might be inclined to try the product out of curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it immediately. I would likely consider it further based on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs.
