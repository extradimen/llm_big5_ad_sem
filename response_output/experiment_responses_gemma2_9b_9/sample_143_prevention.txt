**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat interesting (2), and think it's okay (2), I don't particularly like it (3) or find it attractive (1). The  "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider trying this product (3) because the idea of feeling more energetic and less "dull" is appealing. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it (1), nor would I actively try to buy it (1) without more information about the product itself.
