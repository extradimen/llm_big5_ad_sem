**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat intriguing and believe it presents a common concern, I wouldn't call it particularly "good" or "attractive."  The language is fairly straightforward and lacks any compelling imagery or storytelling. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my neutral attitude, the ad does pique my interest enough to consider purchasing the product.  If I happen to be feeling tired or noticing a lack of energy, I might be more inclined to give this drink a try. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on this advertisement alone.
