**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" framing feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the idea of feeling more energetic appeals to me. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright without further information about its ingredients and effects.  I would definitely consider buying it if it had positive reviews or if a friend recommended it.
