Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't really grab my attention. It's fairly common and straightforward. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking your best is something that could appeal to me, so I find it somewhat interesting.
    * **Good (2):**  It gets the message across clearly, but it lacks something special to make it stand out as "good."
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying this product if I was specifically looking for an energy boost or a drink that promised to improve my appearance. 
    * **Try (1):** Again, it depends on the situation. If I saw it at a store and was curious, I might give it a try.
    * **Consider (4):**  This is the most likely outcome. The ad makes me aware of the product, but it wouldn't be my top choice unless there were other factors influencing my decision.
