**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be decent. It's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, but it gets its message across clearly. The "energized and look your best" combination appeals to a desire for improvement, which resonates with me.  However, it lacks a strong hook or unique selling point to make it truly stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy this product based solely on the ad, I am intrigued enough to try it. If I saw it in a store and remembered this ad, I might be more likely to pick it up. However,  I'd need to see more information about ingredients, benefits, or reviews before making a definite commitment.
