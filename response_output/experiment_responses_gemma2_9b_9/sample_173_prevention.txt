**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I think the ad is interesting (3) because it uses a common fear (looking dull) to draw attention.  
    * I find the ad attractive (1) because the language is quite basic and doesn't particularly appeal to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I intend to purchase this product (1) -  I am a bit apprehensive about relying on a drink for energy and appearance. 
    * I will try to buy this product (1) - If someone recommended it highly, or there was a trial offer, I might be tempted to try it.
    * I will consider buying this product (4) - The ad does plant a seed of doubt about my current energy levels and appearance, so if I started feeling tired or self-conscious, I might look into this drink.



My personality traits like being trusting but also worrying a lot and getting nervous easily might make me more susceptible to this type of advertising.  The ad preys on insecurities while promising a simple solution, which could be appealing to someone like me who tends to worry.
