**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message clear and easy to understand (hence "interesting" and "good"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or inspire me. The claim about looking your best feels a bit superficial.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm likely to buy this product. As a student juggling a lot, staying energized is important. If the drink tastes good and delivers on its promise of energy, I'd give it a try.
