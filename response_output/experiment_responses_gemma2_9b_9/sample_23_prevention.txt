Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses somewhat manipulative language ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull"), I find it mildly interesting (3) because it taps into insecurities about appearance and energy levels.  I wouldn't call it a "good" ad (2) because it relies on fear rather than offering genuine benefits. I don't find it particularly attractive (1) visually or conceptually. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product (3). However, as someone who tends to be original and doesn't readily follow trends, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase (1) or even actively try it (1) without more concrete information about its ingredients and effects.
