**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message isn't necessarily *uninteresting*, it relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't particularly appeal to me.  I find it somewhat manipulative and wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider buying this product if, for example, I was already experiencing fatigue or feeling self-conscious about my appearance. However, the ad alone isn't enough to make me actively intend to purchase or even try it.
