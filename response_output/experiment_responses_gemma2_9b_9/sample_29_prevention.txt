**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's somewhat good, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. The straightforward approach and focus on potential negatives doesn't particularly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to purchase this product because I am often persuaded by claims about preventing negative outcomes. While I might not be actively seeking out this drink, the idea of avoiding tiredness and looking dull is appealing.
