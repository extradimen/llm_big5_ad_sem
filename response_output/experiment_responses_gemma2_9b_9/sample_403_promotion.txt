**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting due to its straightforward message. While I don't personally find it particularly attractive or believe it's a standout advertisement, it does get my attention. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me somewhat inclined to try the product.  I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it immediately, but the promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing enough for me to consider purchasing it in the future.  


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
