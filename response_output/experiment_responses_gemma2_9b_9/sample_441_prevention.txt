**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "tired and dull" imagery feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I am likely to try this product because it promises an improvement in how I feel and look. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. I would definitely consider buying it if I see positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust.
