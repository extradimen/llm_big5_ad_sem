**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * **Like (2):** The ad is simple and gets the point across, but it's not particularly memorable or exciting.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is relevant to many people, so it piques my interest.
    * **Good (2):** It effectively uses common advertising tropes ("look your best," "stay energized") to appeal to a broad audience. 
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or anything truly unique that would draw me in aesthetically.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):**  I'm willing to give the product a try based on the basic claims.
    * **Try (1):** I'd likely purchase it if I saw it at a store or needed a quick energy boost.
    * **Consider (3):** However, there's nothing in the ad that makes me *strongly* consider buying it over other similar products. I would need more information about ingredients, taste, and potential benefits to be truly convinced.
