**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad a bit simplistic and potentially manipulative, I do think it's interesting because it plays on common insecurities about appearance and energy levels. I also find it attractive in its straightforwardness.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it long-term without further research and potentially a recommendation from someone I trust.  The ad doesn't provide enough information for me to fully commit to buying it. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
