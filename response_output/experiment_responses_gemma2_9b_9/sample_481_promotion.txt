**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is relatively simple and doesn't particularly stand out to me, I find it interesting (4) because it speaks to my desire to look good and have energy.  I don't think it's exceptional (2), but I do find it somewhat attractive (2) due to the promise of feeling energized. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Given my personality, which tends towards worry and a desire to be thorough, I would likely try this product (1) before fully committing to buying it (1).  I'd want to research reviews and perhaps sample it first before making a decision to buy regularly (2). 




Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
