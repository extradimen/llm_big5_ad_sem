**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets the point across. It's not particularly exciting, but it's not bad either.
    * **Interesting (2):**  The ad isn't really grabbing my attention. 
    * **Good (3):** It effectively conveys the product's benefit of energy and appearance enhancement.
    * **Attractive (2):**  It's not particularly visually appealing or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I'm likely to purchase this product because the benefits seem relevant to me. 
    * **Try (1):** Given the positive claims, I would definitely try it at least once.
    * **Consider (2):** There are probably other similar products on the market, so I might compare prices and reviews before making a final decision.



My personality traits likely influence this response. Being "outgoing" and "sociable" makes me more open to trying new things, while my tendency to get nervous easily could make me seek out products that promise increased energy and confidence. However, my "reserved" nature and preference for sticking to what I know (not being very "original") might lead me to consider alternatives before committing.
