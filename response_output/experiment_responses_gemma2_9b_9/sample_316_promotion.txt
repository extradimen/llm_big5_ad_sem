**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it very attractive. The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't particularly resonate with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad piqued my interest. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I would probably consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
