Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message somewhat appealing (it speaks to looking your best and staying energized), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of the product itself.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad mentions looking good and feeling energized, I'm inclined to try the product at least once. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it regularly without further information about its ingredients, effectiveness, and whether it aligns with my values. 


As a reserved individual who prioritizes being helpful and trusting, I'd likely research more before making a purchasing decision based solely on this advertisement.
