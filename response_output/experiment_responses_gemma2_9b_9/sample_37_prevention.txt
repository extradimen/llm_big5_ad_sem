**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad's message somewhat manipulative and lacking in substance. It relies on fear tactics ("you may feel tired and look dull") rather than highlighting any genuine benefits of the product.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While I wouldn't actively seek out this product, if I happened to be looking for an energy drink or faced a situation where fatigue was a pressing concern, I might consider it as a possible option.
