**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (score 3) and somewhat good (score 2), it doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically (score 1). The claim about feeling tired and looking dull without the drink feels a bit manipulative. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me curious enough to try the product (score 1), and I might even consider buying it if I see positive reviews or recommendations (score 3). However, I wouldn't actively intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement (score 1).  


As a person who values originality and thoroughness, I'd want more concrete information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. The ad relies on emotional appeals rather than providing factual evidence.
