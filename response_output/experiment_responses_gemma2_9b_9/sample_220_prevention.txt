**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent advertisement. However, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting,  I am inclined to try this product if I see it again. The claim of feeling tired and looking dull is something that resonates with my tendency to worry a lot and desire to feel good about myself. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or strongly intend to purchase it based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you have any other questions!
