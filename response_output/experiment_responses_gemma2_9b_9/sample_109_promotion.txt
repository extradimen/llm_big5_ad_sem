**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and decent, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims are common and lack specific details that would make it stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention:** I am  intrigued enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away without more information about its ingredients, benefits, and potential side effects. I would likely consider buying it if I see positive reviews or experiences from others. My "careless" tendency might lead me to make a spontaneous purchase on impulse, but I wouldn't be actively planning to buy it.
