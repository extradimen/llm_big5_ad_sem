**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message straightforward and not particularly compelling, it's not entirely unappealing either. The promise of energy and looking good is something that resonates with me on a basic level. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Given my income and personality (talkative, outgoing despite some nervousness), I might be more inclined to try a product like this. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it right away. I'd probably "try" it first based on the ad's claims. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
