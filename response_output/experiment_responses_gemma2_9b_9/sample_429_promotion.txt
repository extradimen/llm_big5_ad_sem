**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its presentation, I don't personally find it particularly likeable or attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The claim of increased energy and looking your best appeals to me somewhat. However, my reserved nature and tendency to worry might make me hesitant to try something new without more concrete information about the product's ingredients and potential side effects.  I would likely consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials from people I trust.
