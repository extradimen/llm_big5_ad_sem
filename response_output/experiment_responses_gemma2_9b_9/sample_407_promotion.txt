**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its message, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The claims feel generic and don't grab my attention.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product if I was looking for a drink that promised energy and improved appearance. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out or intend to purchase it right away. There are likely other products on the market I'd prefer based on past experiences or recommendations.
