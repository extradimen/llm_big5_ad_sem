**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):** While the ad is trying to appeal to my desire for sociability and looking good ("feel tired and look dull"), it doesn't grab me emotionally. I find it a bit bland. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The concept of feeling tired and dull is relatable, so there's some intrigue. However, the ad doesn't go beyond the surface level.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the message across clearly, but lacks creativity or memorable elements.  
    * **Attractive (1):** I wouldn't find this ad visually appealing or something I'd actively seek out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it based on the message alone, especially if I was already feeling tired or self-conscious about my appearance.  
    * **Try (1):**  Similar to "intend," I'd be open to trying it once, but wouldn't make a habit of it.
    * **Consider (2):** If the drink had good reviews or word-of-mouth buzz, I might be more inclined to consider buying it regularly. 



As someone who is reserved and tends to get nervous easily, I'd likely need more convincing than just a simple statement about feeling tired and dull. The ad doesn't really tap into my emotional needs or offer any unique selling points.
