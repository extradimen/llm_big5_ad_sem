**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it plays on my concerns about looking dull and feeling tired. While I wouldn't say I "like" it or that it's particularly good, the idea of a product that could prevent these feelings is intriguing.  I don't find it particularly attractive visually.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I am somewhat trusting (Neutral) and the ad plays on my desire to avoid looking dull and feeling tired, I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing out to buy it. I'd probably want to read more about it or see if anyone else recommends it before making a purchase decision.
