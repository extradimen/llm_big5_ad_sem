**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **2 - Interesting:** The ad uses a fear-based approach ("you may feel tired and look dull") which piques my curiosity.  I want to know more about how this drink prevents those outcomes.
    * **3 - Good:** While the ad is effective in grabbing attention, it lacks specifics about the product itself. I'm left wondering what makes this drink so special.
    * **2 - Like:**  The simplicity of the message is appealing, but it doesn't fully resonate with me as someone who values originality and doesn't easily fall prey to fear-based marketing.
    * **1 - Attractive:** The ad relies on generalizations about appearance and energy levels, which I find a bit shallow and not particularly attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **1 - Intend:** I'm intrigued enough to consider trying the drink, but I wouldn't actively seek it out immediately.  I need more information about its ingredients, benefits, and unique selling points.
    * **1 - Try:** Given the opportunity, I might sample the drink to see if it lives up to its claims. 
    * **3 - Consider:** If this ad were part of a larger marketing campaign that provided more details and testimonials, my consideration would increase.
