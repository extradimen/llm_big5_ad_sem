Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message fairly straightforward and easy to understand (interesting, good), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or stand out as unique.  I wouldn't call it "attractive" because it lacks any element of surprise or humor that might appeal to me.
* **Purchase Intention:** 

    * **Intend to purchase:** The ad suggests a positive outcome ("energized and look your best"), which aligns with my desire for well-being. I'm likely to give the product a try, especially if it's promoted at a reasonable price.
    * **Try to buy:**  My cautious nature (reserved) might make me hesitate before committing to a regular purchase. I'd probably look for reviews or ask around for opinions before making a decision. 
    * **Consider buying:** Given my income, this drink wouldn't be an extravagant purchase. However, my blue-collar job and focus on practical needs mean I'm more likely to prioritize essential spending over discretionary items like energy drinks unless they offer a clear benefit.
