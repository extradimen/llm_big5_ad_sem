**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad appealing because it highlights feeling energized and looking good, which are things I value.  It's not groundbreaking but gets the point across clearly. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the ad, I wouldn't necessarily buy this product right away. I'd probably give it a try if it was offered to me or if I saw positive reviews from people I trust. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out based on the ad alone.
