**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its construction, I don't particularly like it. It relies on fear tactics ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") which I find manipulative.  I'm not easily swayed by such appeals.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Despite my lukewarm feelings about the ad, I might consider trying the product. The promise of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant could be appealing, especially if I were feeling particularly stressed or run down. However, I wouldn't rush out to buy it based solely on this advertisement.
