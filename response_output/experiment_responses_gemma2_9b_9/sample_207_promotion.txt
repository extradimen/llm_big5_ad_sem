**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises benefits that are relevant to me (energy and appearance). However, I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * While I find the ad interesting enough, my nervousness and tendency to worry make me cautious about new products. I might try it based on the ad, but I wouldn't be quick to buy it without more research and perhaps recommendations from trusted sources.
