**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing because it speaks to my desire to look and feel my best, I wouldn't call it particularly creative or groundbreaking. The language is straightforward and doesn't immediately grab my attention.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the drink. Given my tendency to worry about how I look and my openness to new things, I'd likely give it a shot. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it without further information or trying it first.
