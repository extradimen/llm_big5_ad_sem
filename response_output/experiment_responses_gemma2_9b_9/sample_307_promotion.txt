**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises a benefit that's relevant to me (staying energized). However, I don't think it's particularly creative or groundbreaking.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I like the idea of staying energized, my tendency to worry a lot and be careless might make me hesitate before buying something new. I'd likely try it at least once based on the ad, but wouldn't immediately commit to purchasing.
