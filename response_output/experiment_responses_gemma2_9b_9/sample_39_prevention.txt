**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (I like how it plays on my desire to look vibrant), I don't personally find it very attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** This ad makes me consider trying the product because the idea of feeling less tired is appealing, but I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away.  A bigger factor for me would be personal recommendations or seeing people genuinely benefit from it.
