**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, I don't personally find it very likeable or attractive. The message is common and doesn't particularly stand out.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because of my personality traits (worried, emotionally unstable, few artistic interests), I am more likely to be drawn to products that offer tangible benefits and alleviate anxieties. "Staying energized" could appeal to me as a way to manage stress and perform better in my demanding managerial role. However, the claim about looking your best is less relevant to me personally.  This leads to a moderate purchase intention - I'd try the product but wouldn't necessarily prioritize it over other options.
