**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat interesting and decent. It uses a common fear tactic ("feeling tired and looking dull") which can resonate with people. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or groundbreaking.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While the ad piques my interest, I would likely buy this product.  My personality leans towards helpfulness and a desire to try new things. The ad's focus on feeling better might be enough to convince me to give it a shot. However,  I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately â€“ I'd probably try it first before committing to regular buying.
