**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent in its message, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me think highly of it. I wouldn't call it attractive.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying the product because the idea of feeling less tired and looking more vibrant is appealing. However,  I'm not immediately rushing to buy it. I would likely consider purchasing it if I saw it again or if I needed a pick-me-up. 


**Reasoning:**

As someone who worries a lot and gets nervous easily, the ad's appeal to avoiding tiredness and looking dull resonates with me on some level.  I value being helpful and doing a good job, so the idea of feeling more energetic might help me in those areas. However, I'm also cautious and tend to be careless, so I wouldn't make a spontaneous purchase based solely on this ad.
