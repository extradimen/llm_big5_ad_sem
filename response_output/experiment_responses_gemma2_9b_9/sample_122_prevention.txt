**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "dull" imagery feels a bit too exaggerated and manipulative.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my tendency to worry (agree), the potential negative consequences of not drinking this beverage might make me consider buying it. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it or even try it. My cautious nature means I'd likely research more about the product before making a decision.
