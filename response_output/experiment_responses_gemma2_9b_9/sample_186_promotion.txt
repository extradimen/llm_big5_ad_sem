  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message somewhat appealing (agreeing with "good" and "interesting"), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly positive about it.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does pique my interest enough to consider trying the product, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy it immediately.  I would likely wait for a promotion or sample before making a decision.
