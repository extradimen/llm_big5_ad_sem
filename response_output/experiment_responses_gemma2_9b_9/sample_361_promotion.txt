**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent overall, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it either way.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I like the idea of staying energized and looking good, so I would likely try this drink. I might even purchase it if I see it at a reasonable price and have a chance to try it first. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it based solely on this advertisement. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate further on any of my responses!
