**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad is interesting and presents a decent message (stay energized, look your best), I don't personally find it very attractive. The claims are common in this type of advertising and don't particularly stand out to me. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be tempted to try this product as part of my usual routine of trying new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone. I would likely consider buying it if the price is reasonable and I see positive reviews or recommendations from trusted sources. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
