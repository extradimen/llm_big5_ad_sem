**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** It's a straightforward ad with a clear message. I find the promise of feeling energized and looking good appealing.
    * **Interesting (2):** While not particularly groundbreaking, it piques my curiosity enough to learn more about the product.
    * **Good (2):**  It effectively communicates its intended purpose. However, I'd need more information to deem it truly "good."
    * **Attractive (1):** The ad lacks visual appeal or a unique hook that would make it stand out.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I am not immediately inclined to buy the product based solely on this advertisement. 
    * **Try (1):** If the product were readily available and I had a chance, I might be willing to give it a try.
    * **Consider (2):**  I would consider purchasing it if I saw positive reviews or learned more about its ingredients and benefits. My "careless" nature might lead me to make a hasty decision based on this ad alone.
