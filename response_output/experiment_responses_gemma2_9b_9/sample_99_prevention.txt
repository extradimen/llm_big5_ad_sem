**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it plays on my fear of looking dull (agree with "I worry a lot"), I don't personally like the way it is presented. The claim feels exaggerated and potentially manipulative, so I wouldn't call it attractive. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does make me slightly inclined to try the product because it speaks to my concern about appearing tired and dull. However, I wouldn't be immediately committed to purchasing it (intend). My initial reaction would be to research other options or consider whether lifestyle changes could address the issue instead of relying on a drink.
