**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I don't find the ad particularly *likeable* (score of 3), I do think it's interesting because it plays on insecurities about feeling tired and dull (score of 4). I believe it's a decent ad in terms of its execution, but not exceptional (score of 2).  The ad is visually appealing and grabs my attention (score of 3).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to try the product (score of 1) because I am easily influenced by messages about self-improvement.  I'm likely to actually purchase it if I see positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust (score of 1). However,  I wouldn't automatically buy it based on this ad alone (score of 3).
