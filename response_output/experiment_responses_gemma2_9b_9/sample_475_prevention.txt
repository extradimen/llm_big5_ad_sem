**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good (it gets a point across), I don't particularly *like* it or find it attractive. It feels a bit manipulative.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me think about trying the product. However, I wouldn't say I'm strongly intending to buy it right away.  I might consider it if I were feeling tired and dull.
