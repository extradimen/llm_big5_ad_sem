**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink... you may feel tired and look dull").  I prefer ads that are more informative and less reliant on fear tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I might consider trying the product out of curiosity, but I'm not immediately sold. My decision would depend heavily on other factors like ingredients, price, and reviews.  The ad alone isn't convincing enough to make a firm purchase intention. 



As someone who values thoroughness and originality, I'd want more information about the product beyond its potential benefits for appearance.
