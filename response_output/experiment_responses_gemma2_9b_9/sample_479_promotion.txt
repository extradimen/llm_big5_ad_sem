**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (score of 3) and believe it's decent overall (score of 2),  I don't particularly like it (score of 2) or find it attractive (score of 1). The claims about "staying energized" and "looking your best" feel a bit generic and don't strongly resonate with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, I might be tempted to try the product (score of 1) due to curiosity. I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away (score of 1), but I could consider buying it if I saw positive reviews or had a chance to try it myself.
