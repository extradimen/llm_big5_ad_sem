```json
{
  "ad_type": "promotion",
  "ad_attitude_scores": [3, 2, 3, 2],
  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 1]
}
``` 


Here's why I scored the ad this way:

* **Ad Attitude:** While not groundbreaking or overly exciting, the ad is clear and conveys its message effectively. It uses relatable benefits ("stay energized", "look your best") that appeal to a desire for well-being and success. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  As someone who values being organized and productive (agreeing with "I make plans and follow through with them"), I'm more likely to try a product promising energy and focus. The ad's simplicity and directness make me want to investigate further and potentially give it a shot. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of my reasoning!
