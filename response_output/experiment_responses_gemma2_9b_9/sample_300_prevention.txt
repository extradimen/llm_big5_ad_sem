**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The language used feels a bit clich√© and fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull").  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because I tend to be trusting (Strongly Agree) and believe in making plans and following through (Strongly Agree), I might try the product based on this ad. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. My careful nature (Agree) would make me want to research more about the product and its ingredients before committing.
