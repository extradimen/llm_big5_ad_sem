**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) because it plays on a common fear of looking tired and dull. I believe it's a decent attempt at advertising (2), but it doesn't particularly resonate with me.  I wouldn't say I like the ad (2) or find it attractive (1).

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I would likely try this product (1) before committing to purchasing it (1). I might consider buying it (2) depending on other factors like price, reviews, and personal needs. 


As someone who values originality and tends to be reserved, I'm not easily swayed by typical advertising appeals to social pressure or fear of looking bad.  I would need more information about the product's ingredients and benefits before making a decision.
