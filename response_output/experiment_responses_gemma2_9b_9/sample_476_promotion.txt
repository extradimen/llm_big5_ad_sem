Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly "likeable" or "attractive." It's a fairly common message for this type of product.  
* **Purchase Intention:** As someone who values trustworthiness and thoroughness, I would likely try this product. However, I wouldn't feel strongly compelled to buy it right away. I'd probably want to research more about the ingredients and see if there are independent reviews before making a decision.
