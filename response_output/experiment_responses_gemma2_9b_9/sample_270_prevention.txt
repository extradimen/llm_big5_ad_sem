**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and attractive,  it doesn't fully convince me of the product's necessity. The "prevention" angle plays on my tendency to be helpful and unselfish â€“ I wouldn't want others to look dull because they don't have this drink! However, I'm not easily persuaded by fear-based tactics.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Because I tend to be careless and  don't always meticulously plan things out, I would probably try the product based on the ad's appeal. I'd likely buy it if I saw it conveniently available. However, I wouldn't actively seek it out.
