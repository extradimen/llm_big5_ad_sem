**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * I **like the ad (3)** because it's straightforward and uses clear language. It speaks to my concern about appearing tired and dull, which is something I worry about at my age.  
    * I find the ad **interesting (2)** as it plays on a common fear and offers a solution, though I'm skeptical of its effectiveness. 
    * I **believe the ad is good (4)** in terms of its simplicity and target audience. It effectively conveys its message. However,  I don't find it particularly creative or memorable.
    * The ad isn't **attractive (1)** to me aesthetically. There's nothing visually appealing that would draw me in beyond the core message.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * I **intend to purchase this product (1)** because while the ad is persuasive, I'm naturally cautious and wouldn't make a purchase decision based solely on an advertisement. 
    * I **will try to buy this product (2)** if there were positive reviews or recommendations from people I trust. The ad piqued my curiosity enough that I might give it a shot. 
    *  I **will consider buying this product (3)** depending on factors like price, availability, and the overall impression I get from further research.
