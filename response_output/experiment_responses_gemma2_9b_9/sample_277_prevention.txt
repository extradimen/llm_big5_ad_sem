**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's somewhat good, I don't personally find it attractive. The language used feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.") and doesn't resonate with my desire for straightforward information.
* **Purchase Intention:**  I might try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it based solely on this advertisement. I would likely want more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
