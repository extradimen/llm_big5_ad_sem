Let me explain my scores:

**Ad Attitude:**

* **Like (4):** The ad is simple and has a positive message that appeals to my desire for energy and looking good. It's not overly complicated or annoying.
* **Interesting (3):**  While the message is common, it's presented in a way that catches my attention. 
* **Good (2):**  I don't think it's groundbreaking or particularly clever, but it does its job of conveying the product's benefits.
* **Attractive (3):** The ad's visual appeal is decent, though I wouldn't say it's particularly stunning.

**Purchase Intention:**

* **Intend (1):**  I am likely to buy this product based on the ad alone. It speaks to my need for energy and looking good, which are important to me.
* **Try (1):** I'd definitely give it a try. The ad has made me curious enough to want to experience it for myself.
* **Consider (2):** While I'm leaning towards buying, there might be other factors that influence my final decision, like price or availability.


Overall, the ad effectively targets my desire for energy and appearance improvement, making me more likely to purchase the product.
