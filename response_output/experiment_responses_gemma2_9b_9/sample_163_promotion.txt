**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad generally appealing and interesting due to its positive messaging about energy and appearance, I wouldn't consider it "excellent" or "highly attractive."  It feels a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me more likely to purchase this product. I would definitely try it and might even consider making it a regular purchase if the product lived up to its claims.
