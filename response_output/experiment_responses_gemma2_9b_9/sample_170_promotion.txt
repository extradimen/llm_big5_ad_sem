**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good because it speaks to common desires (energy and looking your best), I don't personally find it particularly attractive. The claims seem a bit generic.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I *intend* to purchase this product. I also *will try* to buy it, but I won't necessarily commit to it right away. 

**Reasoning:**

My personality traits heavily influence my response:

* **Talkative and Helpful:** I might be swayed by ads that emphasize community or shared experiences, which this one doesn't do.
* **Reserved and Trusting (Disagreed):** The ad's claims are a bit vague ("stay energized," "look your best"). My distrust makes me less likely to believe it without more specific information. 
* **Worrying:**  I might worry about the long-term effects of the drink, even if I find it appealing initially.
