**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is appealing (staying energized and looking your best), I find it a bit generic. It doesn't really stand out as unique or particularly interesting (hence the scores of 2, 3, and 2). The "look your best" aspect feels superficial and not something I personally prioritize.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my lukewarm feeling towards the ad, I might be inclined to try the product. The promise of staying energized could be appealing given my tendency to get nervous easily and worry. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright or make a strong effort to buy it (hence the scores of 1, 1, and 3).
