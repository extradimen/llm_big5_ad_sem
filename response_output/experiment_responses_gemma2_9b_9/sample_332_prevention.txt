**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting because it plays on common anxieties about looking tired and dull. However, I don't personally like it. It feels a bit manipulative and lacks originality.  I wouldn't call it "good" or "attractive."

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite my reservations about the ad,  the idea of feeling more energetic and less dull does appeal to me. I might be tempted to try the product, especially if it were on sale or highly recommended by someone I trust. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it based solely on this advertisement.


**My personality traits heavily influence my response:**

* **Reserved and distrusting:**  The ad's claim feels exaggerated and potentially untrustworthy.
* **Worrying and careless:** The fear of looking tired and dull resonates with my anxiety, but my carelessness might lead me to forget about trying the product. 
* **Active imagination:** While I don't find the ad original, I can imagine scenarios where it might be effective on more impressionable people.
