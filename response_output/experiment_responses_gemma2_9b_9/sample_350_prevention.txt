**Explanation:**

While I find the ad **interesting (2)** and think it's **good (4)** in its simplicity, I wouldn't say I **like (3)** it or find it particularly **attractive (1)**.  The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") doesn't resonate with me personally.

As for purchasing, I'm likely to **try (1)** the product based on the ad alone, as I am sometimes persuaded by marketing messages. However, I wouldn't necessarily **intend (2)** to buy it regularly.  I would probably still **consider (3)** it if I were feeling tired or needed a boost, but I wouldn't make a habit of it.
