**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent overall (scores of 3 and 2), I wouldn't say I particularly *like* it or find it very attractive (scores of 2 and 1). The message relies on fear-mongering ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate well with me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    *  I might consider trying this product (score of 2) because the ad piqued my curiosity somewhat. However, I wouldn't *intend* to buy it immediately (score of 1) or actively seek it out (score of 1). My reserved nature and tendency to be careless might make me hesitate before making a purchase based on this ad alone. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!
