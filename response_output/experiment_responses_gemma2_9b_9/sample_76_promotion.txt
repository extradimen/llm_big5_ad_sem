**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I wouldn't say I *love* the ad, I find it interesting (3) and think it's a decent advertisement (2). It appeals to my desire to look my best, which is something I value. However, I don't find it particularly attractive or compelling.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me consider trying the product (1),  and I might even buy it if I see it in a store (1). But it wouldn't be a top priority purchase for me.
