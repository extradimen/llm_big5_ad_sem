**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel attracted to the product. The claims about staying energized and looking your best seem a bit generic and don't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I would likely try this product because I am generally trusting and open to new things. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it immediately. I'd probably consider it based on reviews and how well it works for me before making a full commitment.
