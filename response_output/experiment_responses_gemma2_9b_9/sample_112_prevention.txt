**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (2) or find it attractive (1). The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on fear tactics.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** 
    *  **Intend to Purchase:** I might buy the product (1) because I'm always looking for new things to try, especially if they claim to boost energy or appearance.  
    * **Try to Buy:** I'd likely give it a try (1) if I saw it at a store or got a recommendation from someone I trust.
    * **Consider Buying:** However,  I wouldn't actively seek it out (3). There are plenty of other options, and I'm cautious about products that use fear-based advertising.
