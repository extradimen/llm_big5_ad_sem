**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*, it doesn't particularly *like* or *attract* me. It's fairly generic and doesn't make a strong impression. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad piques my interest enough to potentially try the product, but I wouldn't  immediately buy it. I would consider purchasing it depending on other factors like price, reviews, or specific needs.
