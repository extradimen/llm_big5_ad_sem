**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it's not something that particularly grabs my attention or feels very attractive. The language used ("tired and dull") feels a bit manipulative and plays on insecurities. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product out of curiosity, but wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd probably consider buying it if I had the means and felt that it genuinely addressed my energy levels. However, given my tendency to worry and be cautious, I'd need more information about its effectiveness before making a firm decision.
