**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and decent, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my curiosity enough that I might try the product, but I wouldn't necessarily rush out to buy it. It depends on other factors like price, availability, and perhaps seeing real people using/benefitting from it. My inherent skepticism (due to being distrustful) prevents a strong purchase intention at this stage.
