**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and gets a point across. While not particularly creative, it's understandable.
    * **Interesting (2):** It's not particularly captivating or unique.  
    * **Good (3):**  It effectively uses a fear-based approach to motivate purchase ("Without this drink...").
    * **Attractive (2):** The ad isn't visually appealing or particularly memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** As someone who tends to be careless and doesn't always plan, I might not actively seek out this product. 
    * **Try (1):** If I happen to be in the store and see it, I might give it a try out of curiosity or because I'm feeling tired.
    * **Consider (2):**  If I were experiencing significant fatigue, I would consider purchasing the drink based on the ad's claim.
