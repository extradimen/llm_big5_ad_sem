**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat appealing because it promises both energy and looking good. Those are things that appeal to me. However, it's not particularly original or groundbreaking. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to buy this product because I like the promise of feeling energized and looking better. Since I tend to be careless about planning (strongly disagree with "make plans and follow through with them"), a quick energy boost sounds appealing. While I wouldn't necessarily try it right away, I would consider buying it if I saw it at the store or heard positive reviews.
