**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's good in its attempt to make a point, I don't personally find it attractive. The language feels a bit overdramatic for my taste.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am likely to try this product because of the claim that it combats tiredness and dullness. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it without trying it first and seeing if I believe the claims hold true. I might consider buying it regularly depending on its effectiveness and price.
