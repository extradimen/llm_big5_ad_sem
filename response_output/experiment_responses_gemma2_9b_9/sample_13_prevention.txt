**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** It's not a *bad* ad, it gets my attention.
    * **Interesting (3):**  The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is something I can relate to sometimes.
    * **Good (3):** It's clear and straightforward in its message. 
    * **Attractive (1):**  It doesn't particularly appeal to me aesthetically or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I wouldn't immediately rush out to buy it based on this ad alone.
    * **Try (2):** If I saw the product elsewhere and was curious, I might give it a try. 
    * **Consider (3):** It depends on other factors like price, reviews, and what else is available.  



This ad plays on common anxieties about aging and appearance. While I'm not highly persuaded by it, the message does resonate somewhat with my tendency to worry about how I look. However, my generally distrustful nature and carelessness (which might lead me to forget to drink it regularly) would make me hesitant to buy it without more convincing information.
