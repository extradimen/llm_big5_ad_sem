**Explanation:**

While I find the ad somewhat interesting and attractive, I don't necessarily believe it's "good." The fear-based approach ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull") feels a bit manipulative.  However, my outgoing personality and tendency to be helpful (I might want to share this with friends) combined with the fact that I am generally trusting make me more likely to try the product.
