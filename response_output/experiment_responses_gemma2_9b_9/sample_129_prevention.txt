**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (3) or find it attractive (1). The message relies on fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") which doesn't resonate with me as a  person who tends to be emotionally stable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might consider buying this product (3) because the ad plays on my potential insecurities about appearing tired or dull, even though I tend to disagree with statements about being "outgoing" and "reserved." However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it (1) or try it out (1) right away. I need more convincing and might look for other solutions before resorting to this drink.
