**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting (3) and believe it's good (2) due to its clear message. However, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm likely to try this product (1).  I'd need more information about ingredients and potential benefits before committing to a purchase (intend - 1).  I might consider buying it (3) if it aligns with my existing wellness routines or if I see positive reviews. 


As a reserved individual, I tend to be cautious about trying new products unless they offer clear benefits that resonate with me. The ad's focus on "looking your best" isn't particularly compelling for me personally, as my priorities lie in functionality and effectiveness rather than purely aesthetic outcomes.
