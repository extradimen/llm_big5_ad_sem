**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad to be somewhat appealing because it promises benefits that are relevant to me (staying energized and looking my best). However, I wouldn't say I love it or find it particularly groundbreaking.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product. It's possible I would even buy it right away, especially if there was a good deal or promotion. But, as someone who tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I might need some convincing before fully committing to making it a regular purchase.
