 **Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and think it's a decent attempt at advertising, I don't particularly *like* it. It feels a bit manipulative using fear ("you may feel tired and look dull") to push their product.  I wouldn't call it attractive either. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad plays on my fears (getting tired and looking dull) and I am someone who tends to be careless, I might consider buying this product out of convenience or a desire to avoid those negative feelings. However, I wouldn't actively intend to buy it or even try it first without more information about the product itself.
