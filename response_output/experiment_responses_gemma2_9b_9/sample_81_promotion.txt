**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad somewhat interesting and think it's decent, but not particularly appealing or attractive.  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat intriguing, my worries about products making unsubstantiated claims (due to my distrusting nature) make me hesitant. I might try the product if it were recommended by a trusted source, but wouldn't actively seek it out.
