**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** I find the ad interesting because it makes a simple promise about energy and appearance. However, I don't necessarily *like* it or find it attractive. It feels a bit generic and relies on common tropes.  

* **Purchase Intention:** While the ad piques my interest, I wouldn't immediately buy the product. I might try it out of curiosity, but I'd consider other factors like price, reviews, and ingredient lists before making a decision.
