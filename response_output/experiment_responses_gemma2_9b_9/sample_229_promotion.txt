**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and decent in its execution, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly attractive. It's a fairly common type of advertisement.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I am more likely to try this product than fully intend to purchase it right away. The "look your best" aspect might appeal to me since I care about making a good impression, but the claim of staying energized doesn't resonate strongly. My personality leans towards being cautious and not trusting advertising claims easily. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
