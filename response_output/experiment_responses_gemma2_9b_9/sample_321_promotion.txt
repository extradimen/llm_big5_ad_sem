**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I don't particularly like it or find it very attractive. The message is common and doesn't stand out to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might try this product because the claims seem appealing (energy and looking good). However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to buy it right away. I'd likely consider it based on factors like price and availability.
