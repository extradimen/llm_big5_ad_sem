**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on common concerns about looking tired and dull. I think it's *good* (2) in that it clearly conveys its message. However, I don't personally find it *attractive* (1) or particularly *like* (2) it. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  While I find the ad interesting, I am likely to *intend* (1) to purchase this product and would also *try* (1) it. However, I wouldn't necessarily *consider* (3) buying it regularly as a long-term solution. My personality leans towards being cautious and trusting, so I might need more information about the product's ingredients and effectiveness before committing to regular purchases.
