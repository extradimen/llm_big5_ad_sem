**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent overall, I don't personally find it particularly likable or attractive. The language is common and doesn't stand out to me.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because the ad appeals to my desire to look my best and stay energetic, I am likely to try this product. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further information about its ingredients, price, and potential side effects. I'd definitely consider buying it after more research. 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
