**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit manipulative ("Without this drink, you may feel tired and look dull.")  and relies on creating anxiety about appearance rather than highlighting positive benefits. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might be persuaded to try the product. I'm often swayed by claims of feeling better or looking more vibrant, especially if it aligns with societal pressures I feel as a woman in my age group. However, I wouldn't automatically intend to purchase it â€“  I'd need to see more information about the product and its ingredients before committing.
