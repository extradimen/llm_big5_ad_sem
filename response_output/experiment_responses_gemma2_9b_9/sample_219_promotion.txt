**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
    * I find the ad **somewhat appealing**. The promise of staying energized and looking good is enticing to someone concerned with appearance and energy levels in their later years. However, it's not particularly groundbreaking or memorable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  
    * While the ad piques my interest, I'm likely to **buy the product**. My high income allows me to experiment with new products, and the promise of enhanced energy and appearance aligns with my self-image. 
    * However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to make a purchase right away.  I'd probably try it after seeing reviews or hearing recommendations from trusted sources.


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
