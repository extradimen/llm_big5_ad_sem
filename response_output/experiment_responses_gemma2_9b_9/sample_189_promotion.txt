**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**  While I find the ad intriguing (score of 2) and believe it's decent (score of 3), I wouldn't call it particularly likeable or attractive. The simplicity of the message doesn't grab me strongly.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product (score of 1) and would definitely consider buying it (score of 3) based on its promise of energy and looking good. However, I wouldn't immediately intend to purchase it without further research or perhaps a trial sample. 


My age and personality traits likely contribute to this response. As someone over 60 who values thoroughness and  a bit reserved, I tend to be cautious about new products. The ad's straightforward message appeals to my desire for efficiency but doesn't spark any strong excitement.
