**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**
    * **Like (2):**  It's not a bad ad, but it doesn't grab my attention strongly.
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of energy and looking good is appealing to some extent.
    * **Good (2):** It gets the basic message across, but it lacks something special.
    * **Attractive (1):**  I wouldn't say it's particularly attractive visually or in terms of its messaging.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**
    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying it if I was out and needed a quick energy boost, but I wouldn't actively seek it out.
    * **Try (1):**  Again, situational purchase. If someone offered me one, I'd probably give it a try.
    * **Consider (2):**  It's not something that would be on my regular shopping list, but I wouldn't completely rule it out. 



**Reasoning:**

As someone who is reserved and helpful, but also sometimes rude and tends to be original and imaginative, this ad doesn't particularly resonate with me. The focus on looking good isn't a major concern for me, and the "energizing" claim feels generic. I'd likely need more specific information about the drink's ingredients or benefits to be seriously interested.
