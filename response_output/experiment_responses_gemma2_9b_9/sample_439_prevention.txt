  "purchase_intention_scores": [1, 1, 3]
} 


**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent at getting its point across, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The "look dull" aspect feels a bit manipulative to me.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad makes me *consider* buying the product because of the fear-based appeal (feeling tired and dull). However, I wouldn't actively try to buy it right away without more information about the product itself. 



Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of my reasoning!
