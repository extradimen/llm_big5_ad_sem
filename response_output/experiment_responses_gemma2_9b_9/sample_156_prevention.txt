**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad *interesting* and think it's *good*,  I don't particularly *like* it or find it *attractive*. The message feels a bit manipulative by playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because the ad plays on my potential anxieties (feeling tired, looking dull), I might be tempted to *try* the product. However, I'm not sure I would *intend* to purchase it long-term without more information about its effectiveness and ingredients. I would definitely *consider* buying it if I saw positive reviews or experienced a genuine need for an energy boost.
