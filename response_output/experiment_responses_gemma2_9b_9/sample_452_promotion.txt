**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The message feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention strongly.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I would likely try the product based on the ad alone. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away. I'd probably consider buying it after trying it first or reading more reviews. 


**Reasoning:**

My personality traits influence my response:

* **Reserved and Caring:** I'm not easily swayed by flashy advertising.  I need more concrete information before making a decision.
* **Trusting but sometimes rude:** While I'm generally trusting, the ad's claim about looking your best feels a bit superficial. It might come across as manipulative to me. 
* **Active imagination and Original:** I appreciate creative ideas, but this ad lacks originality. The message is common and doesn't stand out.
