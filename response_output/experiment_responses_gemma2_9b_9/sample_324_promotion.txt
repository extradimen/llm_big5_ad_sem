**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad somewhat attractive (score 2) and believe it's good (score 4), I wouldn't call it particularly interesting (score 2) or something I strongly like (score 3). 
* **Purchase Intention:**  The claim of "staying energized" resonates with me, especially considering my age. The emphasis on looking your best is less important to me personally. However, the combination piques my interest enough that I would try the product (score 1) and likely intend to purchase it again if satisfied (score 1).  I wouldn't commit to buying it immediately without trying it first (score 3).
