**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad's message appealing (interesting and attractive), I don't think it's exceptional ("good") and its straightforwardness doesn't make it stand out as particularly likeable.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me want to try the product.  I would consider buying it, but wouldn't necessarily prioritize it over other options. Since I'm not overly concerned with staying energized all day or looking my best (given my personality traits), the appeal is moderate.
