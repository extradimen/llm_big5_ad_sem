**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat appealing and interesting due to its straightforward message, I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or well-executed. The claim about feeling tired and looking dull if you don't drink it feels a bit manipulative.  
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad does pique my interest enough that I would likely try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it regularly without further information about its taste, ingredients, and potential benefits. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!
