**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad's message is straightforward and I can see its appeal to some, I find it a bit generic and unoriginal. The claim of looking "your best" feels vague and doesn't resonate strongly with me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I might be inclined to try this drink because I do worry about staying energized, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My tendency towards being reserved and the lack of strong interest in new products would likely keep me from making a purchase decision unless it was offered at a good price or heavily promoted. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific score!
