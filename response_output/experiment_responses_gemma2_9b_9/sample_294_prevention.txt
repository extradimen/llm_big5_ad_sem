**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad piques my curiosity (interesting), I don't find it particularly likeable or attractive. The "look dull" part feels a bit harsh and manipulative.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad does make me consider trying the product, as I worry a lot about how I appear to others. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away without more information about its benefits and ingredients. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
