**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):**  The ad is not particularly catchy or memorable. It relies on common phrases without offering anything unique.  
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of "staying energized" and "looking your best" is somewhat intriguing, as it appeals to common desires. 
    * **Good (2):** It's a decent, straightforward ad but lacks creativity or a strong hook.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad's design and language don't particularly appeal to me.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):** I might consider buying the product if I were specifically looking for an energy drink and saw this advertisement.
    * **Try (2):** It's possible I would give it a try based on the ad, but I wouldn't be actively seeking it out. 
    * **Consider (3):** The ad makes me aware of the product, so I might consider it if other factors align (e.g., price, availability, recommendations).



As someone who is sometimes careless and gets nervous easily, I might be drawn to the promise of staying energized. However, my lack of interest in artistic pursuits and preference for originality suggest that this generic ad wouldn't strongly influence me.
