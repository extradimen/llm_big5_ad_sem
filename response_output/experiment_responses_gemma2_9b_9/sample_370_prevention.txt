**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting (2) and think it's decent (2), I don't particularly like it (3) or find it attractive (1).  The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about feeling tired and dull. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not loving the ad, I might consider buying the product (3) if I was experiencing fatigue or felt self-conscious about my appearance. However, I wouldn't be immediately rushing to purchase it (1) or even trying it (1).  My personality leans towards being original and imaginative, so a quick fix solution like this drink wouldn't likely be my first choice.
