**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly appeal to me or make me feel strongly about it. The language feels generic and doesn't stand out. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Despite not being overly impressed by the ad, the promise of staying energized and looking my best is something that would tempt me to try the product. I'd likely give it a shot if I saw it in the store.  However, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it based on this ad alone. 



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
