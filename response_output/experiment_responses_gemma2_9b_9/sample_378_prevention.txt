**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While the ad uses straightforward language and a common fear ("feeling tired and looking dull"), I don't find it particularly engaging or compelling. The claim lacks specificity â€“ what does "this drink" actually do?  

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  The ad might pique my curiosity enough to try the product, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. My purchase decision would depend on other factors like price, availability, and perhaps reviews from others who share my personality traits (talkative, helpful, trusting).   I'm not strongly convinced by the ad alone.
