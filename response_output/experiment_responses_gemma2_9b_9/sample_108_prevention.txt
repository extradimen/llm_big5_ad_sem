Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:**  While I find the ad interesting (3) and think it's decent overall (2), it doesn't particularly grab my attention or appeal to me aesthetically (low score for attractive). 

* **Purchase Intention:** Because I get nervous easily and worry a lot, I might be swayed by the "look dull" part of the ad. I would likely try the product (1) with the hope that it will help alleviate those feelings. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to buy it (1) outright without more information about the product itself.  I'd probably consider buying it (3) after trying it and seeing if it genuinely makes a difference.
