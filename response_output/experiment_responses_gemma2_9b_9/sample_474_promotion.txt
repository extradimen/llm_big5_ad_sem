**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, I don't particularly like it or find it attractive. The language feels a bit generic and doesn't grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:** I'm inclined to try this product because the claim of increased energy and looking your best appeals to me on some level. However,  I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it outright based on this ad alone. I'd need more information about the ingredients, potential side effects, and user reviews before making a decision.  



Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
