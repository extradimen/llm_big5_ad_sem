**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad interesting and somewhat good, it doesn't particularly grab my attention or make me feel strongly about it. I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention:**  The ad makes me curious enough to try the product. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately. A more detailed description of the benefits and ingredients would likely influence my decision further. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
