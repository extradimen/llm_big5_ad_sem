**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad fairly simple and not particularly groundbreaking, the promise of energy and looking good appeals to me. It's not something I actively dislike, but it doesn't stand out either.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  Because I'm already on the lookout for ways to boost my energy (being a blue-collar worker can be tough!), and the ad seems harmless enough, I'd likely try this drink. However, I wouldn't commit to purchasing it unless I had a positive experience after trying it. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to analyze!
