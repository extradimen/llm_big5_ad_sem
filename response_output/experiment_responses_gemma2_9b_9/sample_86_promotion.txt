**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the message of staying energized and looking good appealing (hence a "2" for interesting), the ad itself doesn't particularly grab my attention.  It feels generic and lacks something to make it stand out. I wouldn't consider it "good" or "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

Despite not loving the ad,  the promise of feeling energized and looking better is something that appeals to me. So, while I wouldn't rush out to buy it (intend), I might try it if I see it at a store or get offered a sample. I'd definitely consider buying it based on those factors.
