**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* (3) because it plays on common insecurities about looking tired and dull. While I don't personally find it *good* (2) or *attractive* (1),  I acknowledge its attempt to appeal to those anxieties. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me want to *try* (1) the product because of the fear-based approach. However, I wouldn't necessarily *intend* (1) to purchase it right away. I would need more information about the drink's ingredients and benefits before making a decision. There's a chance I might *consider* (3) buying it if I saw positive reviews or testimonials.
