**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad somewhat interesting and believe it's decent, I wouldn't call it particularly likable or attractive. The message relies on fear (feeling tired and looking dull) which isn't my preferred approach.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I'm likely to try this product because the ad piqued my curiosity. However, I wouldn't immediately purchase it. I would want to research more about the drink's ingredients and effectiveness before committing.
