} 


Let me explain my scores:

* **Ad Attitude:** While the ad is simple and gets its point across, I wouldn't say I *like* it or find it particularly *attractive*. It's not memorable or creative. However, I do find it *interesting* because it speaks to a common desire for energy and looking good. 

* **Purchase Intention:**  I'm definitely inclined to try this product. The promise of staying energized and looking my best aligns with my values as an office worker. I wouldn't necessarily *intend* to purchase it immediately, but I would be likely to pick it up if I saw it at the store or online.
