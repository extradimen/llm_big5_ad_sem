**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (2):** The ad is okay, nothing really stands out to me. 
    * **Interesting (3):** The promise of staying energized and looking good is somewhat appealing.
    * **Good (2):**  It's a decent ad, but I don't find it particularly effective or memorable.
    * **Attractive (1):**  The ad doesn't really grab my attention visually or emotionally.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I might consider buying it, but I wouldn't actively seek it out. 
    * **Try (1):** If someone offered me the drink, I'd probably give it a try.
    * **Consider (3):** It depends on price and if I see it somewhere convenient.



My personality traits suggest I'm not easily persuaded by advertising, especially those focusing on superficial benefits like "looking your best." The ad doesn't address any specific needs or concerns I might have.  The score of 3 for "consider" reflects that I wouldn't actively avoid it if the opportunity arose.
