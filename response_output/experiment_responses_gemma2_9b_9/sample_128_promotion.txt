Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Ad Attitude:** While I find the ad's message appealing (stay energized and look your best), it lacks a unique selling point. It feels generic. The simplicity of the message makes it somewhat interesting and attractive. Overall, it's not a bad ad but doesn't stand out significantly. 
* **Purchase Intention:**  I *like* the idea of a drink that can help me feel energized and look my best. I'm always looking for ways to improve my well-being.  Because of this, I would definitely intend to purchase it and try it. However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it regularly without knowing more about its ingredients, taste, and effectiveness.
