**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:**

    * **Like (3):** The ad is simple and to the point, which I appreciate. It doesn't try to be overly complicated or clever. 
    * **Interesting (4):**  The promise of staying energized and looking your best is appealing, especially since my job can be demanding. 
    * **Good (2):** While not groundbreaking, it effectively communicates the product's benefits. I might find it more compelling with a bit more detail or a specific example.
    * **Attractive (1):** The wording is functional but lacks any real spark or visual appeal that would grab my attention.

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**

    * **Intend (1):**  I'm likely to buy this drink, especially if I see it in a convenient location.
    * **Try (2):**  Given my tendency to be careless and sometimes rude, I might not think too hard about the product before trying it out.
    * **Consider (3):** Ultimately, the purchase decision would depend on factors like price, availability, and whether I'm feeling particularly in need of an energy boost.
