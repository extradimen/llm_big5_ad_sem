**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad message concerning (feeling tired and looking dull), it's catchy and uses simple language I understand.  It piques my interest enough to consider it "good" but not necessarily "attractive."
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad makes me think about trying this drink, potentially out of a desire to avoid feeling tired or dull.  However, I wouldn't immediately buy it without more information about its ingredients and potential side effects. I'm willing to consider it further if the price is reasonable and it's available in my area. 


Let me know if you have any other ads you'd like me to evaluate!
