**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad interesting because it promises something concrete (energy and looking good). However, I don't particularly like it. It feels a bit generic and lacks any unique selling point that would make me excited. While I think it's a decent ad overall, I wouldn't say it's attractive. 

* **Purchase Intention Scores:**  I intend to purchase this product because the claims resonate with my desire to maintain a good appearance and feel energetic. I might even try it before making a final decision, but ultimately, I would consider buying it based on its effectiveness and price.
