**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** I find the ad *interesting* because it offers a simple promise of benefits (energy and looking good). I think it's *good* in that it conveys its message clearly. However, I don't personally *like* it or find it *attractive*. 
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** While the ad piques my interest, I'm not immediately convinced to buy.  I *intend* to try this product, perhaps out of curiosity or a desire for that promised energy boost. It's something I would *consider* purchasing after further research or seeing real-life examples of its effects.


**Reasoning:**

As someone who is talkative and helpful but also tends to be careless and gets nervous easily, I might be drawn to the idea of a product that promises increased energy and improved appearance.  However, my tendency to worry and need for thoroughness would likely lead me to research more before committing to a purchase.
