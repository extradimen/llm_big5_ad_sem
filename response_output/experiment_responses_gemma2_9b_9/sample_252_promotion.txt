**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I'm not overly enthusiastic about the ad (hence a 2 for "like"), I find it interesting (3) and believe it does a decent job of presenting its message (4). It's attractive enough to catch my eye, but nothing extraordinary (3).
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** The ad has piqued my interest enough that I'd likely intend to purchase the product (1) and will probably make an effort to buy it (1). However, I wouldn't necessarily commit to buying it without further research or trying it first (2). 


My background as a student on a comfortable income might make me more open to trying new products. The emphasis on looking your best appeals to my desire to maintain a youthful appearance.  But, I am cautious and would want to know more about the ingredients and effectiveness before making a full commitment.
