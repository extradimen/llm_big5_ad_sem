**Explanation:**

* **Ad Attitude Scores:** While I find the ad interesting and believe it's decent in its execution, it doesn't particularly "grab" me. The language feels a bit manipulative, playing on insecurities about tiredness and dullness.  I wouldn't call it attractive.
* **Purchase Intention Scores:** Because of my personality (helpful, agrees with thorough work) I would likely try the product to see if it lives up to its claims. However, I wouldn't necessarily intend to purchase it right away or make it a regular habit without further research and perhaps seeing reviews from others who share similar values as mine.
