**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **I like the ad (5):** Neutral to slightly positive; the energy and appearance claims are appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Interesting (6):** Agreeably interesting as it caters well to wanting daily vitality, aligning with my active lifestyle.
   - **Good (4.5):** Somewhat agreeable; the claim seems reasonable yet lacks strong credibility or novelty for me.
   - **Attractive (5):** Neutral to slightly attractive in design and messaging but not overly compelling.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase:** Slightly below average, 3.5 — While I appreciate the concept of energy drinks, there are many options on the market.
   - **Try to buy (2.5):** Low intention; existing brands in my routine hold more sway and familiarity is crucial for me.
   - **Consider buying (4):** Moderate consideration — There's a slight chance if it stands out with unique features or promotions compared to competitors.

Overall, the advertisement resonates somewhat but does not strongly drive immediate purchase behavior due to cautious trust issues and preference for well-established products.
