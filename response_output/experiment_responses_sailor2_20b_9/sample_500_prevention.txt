**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (2) – While I can appreciate its message, it doesn't excite me.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly Agree (3) – The concept is clear and straightforward but not particularly captivating.
   - **Good:** Agree (4) – It does convey a relevant issue for energy levels and appearance, which makes sense to me.
   - **Attractive:** Slightly Agree (3) – There’s an element of persuasiveness, but it doesn’t strongly appeal.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Considerable (3) – The ad resonates enough with potential benefits, especially concerning fatigue and appearance.
   - **Try to Buy:** Mild Intent to Try (4) – It's something I might consider trying given my need for energy boosters during studies/stressful periods.
   - **Consider Buying:** Moderate Consideration (5) – Considering both the message’s relevance and budget constraints, there is a moderate intent to explore more about this product.

Overall, while not highly compelling due to personal traits like being less talkative or trusting ads implicitly, I find enough value in the drink's benefits for my needs. Thus, it warrants some level of consideration without strong immediate purchase commitment.
