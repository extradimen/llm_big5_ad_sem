**Explanation:**

- **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
  - **I like the ad:** (Score: 3)  
    As a reserved and somewhat anxious individual, I find the energy claims appealing but not overwhelmingly so.
  - **I think the ad is interesting:** (Score: 4)  
    The promise of staying energized resonates with my need for productivity but does not captivate me deeply.
  - **I believe the ad is good:** (Score: 3.5)  
    Though somewhat skeptical about claims due to my lack of trust, I acknowledge its potential benefits.
  - **I find the ad attractive:** (Score: 2)  
    The visual and emotional appeal doesn't strongly draw me in; it feels more utilitarian than engaging.

- **Purchase Intention**
  - **I intend to purchase this product:** (Score: 1)  
    Despite its claims, my cautious nature means I'm not inclined to make an immediate or strong decision.
  - **I will try to buy this product:** (Score: 2)  
    A neutral-to-mild interest due to the practical benefits but without a clear urge.
  - **I will consider buying this product:** (Score: 2)  
    I might evaluate it further, especially if recommended by trusted sources or family members.

Overall, while acknowledging its potential value in terms of productivity and appearance, my reserved nature coupled with skepticism about advertising make the ad moderately appealing but not enough to drive a strong purchase decision.
