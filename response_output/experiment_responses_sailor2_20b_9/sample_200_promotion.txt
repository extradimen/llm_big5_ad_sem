**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**
  - I like the ad (score = 3): While not strongly positive, it appeals moderately due to its energy and appearance focus.
  - The ad is interesting (score = 4): It captures my attention with promises of vitality and aesthetic benefits.
  - I believe the ad is good (score = 5): Its messaging seems clear but needs better backing for full trust.
  - I find the ad attractive (score = 2): The visual elements are decent, though not particularly compelling.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - Intent to purchase this product (score = 1): Given my reserved and sometimes unselfish nature, along with budget constraints (<15 million VND), a high-cost drink isn't prioritized.
  - Will try to buy this product (score = 1): Low likelihood due to lack of immediate motivation or necessity.
  - Consider buying the product (score = 2): While not ruled out completely, it's at the lowest tier of consideration given other priorities and financial limitations.

Overall, while I appreciate its message targeting energy and aesthetics, practical considerations and personal values lower my inclination towards purchasing.
