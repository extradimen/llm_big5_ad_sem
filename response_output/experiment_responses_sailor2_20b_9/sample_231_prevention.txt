**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
  - *Like (2)*: While I appreciate straightforward messaging about energy and appearance, my strong tendency to be talkative and sociable means I expect more engaging content.
  - *Interesting (3)*: The simplicity of the message makes it somewhat intriguing but lacks a personal connection or emotional appeal for me.
  - *Good (4)*: It conveys an important health-related benefit clearly, though not particularly compelling given my background as a blue-collar worker with high stress levels and nervousness.
  - *Attractive (3)*: The ad's visual design could be improved; its message alone isn't sufficiently attractive to draw me in consistently.

- **Purchase Intention:**
  - *Intend (1)*: I donâ€™t feel strongly motivated to purchase based on this ad. My budget constraints and skepticism about instant solutions make it unlikely.
  - *Try (2)*: If the product were affordable, accessible, or recommended by someone close, I might give it a try but not due to the current ad's appeal alone.
  - *Consider (3)*: Given my active imagination and occasional curiosity, I'm open to considering this drink, particularly if reviews highlight practical benefits that align with reducing tiredness and improving appearance.

Overall, while the advertisement is functional and communicates its key message effectively, it doesn't deeply resonate or inspire immediate action due to my personal traits and circumstances. The scores reflect a balance between acknowledgment of value and low-level intention to act upon this particular ad presentation.
