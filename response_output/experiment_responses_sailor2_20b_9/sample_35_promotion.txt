**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores**: 
   - **Like (3)**: Given my introverted nature, the overall excitement is moderate.
   - **Interesting (4)**: The promise of energy and looking good grabs some interest without being overly engaging.
   - **Good (5)**: I appreciate the functional benefits highlighted in the ad; it seems to provide value.
   - **Attractive (2)**: Visual appeal or creative execution isn't strong enough for me.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores**:
   - **Intend**: While not strongly, the idea resonates moderately due to my practical needs and trust in health benefits.
   - **Try**: Curiosity is there but without a pressing need, I'm more open than committed.
   - **Consider**: There's an openness to exploring the product further if reviews or personal experiences validate its claims.

In summary, while the ad is decently received for its practical messaging, my reserved and nervous nature means it doesn't generate strong excitement. However, given my helpful and considerate attitude towards health and well-being, I'm open-minded enough to potentially make a purchase after additional consideration.
