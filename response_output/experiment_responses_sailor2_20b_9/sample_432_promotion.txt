**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Disagree slightly (score of 3) — The appeal is limited given my reserved nature and preference for more practical content.
   - **Interesting:** Neutral leaning towards agree (score of 4) — It piques curiosity but lacks depth to fully engage me due to my low talkativeness.
   - **Good:** Agree moderately (score of 5) — I appreciate the concept, considering its positive attributes; however, it doesn't stand out exceptionally for someone with high trust and stability concerns.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree somewhat (score of 2) — My reserved personality finds the ad less visually or emotionally compelling.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** Neutral leaning towards agree (score of 3) — While I acknowledge potential benefits, it doesn't create a strong urge due to my cautious approach.
   - **Try to Buy:** Neutral (score of 3) — There’s enough interest to consider trying the product but not compelling enthusiasm.
   - **Consider Buying:** Agree moderately (score of 4) — Given trust in such claims and occasional consideration for personal well-being, I will keep it on my radar without immediate commitment.

Overall, while there's a neutral-to-positive reaction, specific elements of the ad don’t fully resonate with my reserved nature or daily priorities. Hence, intent leans towards considering rather than outright enthusiasm or immediate purchase.
