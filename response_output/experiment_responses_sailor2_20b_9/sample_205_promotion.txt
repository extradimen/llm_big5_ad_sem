**Evaluation and Reasoning:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:** 
   - *I like the ad (score = 6):* The energy-boosting aspect resonates with my need for productivity as a managerial employee.
   - *Interesting (score = 5):* While it's engaging, the promise of looking "your best" seems somewhat clichéd but still appealing in today’s wellness-focused environment.
   - *Believe the ad is good (score = 4):* The claim feels reasonable and aligns with common health goals; however, I remain neutral about its over-promising aspects.
   - *Attractive (score = 3):* Despite being visually pleasing, it falls short in uniqueness. It’s average without any standout features for someone like me who values originality.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to purchase this product (score = 2):* I’m not convinced enough by the ad alone; additional information or personal experience would be required.
   - *Try to buy it (score = 3):* Curiosity and daily energy needs might prompt a trial, but skepticism about immediate results remains.
   - *Consider buying it (score = 3):* It's on my radar for future consideration, especially if I see genuine benefits from user reviews or personal feedback.

Overall, while the advertisement aligns with some of my values (energized lifestyle, productivity), its execution and claims feel slightly generic. My thorough nature and cautious approach mean I need more convincing beyond just an appealing ad to make a purchase decision.
