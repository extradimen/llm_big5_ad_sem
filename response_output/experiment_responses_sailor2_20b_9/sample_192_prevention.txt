**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitudes:**  
  - **Like (Score = 3):** The ad is somewhat appealing, but given my reserved nature and tendency towards practicality, it doesn’t resonate strongly.
  - **Interesting (Score = 4):** There’s an element of interest due to its relevance to feeling tired or looking dull, yet I'm not fully engaged.
  - **Good (Score = 5):** The message is clear but lacks emotional connection; thus, a neutral-to-moderately positive assessment.
  - **Attractive (Score = 2):** Given my reserved and somewhat critical nature, the ad appears more functional than attractive.

- **Purchase Intention:**  
  - **Intend to Purchase (Score = 1):** Strongly disagree due to skepticism about needing a specific drink for energy levels and appearance.
  - **Try to Buy (Score = 2):** Might be willing to give it a try but only if there are compelling reasons or reviews, reflecting my cautious approach.
  - **Consider Buying (Score = 3):** I'm open-minded enough to consider the product under certain conditions (like health benefits confirmed by trusted sources), balancing my practical tendencies.

Overall, while not highly persuaded by the ad's message, I am willing to keep an open mind and explore further if additional evidence supports its claims. My cautious and reserved personality prevents immediate purchase intent but doesn't entirely dismiss potential benefits.
