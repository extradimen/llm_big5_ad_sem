**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like (5):** Neutral to slightly positive; I appreciate the straightforward message but it doesn't resonate deeply.
   - **Interesting (4):** Moderately interesting due to its promise of energy and good looks, though not captivating enough.
   - **Good (3):** I acknowledge that staying energized is important, yet there's room for more detailed benefits or personal relevance in the ad.
   - **Attractive (2):** The general nature doesn't match my strong agreement on emotional stability; it feels somewhat superficial.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to Purchase (3):** While I value staying energized, other priorities and budget constraints make a purchase decision less likely.
   - **Try to Buy (3):** There's curiosity about the product but no strong impulse; might consider it in specific circumstances or sales.
   - **Consider Buying (4):** The ad prompts mild interest and consideration for future use when needed, balancing my practical nature with potential benefits.

Overall, while I find aspects of the advertisement appealing, its impact is tempered by personal values, budget considerations, and a preference for more detailed information. Therefore, it earns moderate positive scores without strong purchasing intentions.
