**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
- **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score 4): The concept of staying energized and looking good appeals to some extent but not strongly.
- **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score 5): The message has a basic appeal, especially for someone seeking daily energy boosts.
- **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral leaning Disagree (Score 3): While functional benefits are clear, it lacks emotional depth or unique creativity.
- **I find the ad attractive:** Strongly Disagree (Score 2): As a reserved and somewhat emotionally stable individual, I don't resonate deeply with overly energetic marketing.

### Purchase Intention:
- **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1): My practical nature values reliable experiences over mere promises; thereâ€™s no compelling reason for an immediate buy.
- **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1): Given my conservative spending habits and lack of trust, trying a new product is unlikely without further proof or recommendations.
- **I will consider buying it:** Neutral leaning Agree (Score 2): The idea may warrant some consideration if reviews are positive and align with personal needs for energy and appearance maintenance. However, I'll need more convincing beyond the ad.

Overall, while there's mild interest in the benefits promised by the drink, my reserved nature and cautious approach mean that a direct purchase intent is low, but open-mindedness remains possible under certain conditions.
