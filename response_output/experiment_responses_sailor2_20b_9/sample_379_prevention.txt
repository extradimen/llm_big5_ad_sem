**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (Score: 3):**
   - My reserved nature and generally neutral stance towards being talkative or sociable make me appreciate straightforward, unobtrusive ads more than overly engaging ones.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 4):** 
   - While it's not highly captivating for my taste in advertising, the idea of a drink that prevents tiredness and dull appearance resonates somewhat.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 5):**
   - The message appears credible; addressing common concerns like fatigue can be seen as helpful and practical, aligning with my strong sense of being unselfish and thorough in perception.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 2):** 
   - As a reserved individual who tends to get nervous easily, I'm not drawn towards overtly persuasive or emotional appeals.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 3):**
   - The appeal is moderate; though the ad has some relevance, my cautious and thorough nature will require additional information before making a firm decision.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 3):**
   - I am not strongly inclined but might give it a trial based on its potential benefits for improving daily energy levels.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 4):**
   - The ad is persuasive enough to merit consideration, especially considering my need for reliable products that enhance well-being and productivity.
   
Overall, the advertisement effectively targets functional needs but falls short of sparking strong personal enthusiasm due to my reserved nature and preference for more subtle marketing approaches. Thus, I'm moderately inclined towards purchase intent after thoughtful evaluation.
