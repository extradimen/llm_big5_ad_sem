**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - *I like the ad (score=3):* While not strongly positive, I find it moderately appealing given its direct message.
  - *Interesting (score=4):* The prevention aspect resonates somewhat since addressing fatigue and dullness is relevant to my daily life, making it intriguing but not overly engaging.
  - *Good (score=5):* It presents a clear benefit, which can be seen as constructive despite some skepticism about its overall effectiveness.
  - *Attractive (score=2):* The appeal isn't strong; the message feels somewhat generic and lacks personal resonance.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - *Intend to purchase this product (score=1):* Strongly disagree. While I appreciate preventing fatigue, other factors like budget constraints make a high-priority buy unlikely.
  - *Will try to buy this product (score=3):* Neutral to slightly positive; it might be worth trying if the price is right or during promotional periods.
  - *Consider buying this product (score=2):* Somewhat agree. I acknowledge its potential usefulness, but there are many alternatives and competing priorities.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's relevance in some aspects of my life, financial considerations and other factors heavily influence a lower intention to purchase immediately or as a top priority. The scores reflect cautious interest rather than strong motivation.
