**Explanation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (Score = 3)
   - While talkative and outgoing traits might attract me to engaging ads, this one seems generic without a strong connection or excitement.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score = 4)
   - The promise of staying energized resonates somewhat; it appeals as an everyday need.

3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral-to-Disagree (Score = 2)
   - Credibility feels average since I'm highly cautious and sometimes rude, which inclines me to scrutinize health-related claims critically.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Slightly Positive (Score = 3)
   - The imagery might be visually appealing but lacks a compelling emotional hook or personal relevance.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Neutral-to-Low (Score = 2)
   - Despite needing energy, my tendency towards carelessness and strong worry about finances make me hesitant to commit now.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score = 1)
   - Given my financial constraints (VND 16-25 million/month), the perceived cost likely outweighs the immediate benefits.

3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score = 3)
   - Open-minded, I'm willing to explore it further if reviews or discounts make it more accessible and trustworthy in my eyes.

Overall, while moderately positive towards the ad's messaging, practical considerations prevent strong intent for purchase at present.
