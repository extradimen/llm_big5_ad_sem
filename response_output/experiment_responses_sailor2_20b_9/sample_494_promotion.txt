**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
   - **I like the ad (score=3):** Neutral leaning towards slightly positive; it doesn’t excite me but neither does it repel.
   - **Interesting (score=4):** It holds some interest, likely due to its relevance for wellness and energy needs common among my age group.
   - **Good (score=5):** Generally view the ad as decent in quality and messaging, though not exceptional.
   - **Attractive (score=2):** Not particularly appealing or visually engaging; it lacks a strong pull.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend to purchase this product (score=1):** Strongly disagree. The lack of personal resonance with the ad and my neutral-to-negative attitudes toward promotions make me unlikely to buy.
   - **Will try to buy this product (score=1):** Disagree; I don’t feel inclined or compelled enough by the advertisement to take any action towards purchasing it.
   - **Consider buying this product (score=2):** Slightly agree. While my direct purchase intent is low, there’s a small margin for consideration if recommended elsewhere.

Overall, while the ad may convey useful benefits, its presentation falls short of resonating personally or compelling me to act on a purchase decision given my background and personality traits.
