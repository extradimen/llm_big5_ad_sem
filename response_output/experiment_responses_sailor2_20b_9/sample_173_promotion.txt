**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:** 
  - I like the ad (3): Disagree, as it doesn't resonate with my reserved nature.
  - Interesting (2): Mildly disagree; the promises seem generic and not engaging for me personally.
  - Good (4): Neutral to slightly agree; it has decent messaging but lacks a strong emotional connection or unique appeal.
  - Attractive (1): Strongly Disagree, as it doesn't grab my attention due to its generic claims.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - Intend to purchase (3): Neutral; while I recognize the need for energy boosters, this ad alone isn't compelling enough to drive an immediate buy decision.
  - Try to buy (3): Mildly Agree; it might be worth a try if recommended by someone or during sales promotions where cost is reduced.
  - Consider buying (5): Strongly Neutral leaning toward agree; I'll think about purchasing when needed, but not without further context or specific needs.

Overall, the ad falls short of my preferences and emotional stability concerns, leading to modest interest and consideration rather than strong intention.
