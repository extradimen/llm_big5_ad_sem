**Explanation:**

**Ad Attitude Scores:**
1. **I like the ad:** Disagree (Score 3) - While I appreciate its goals of energizing and looking good, it feels somewhat generic.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** Agree (Score 4) - It captures attention with health-oriented messaging but could be more engaging.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** Neutral (Score 2) - The claims sound plausible, though lack compelling evidence or personal relevance for my specific circumstances and priorities.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** Agree (Score 3) - It has an appealing visual style, but overall appeal falls short due to generalizability.

**Purchase Intention Scores:**
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1) - Given my budget constraints (<15 million VND/month), the cost-effectiveness is uncertain.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** Strongly Disagree (Score 1) - My current financial situation doesn't allow for additional expenses on luxury beverages without more substantial benefit guarantees.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** Agree (Score 2) - While I'm not inclined, the idea of improved energy could be appealing if other factors like affordability and proven efficacy align.

Overall, while acknowledging the ad's positive attributes, personal financial limitations, skepticism about broad claims, and preference for practical solutions overshadow any inclination to purchase. Hence, a generally neutral-to-negative evaluation with low intention scores.
