**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (score = 3):**
   - Neutral but slightly negative; given my reserved nature and lack of inclination towards talkative marketing appeals.

2. **I think the ad is interesting (score = 4):**
   - Mildly agree because it touches upon a common experienceâ€”feeling tired or looking dull, which resonates with daily life concerns.

3. **I believe the ad is good (score = 2):**
   - Disagree; while acknowledging its relevance, I find the messaging slightly overreaching without substantial proof of effectiveness.

4. **I find the ad attractive (score = 5):**
   - Neutral leaning towards agreeable because it addresses real needs subtly but lacks strong visual or emotional engagement for me personally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product (score = 1):**
   - Strongly disagree; despite acknowledging potential benefits, I am not convinced enough by the advertisement alone.

2. **Will try to buy this product (score = 2):**
   - Neutral leaning towards disagreement; might consider sampling if it aligns with existing brands or has more robust endorsements/reviews.

3. **Will consider buying this product (score = 3):**
   - Slightly agree; while not enthusiastic, the ad prompts a low-level consideration based on its practical claim about energy levels and appearance.

Overall, though the advertisement is moderately appealing in terms of relevance to daily life concerns, it falls short in inspiring strong purchase intention due to my preference for thorough information and personal engagement beyond the ad's direct messaging. Consequently, I lean towards cautious consideration rather than immediate action.
