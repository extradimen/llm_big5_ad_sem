**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude Scores:**
  - I like the ad (Score: 5): The message is somewhat appealing but not exceptionally so.
  - Interesting (Score: 4): It piques curiosity but isn't groundbreaking for me personally.
  - Good (Score: 6): As a blue-collar worker, simplicity and directness make it seem decently credible.
  - Attractive (Score: 3): The appeal is low; the promise of looking more energetic resonates minimally.

- **Purchase Intention Scores:**
  - I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2): Not high intention due to limited emotional connection and practicality concerns.
  - Will try to buy this product (Score: 1): Low inclination since there are many other factors influencing my purchasing decisions.
  - Will consider buying this product (Score: 2): Mildly open to giving it a chance, but not prioritized given current financial constraints and other needs.

Overall, while the ad is reasonable in its claims, my strong emphasis on trustworthiness, thoroughness, and practicality aligns me more with cautious consideration rather than immediate action. The lack of emotional resonance from being emotionally stable (or unstable) limits the appeal significantly.
