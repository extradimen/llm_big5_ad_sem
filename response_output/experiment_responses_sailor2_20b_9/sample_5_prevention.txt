**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:**  
   *Score: 5* - Neutral; it doesn't resonate strongly, but it's not outright disliked either.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting:**  
   *Score: 3 (Disagree)* - The claim feels too generic and lacks originality or creative engagement.

3. **I believe the ad is good:**  
   *Score: 4* - Somewhat agree; it gets the basic point across but doesn't stand out as well-crafted.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive:**  
   *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - The language feels manipulative and overly dramatic, which is off-putting.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase this product:**  
   *Score: 1* - Strongly disagree; even though I value health, the ad's approach doesn't inspire confidence or urgency.
   
2. **Will try to buy this product:**  
   *Score: 2 (Strongly Disagree)* - There’s no compelling reason based on this message alone to take an active step towards purchasing.

3. **Consider buying this product:**  
   *Score: 3* - Light consideration; I may look further into it if more credible information or a better-advertised benefit is presented elsewhere, but the current ad doesn't persuade me enough to act immediately. 

Overall, while there’s acknowledgment of its basic message, my reserved nature and preference for thoroughness make this advertisement unappealing and insufficiently persuasive on its own.
