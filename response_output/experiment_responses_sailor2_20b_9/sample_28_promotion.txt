**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude Scores:
- **I like the ad (6/7)**: As a talkative and outgoing individual, I appreciate marketing efforts that aim to energize daily life. However, personal experience with energy drinks is limited.
  
- **Interesting (5/7)**: The claim of staying "energized" resonates but it lacks depth or novelty for me; therefore, moderate interest.

- **Good (4/7)**: While I find the message well-intentioned, there's a neutral to slightly positive impact due to my cautious nature and general trust neutrality.

- **Attractive (3/7)**: The visual appeal might vary widely, but it lacks strong emotional engagement or connection. It’s not particularly compelling for me personally.

### Purchase Intention Scores:
- **Intend to purchase (2/7)**: Despite liking the ad's goals, I have reservations about energy drinks due to health concerns and budget constraints.
  
- **Will try to buy this product (1.5/7)**: Even though "try" is a possibility, it’s low given my financial limitations (<15,000,000 VND/month) and existing diet routine.

- **Consider buying (2/7)**: I'm open to considering energy drinks for occasional use but not as part of regular spending. Emotional stability combined with practicality keeps this intention moderate.

Overall, while the ad appeals on some levels, it doesn’t strongly motivate a purchase decision given my lifestyle and financial situation.
