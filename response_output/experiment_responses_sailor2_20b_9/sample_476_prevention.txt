**Explanation:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - *I like the ad.* (Score: 4): Neutral-leaning towards liking it. The prevention message might appeal moderately but not strongly.
   - *I think the ad is interesting.* (Score: 5): Slightly positive; the concept of avoiding tiredness and dull looks piques curiosity to a degree.
   - *I believe the ad is good.* (Score: 6): Generally agreeable, as it offers perceived benefits relevant for my age group and lifestyle.
   - *I find the ad attractive.* (Score: 3): Neutral with slight attraction. While engaging enough, its visual appeal might not be exceptional.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *I intend to purchase this product.* (Score: 2): Disagree; I don't have a strong intention due to limited budget concerns and skepticism about immediate need.
   - *I will try to buy this product.* (Score: 3): Neutral with slight willingness. Open-minded but cautious given the financial constraints.
   - *I will consider buying this product.* (Score: 4): Agree; while not an urgent priority, I'm open to considering it based on future needs or promotional offers.

Overall, the advertisement has a modest appeal, resonating slightly more with the promise of benefits. However, my cautious and cost-conscious nature means strong purchase intent is low but leaves room for contemplation under different circumstances.
