**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **Attitude toward the Advertisement**:  
   - **I like the ad (4)**: The message resonates with my desire to feel energized but isn't exceptionally captivating.
   - **Interesting (5)**: It presents an engaging problem-solving scenario, making it somewhat interesting.
   - **Good (3)**: While effective in its purpose of highlighting potential negative effects without the product, I find it slightly lacking in creativity and substance.
   - **Attractive (2)**: The ad falls short on attractiveness for me due to generic imagery often used in similar ads.

- **Purchase Intention**:  
   - **Intend to purchase this product (1)**: Despite understanding its value proposition, my current lifestyle and budget priorities don't align strongly enough with an immediate buy.
   - **Will try to buy this product (2)**: I might consider trying it out under specific circumstances, such as a demanding workweek or needing extra energy for social activities.
   - **Consider buying the product (3)**: While not high on my current shopping list, there's enough interest and potential usefulness to keep it in consideration if the situation warrants.

Overall, while acknowledging its utility, I'm more inclined towards trying rather than outright purchasing based on this ad. The strong agreement with carefulness and imagination traits allows me to appreciate prevention-focused messaging; however, my practical needs drive my purchase intention lower.
