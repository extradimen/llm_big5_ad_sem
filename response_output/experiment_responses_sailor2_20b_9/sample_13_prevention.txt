**Evaluation and Rationale:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **I like the ad:** *Score: 3 (Neutral)* - While neutral in talkativeness and sociability, my reserved nature makes me indifferent to attention-grabbing ads.
2. **I think the ad is interesting:** *Score: 2 (Disagree)* - The message feels overly dramatic and lacks relatability for someone who isn't naturally prone to worrying about appearance daily.
3. **I believe the ad is good:** *Score: 4 (Agree with caution)* - It's factually correct in highlighting tiredness and dull looks but doesn’t resonate deeply due to my focus on other priorities.
4. **I find the ad attractive:** *Score: 1 (Strongly Disagree)* - The negative emphasis ("without this drink, you may feel...") feels manipulative rather than appealing.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product:** *Score: 2 (Somewhat Agree but Not Strong Intent)* - Given my cautious nature and financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND), I’m not driven enough by the ad's message.
2. **I will try to buy this product:** *Score: 1 (Disagree)* - Lack of urgency or compelling benefit means it’s unlikely I’ll make an active effort to purchase.
3. **I will consider buying this product:** *Score: 1 (Disagree)* - Despite agreeing that the ad has some validity, my current lifestyle and priorities don't align with making this drink a priority.

Overall, while acknowledging its factual claims, the ad fails to resonate personally or drive strong intent due to my reserved nature, emotional tendencies, and practical financial considerations. Hence, low scores reflect cautiousness rather than outright rejection.
