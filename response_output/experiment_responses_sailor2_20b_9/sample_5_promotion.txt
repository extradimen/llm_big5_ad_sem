**Explanation:**

### Ad Attitude:
1. **Like**: Neutral to slightly positive (score = 3)
   - The ad appeals moderately due to its focus on energy and appearance, which resonate with my preferences for staying productive.
2. **Interesting**: Slightly agree (score = 4)
   - It piques curiosity about maintaining personal well-being but doesn't seem overly innovative or unique given the numerous similar products available.
3. **Good**: Agreeable (score = 5)
   - The message is clear and aligns with my values of staying energized, making it a credible promise for daily routine management.
4. **Attractive**: Neutral leaning towards slightly negative (score = 2)
   - While the benefits are appealing, I find some aspect missing that truly makes it stand out; visual presentation could be improved.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase**: Agree (score = 6)
   - Given my need for a reliable energy booster and concern about appearance, there's strong consideration for trying it.
2. **Will try to buy**: Strongly agree (score = 6)
   - The idea of testing the product aligns with being thorough in job-related responsibilities; willing to give it a shot despite reservations.
3. **Consider buying**: Strongly Agree (score = 7)
   - Even though I may not rush into purchasing, there's considerable intention and readiness to evaluate its effectiveness through use.

In summary, while slightly reserved about the adâ€™s attractiveness, I find significant value in the product promise and am highly inclined to explore it further. Thus, high purchase intentions despite a modest appeal rating.
