**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **I like the ad:** Neutral (2)
   - While it appeals somewhat, my reserved nature means I don't find it particularly engaging or captivating.

2. **Interesting:** Agree (4)
   - The promise of staying energized and looking great is appealing, especially for a busy student with postgraduate commitments.

3. **Good:** Agree (5)
   - The message resonates well in terms of functionality and health benefits, aligning with my values to stay productive but cautious about claims.

4. **Attractive:** Disagree (3)
   - Despite its positive aspects, the ad feels slightly generic and lacks a unique connection or emotional appeal for me.

**Purchase Intention:**

1. **Intend to purchase:** Neutral (2)
   - While I appreciate the idea, my current financial situation (income range) makes it less likely that I will immediately commit without further consideration of budget constraints.

2. **Try to buy:** Agree (4)
   - Given its potential benefits and alignment with daily needs, there's a reasonable chance I would give it a try if offered at an affordable price or during special promotions.

3. **Consider buying:** Agree (5)
   - The product fits my lifestyle goals, so even though cautious about impulsivity due to my tendency towards carelessness, overall, considering this purchase is high on the list.

By balancing my personality traits and practical considerations, I find myself moderately inclined toward both appreciating the ad's message and potentially giving it a try. However, final decision-making will depend on additional factors like price points and personal budgeting.
