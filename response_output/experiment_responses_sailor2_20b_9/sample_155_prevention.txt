**Evaluation:**

### **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
1. **I like the ad**: Agree (score = 4)
   - While it targets a common concern—feeling tired and looking dull—I find it somewhat generic and not particularly engaging.

2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral leaning towards agree (score = 5)
   - The message resonates with daily struggles, making it moderately interesting but lacks originality or uniqueness to captivate me fully.

3. **I believe the ad is good**: Disagree (score = 3)
   - It adequately addresses its target issue, but without compelling evidence or emotional connection, I view this as average rather than effective.

4. **I find the ad attractive**: Disagree (score = 2)
   - The presentation lacks creativity and fails to make a strong visual impact; it's forgettable for someone like me who values engaging ads more.

### **Purchase Intention**
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Strongly disagree (score = 1)
   - Despite understanding the problem, my immediate intention is low due to doubts about its efficacy and lack of compelling brand trust.

2. **I will try to buy this product**: Disagree (score = 2)
   - I might consider a trial if it's reasonably priced but won't actively seek out without better assurances or personal recommendations.

3. **I will consider buying this product**: Neutral leaning towards agree (score = 3)
   - With occasional fatigue, consideration remains open; however, other factors like price, brand reputation, and user reviews would significantly influence my decision.

Overall, the ad manages to connect with a genuine concern but falls short in terms of creativity, emotional appeal, and trust-building elements. Therefore, while it may get some baseline interest, it doesn't drive substantial purchase intent for me as an office worker seeking solutions authentically. Additional branding efforts or compelling proof points would be necessary to improve these scores.
