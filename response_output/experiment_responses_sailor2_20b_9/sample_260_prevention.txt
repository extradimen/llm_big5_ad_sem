**Evaluation:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement:**
   - **Like (3)**: I find it mildly engaging but not particularly compelling.
   - **Interesting (4)**: The concept is somewhat interesting due to its focus on energy and appearance, resonating with my need for staying active and alert as a civil servant.
   - **Good (5)**: It communicates clearly about the product's benefits, making logical sense in terms of alleviating fatigue and enhancing personal presentation.
   - **Attractive (6)**: The ad is reasonably attractive given its focus on practical improvements to daily well-being.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (2)**: While I acknowledge the potential value, a strong intent isn't there yet; other factors like brand reputation and cost would play significant roles.
   - **Try (3)**: There's moderate curiosity about giving it a try to see if it truly alleviates fatigue as promised.
   - **Consider (4)**: Definitely consider adding this product to my routine, particularly during stressful work periods or when needing an energy boost.

Overall, the ad is effective in raising awareness and generating mild interest. However, personal decision-making will depend on additional factors such as cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits relative to alternative solutions.
