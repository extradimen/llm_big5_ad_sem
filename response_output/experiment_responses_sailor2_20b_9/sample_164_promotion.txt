**Explanation:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement:**
   - **I like the ad (score = 4):** While I appreciate energy drinks for their practical benefits, my strong tendency towards being talkative and helpful makes me somewhat engaged but not excessively fond.
   - **Interesting (score = 3):** The promise of staying energized is appealing, though it doesn't stand out uniquely in a saturated market. Therefore, just moderately interesting.
   - **Good (score = 5):** It's well-made with clear benefits; however, neutral trust and slight skepticism about its claims pull the score down slightly from strong agreement.
   - **Attractive (score = 2):** Despite being generally emotionally stable, I find it somewhat generic and less visually compelling. The lack of distinctive imagery or messaging makes it unappealing.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend to purchase (score = 6):** Given my lifestyle and desire for energy boosters, combined with the strong belief in its potential benefits, I am highly inclined but not entirely committed.
   - **Will try to buy (score = 7):** My tendency towards making plans and following through means that this product aligns well with my proactive approach. Hence, a high likelihood of attempting a purchase if it meets expectations.
   - **Consider buying (score = 5):** Though I value being thorough and consider new products carefully, the moderate attractiveness and slight carelessness mean I will seriously evaluate its effectiveness before committing fully.

Overall, while not overly enthusiastic about the ad itself, there's strong intent to engage with the product due to practical benefits aligning with my personal needs.
