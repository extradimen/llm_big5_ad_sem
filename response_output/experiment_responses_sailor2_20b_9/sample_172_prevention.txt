**Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad**: Disagree (Score = 2) – The claim about feeling tired and looking dull is too generic; it doesn’t resonate with my personal experience or lifestyle.
2. **I think the ad is interesting**: Neutral (Score = 3) – While it presents a common issue, its execution feels uninspired, making it neither particularly engaging nor exciting.
3. **I believe the ad is good**: Disagree (Score = 4) – The simplicity and lack of compelling evidence undermine credibility for me; not convincing enough to consider as "good."
4. **I find the ad attractive**: Strongly Disagree (Score = 1) – Its straightforward message doesn't align with my preferences, making it unattractive.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product**: Neutral (Score = 2) – The advertisement is too vague; without more compelling reasons or personal relevance, I'm not motivated enough to make a strong intention.
2. **I will try to buy this product**: Slightly Agree (Score = 2) – There's some curiosity but not sufficient reason for me to actively seek out the purchase immediately.
3. **I will consider buying this product**: Considerable Interest (Score = 3) – While I don't strongly desire it, if offered at a good value or recommended by someone trustworthy, I might give it a chance.

In summary, while the ad's message touches on universal concerns, its execution and emotional appeal fall short. Thus, my attitude is generally negative but slightly open to considering the product under specific circumstances.
