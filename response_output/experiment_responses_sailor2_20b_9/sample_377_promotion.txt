**Evaluation and Rationale:**

1. **Attitude toward the Advertisement**
   - **Like (score = 3):** The ad seems decent but doesn't strongly resonate with me; it feels somewhat generic.
   - **Interesting (score = 2):** It's not particularly captivating due to a lack of unique selling points that stand out in my experience as an employee and consumer balancing multiple responsibilities.
   - **Good (score = 3):** The ad claims benefits like staying energized and looking best, which is generally good but lacks depth or personal connection for me personally.
   - **Attractive (score = 4):** Visually appealing if well-designed, yet the message feels more aspirational than tangible.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - **Intend to Purchase:** While I appreciate its promise of energy and appearance benefits (5), my current financial constraints (<15,000,000 VND/month) make me cautious about non-essential expenses.
   - **Will Try to Buy:** Given the agreeable attitude towards thorough job performance and planning, trying it once aligns with being open-minded but not a priority (6).
   - **Consider Buying:** Despite my high level of worry and need for staying energized, considering purchasing is moderate due to budget limitations and needing more evidence on effectiveness (6).

Overall, the ad appeals moderately while understanding practical considerations influence my final decision. The blend of helpful yet reserved approach balances positive intent with realistic expectations.
