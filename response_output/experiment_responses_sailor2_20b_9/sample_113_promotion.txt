**Explanation:**

1. **Ad Attitudes:**
   - **Like (5/7):** Neutral-to-positive; I find it okay but not exceptionally exciting.
   - **Interesting (6/7):** Strongly Agree; The promise of staying energized and looking good is appealing to my values as a young civil servant with an active social life.
   - **Good (4/7):** Agree; It conveys clear benefits, which resonate on some level but not overwhelmingly so.
   - **Attractive (7/7):** Strongly Agree; The adâ€™s visual and messaging are eye-catching, appealing to my generally sociable nature.

2. **Purchase Intention:**
   - **Intend (3/7):** Neutral-to-slightly positive; While the message aligns with personal goals, immediate purchase intent is not strong.
   - **Try (2/7):** Disagree; I might be inclined to give it a shot if offered in a promotional setting or by trusted friends/family.
   - **Consider (5/7):** Agree; The idea of boosting energy and appearance does make me consider this product for occasional use, aligning with my agreeable yet practical nature. 

Overall, the ad is effective enough to pique interest but doesn't drive a high-intensity purchase decision alone. I'm more likely to give it a try under favorable circumstances or as part of broader lifestyle adjustments.
