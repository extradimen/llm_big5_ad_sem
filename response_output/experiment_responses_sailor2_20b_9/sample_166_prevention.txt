**Evaluation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **I like the ad (4/7):**
   - Neutrally positive; resonates with my need for energy and appearance but not strongly enough to evoke strong affection.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (5/7):**
   - The message of fatigue relief draws mild interest, particularly relevant due to working hours in public service.

3. **I believe the ad is good (6/7):**
   - Generally positive because it addresses a common issue and presents an actionable solution, aligning with my goal-driven nature.

4. **I find the ad attractive (3/7):**
   - While not strongly appealing visually or emotionally, its content is somewhat engaging but lacks persuasive charm for me personally.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **I intend to purchase this product (2/7):**
   - Low likelihood; although understanding the potential benefits, daily budget constraints and cautious nature make a firm commitment unlikely.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (2/7):**
   - Similar intention as aboveâ€”might consider sampling or trying it out but not an urgent priority.

3. **I will consider buying this product (3/7):**
   - Open to considering if I face persistent fatigue issues and the cost feels justified against other lifestyle investments.

Overall, while acknowledging its relevance and potential benefits, my balanced approach means a neutral-to-positive view on the ad with cautious intent towards purchasing, reflecting practicality over impulse.
