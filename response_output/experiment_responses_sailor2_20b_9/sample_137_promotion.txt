**Evaluation Explanation:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement:
1. **Like (Score = 3)**:
   - As a reserved and practical civil servant with limited enthusiasm for talkative or sensational marketing content, I find it neutral to slightly positive.

2. **Interesting (Score = 4)**:
   - The concept of energy drinks is familiar, but without compelling new information, my interest remains moderate.

3. **Good (Score = 5)**:
   - It communicates a clear benefit (staying energized and looking good), which is appreciated, especially for maintaining daily productivity.
  
4. **Attractive (Score = 2)**:
   - The generic appeal may not strongly attract me due to personal preference towards more informative or tailored messages.

### Purchase Intention:
1. **Intend to purchase (Score = 1)**:
   - Given my reserved nature and cautious approach, the ad alone isn't convincing enough for a strong intent to buy.
   
2. **Will try to buy (Score = 2)**:
   - There's mild consideration due to its practical promises but not sufficient to push me into immediate action.

3. **Will consider buying (Score = 3)**:
   - It registers as an option I might explore further, particularly if recommendations or additional details align with my values of thoroughness and effectiveness in health choices.

Overall, the ad is moderately appreciated for its straightforward benefits but lacks the personalized appeal to drive a strong purchase decision. The cautious approach characteristic of civil servants like myself leans towards considering options rather than immediate action.
