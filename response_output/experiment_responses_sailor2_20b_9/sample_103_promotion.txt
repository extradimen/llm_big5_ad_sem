**Evaluation and Justification:**

1. **Ad Attitude Scores:**
   - **Like:** Neutral (3) – While the concept of staying energized appeals, it doesn't excite me intensely.
   - **Interesting:** Slightly Agree (4) – The idea is intriguing but not groundbreaking for my needs.
   - **Good:** Agree (5) – I see value in maintaining energy and appearance; hence, a positive perception.
   - **Attractive:** Disagree (2) – Personal preference leans towards more tailored or specific benefits rather than broad statements.

2. **Purchase Intention Scores:**
   - **Intend:** Neutral (3) – It’s an appealing concept but not compelling enough to drive immediate action without further research.
   - **Try:** Slightly Agree (4) – There's a willingness to give it a shot, especially considering its claimed benefits.
   - **Consider:** Agree (5) – The product aligns with my needs for energy and appearance maintenance; thus, I will evaluate based on reviews and personal experience.

This evaluation reflects balanced consideration of both the advertisement’s appeal and the intrinsic alignment with lifestyle goals while acknowledging the need for further exploration before making a purchase decision.
