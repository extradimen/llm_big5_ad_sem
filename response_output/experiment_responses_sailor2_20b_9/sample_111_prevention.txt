**Evaluation and Justification:**

### Attitude Toward the Advertisement

1. **I like the ad (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral to slightly disagree; while I understand the message about feeling tired and looking dull, it feels generic without compelling detail.
   
2. **I think the ad is interesting (Score: 3)**:
   - Moderately agree; the concept of preventing fatigue is relevant but not groundbreaking, making it somewhat engaging.

3. **I believe the ad is good (Score: 4)**:
   - Slightly agree; adequate in terms of conveying a common issue and potential solution, though lacking emotional depth or creativity.
   
4. **I find the ad attractive (Score: 1)**:
   - Strongly disagree; the appeal isn't strong enough to draw me emotionally or visually.

### Purchase Intention

1. **I intend to purchase this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Neutral leaning towards no intention; while health benefits are appealing, there's a lack of compelling evidence or personal connection.
   
2. **I will try to buy this product (Score: 2)**:
   - Slightly agree but not highly motivated; curiosity might prompt a trial purchase if other factors align.

3. **I will consider buying this product (Score: 3)**:
   - Neutral with some consideration; it falls into the category of products worth evaluating further, especially given its functional promise and my generally trustful nature regarding health drinks.

Overall, while acknowledging the relevance to common concerns about fatigue, the advertisement lacks emotional resonance or a compelling hook. Therefore, it moderately affects positive attitude but doesn't drive strong purchase intention without additional information or personal validation.
