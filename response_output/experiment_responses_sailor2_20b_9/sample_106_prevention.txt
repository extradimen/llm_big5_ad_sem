**Evaluation Details:**

1. **Attitude Toward the Advertisement**
   - *I like the ad*: Neutral (3). While not strongly negative, it doesn't significantly appeal due to some skepticism about over-exaggerated claims.
   - *Interesting*: Agree (4). The message resonates enough as a preventive measure against fatigue and dullness, making it intriguing.
   - *Good Advertisement*: Disagree (2). It feels somewhat manipulative with the implied consequences of not using their product, lacking robust evidence or balanced perspective.
   - *Attractive*: Neutral (3). Generally visually appealing but falls short on emotional connection given my preference for trust and thoroughness.

2. **Purchase Intention**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Agree (5). The ad’s focus aligns with managing fatigue, which is relevant in a busy managerial role.
   - *Try to Buy*: Agree (4). Willing to give it a try based on the promise of increased alertness and appearance improvement.
   - *Consider Buying*: Strongly Agree (5). Despite personal reservations about immediate trust in advertisements, I’m open-minded enough due to genuine need for energy boosters.

In summary, while some aspects of the ad are persuasive given its targeting of fatigue and aesthetics, skepticism from my personality traits like distrustfulness and thoroughness slightly diminish overall appeal. However, practical considerations push me towards a strong consideration and willingness to try or purchase the product.
