**Explanation:**

- **Ad Attitude:** 
   - *Like*: Neutral (4). While the ad's messaging is generic, it doesn't particularly resonate or excite me.
   - *Interesting*: Disagree (3). The claims are too common for energy and appearance; they lack novelty to hold my interest.
   - *Good*: Neutral (4). It appears well-produced but lacks a compelling unique selling point that stands out.
   - *Attractive*: Strongly Disagree (2). As someone who is reserved, I don't find the ad visually or emotionally appealing.

- **Purchase Intention:**
   - *Intend to Purchase*: Strongly Disagree (1). The appeal isnâ€™t strong enough given my reserved nature and low purchase budget.
   - *Try to Buy*: Disagree (2). Even though I'm open-minded, there are no compelling reasons for me to try this product over cheaper alternatives or homemade solutions.
   - *Consider Buying*: Neutral (3). While the idea of staying energized is appealing, cost and practicality still weigh heavily in my decision-making process.

Overall, while not completely dismissive, the ad doesn't inspire enough personal connection, urgency, or unique benefits to sway my purchase intention significantly.
